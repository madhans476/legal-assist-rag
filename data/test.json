Charges dropped on A4, A5, A6, A7(my brother, his wife and my uncle and his wife who are living in some other cities).      LW1 complainant wife   LW2 Her father   LW3 Her Mother      LW4 to LW9 are some independent witnesses.      I received all the statements of witness and most of them are lies and stories.      Material Evidence submitted to the court is as follows   1. Wedding card   2. Marriage photos   3. Copy of Bank Statements   4. Copy of other photos.(Drinking and party photos).      Now I have two Questions   1. Is there any chance that A4 to A7 can be charge sheeted again as I was threatened by the other party that they will put efforts to file charge sheet on A4 to A7. A4 to A7 has no connection to this case. The case file is out of the police station and CC number is also allocated.   2. There are some voice recordings with them and(2 to 3 CD's). Please let me know is there any chance that these CD's can be added to the material evidence later during trails or during the examination or if any petition filed by the complainant party in court submitting the CD's as additional evidence, as the case has already been sent to court and as per the current charge sheet, there is no CD attached to material evidence.",

She has had a troubled married life but still is staying in the marriage because she has no where else to go. Earlier it was because she was diabetic and not able to conceive a child and her mother in law and husband constantly use to harass her and beat her up. Once after relentless beating she filed a complaint in the police station in Chennai (Their place of residence when the incident occurred). Whatever gold she had got through the marriage has been taken away and pledged by her father in law for his personal purposes.   About two years back she gave birth to a child and they shifted their residence to Bangalore. Initially there was happiness in their life, but recently things have taken a bad turn as he started beating her up in silly issues such as food prepared for the day and so on. He also abuses her verbally, often referring her to as \"prostitute\" in the local language and says that the son does not belong to him and its from 10 other men she has slept with. He also called her sister and told him \"your sister wants to have sex daily, is she a prostitute\". Her son was studying in pre-school but he wont pay the fees and she had to work a small job to pay for the fees and manage her expenses with medicine and so on.   Last few days has been horrific, she almost fractured her hand and had to rush to hospital. I have asked to file a police complaint again but she wont as she is afraid that he might kill her.    He is also asking her to leave the house with their son as he can marry another woman and he was also stressing he will not give the gold and she do not dare to ask for a single rupee as alimony. She is does not want to continue in this marriage, but has no where else to go as her family wont support her much in this case. What steps should she seek that she can get support and get divorce in the future.",

This section deals with cruelty by a husband or his family towards a married woman. Four types of cruelty are dealt with by this law: 1.conduct that is likely to drive a woman to suicide, 2.conduct which is likely to cause grave injury to the life, limb or health of the woman, 3.harassment with the purpose of forcing the woman or her relatives to give some property, or 4.harassment because the woman or her relatives is unable to yield to demands for more money or does not give   some property. The punishment is imprisonment for up to three years and a fine. The complaint against cruelty need not be lodged by the person herself. Any relative may also make the complaint on her behalf. Hence, as per law of the land , your friend should get justice by following ways:- -- She should file a complaint to the Crime Women Cell(CWC) of her area ,after narrating all the wrong happenings with her by the husband or his family members. The lady official of the CWC will try to reconcile the matter in dispute with the husband, If the matter got resolved by the husband or he not appear before the CWC , then the complaint given by your friend will convert into FIR under various section of IPC like 498A. -- She should file a petition under Domestic violence Act before the court , where she can prayed for her interim maintenance and also accommodation etc from the court . --- She should file a complaint under section 125 crpc in the family court for her or child maintenance . Here the court will fix interim maintenance amount till the disposal of the case. The filing of the case or legal steps taken by her not amounting to divorce . If she wanted to continue with the husband during the trial in the court , the court will settle the matter in her favour as well .  -- Tell her to keep medical papers or other proofs of cruelty , if possible with her ,as it would speed the relief in her support.

                "response-text": "Hi  1) Since the land belongs to your great grand father, it is an ancestral property in the hands of your grand father, your father and uncles and their siblings.  2) Also in all likelihood, the property standing in the name of your grand father was also obtained through funds derived from ancestral property and hence the properties standing in the name of grand father will also assume the character of being ancestral property.  3) Assuming your great grand father was alive in the year 1956 and his daughters(your grand aunts) were married prior to 1986(prior to amendment of Hindu succession act by Shri.N.T.Rama rao) , the property will vest on your grand father only, but it will still be ancestral property. If daughters (your grand aunt's) were not married till 1986, then the property will vest with your grand father and his sisters(your grand aunt's). 4) Assuming your grand father alone was vested with the ancestral property, The property by virtue of it being ancestral property will be governed by Section 6 of Hindu succession act and as such your grand father can execute a WILL pertaining to his share of property (after his share in property is computed under Section 6 of Hindu Succession act). i.e grand father, your father, your uncle(father's brother), 2 sons of your uncle, 2 children of your father(i.e you and your sister) and grand mother 5) Your grand father would have got 1/8 share of ancestral property and he can execute a WILL to the extent of 1/8 of his share of property Only.  6) Since your uncle claims that his in-laws gave 1 lakh to your grand father, it is actually a dowry received by your uncle and as such it will be illegal to claim the said amount in the first place. Also the said money can never be accounted for in the year 2018 as your uncle if at all wanted to claim his share of property equivalent to 1lakh should have claimed the land way back in the year 1985. Law of limitation will NOT permit the said claim of 1 Lakh by your uncle and hence you can ignore the same.  7) Also any monies so contributed to common hotch pot of the ancestral family properties, cannot be claimed at a later point of time and it is only the present state of properties that are liable to be partitioned and hence the claim of your uncle will not pass the test of law.  8) Assuming you file a suit for partition in the court, the properties will be divided in equal shares between all of the co-parcenors( i.e grand father , grand mother(if both are alive), your father, your uncle(father's brother), 2 sons of your uncle, 2 children of your father(i.e you and your sister)  Hope this information is useful."

        "query-text": "Reflection dispute - short      HI,   My parents have bought an apartment in the Senior Living society in Bangalore. Being a senior living, there were several facilities which are covered as a \"Service agreement\", signed by each flat owner at the time of purchase for a 10year period.   Part of this service were \"Specialised services\" where based is payment based on package opted, from an available list.       After an initial period of 2 years, the builder along with the society, has decided to make most of the specialised services as compulsory (which as per contract was optional), without approval from each owner. Additional, there have been multiple irregularities in the billing related to the regular charges for service agreement. Even after multiple reminders by email to make corrections, the builder does not respond, just keeps sending bills with the same errors. They also threaten that the unpaid amounts will be deducted from refundable deposits. Now the builder has started interfering in daily services eg. domestic help.       All these violations have led to mental harassment health issues for my parents who are senior citizens.       I request your support to identify:   1. What legal rights do we have in this case?    2. Is there a way to stop the builder from harassing my parents with immediate effect?   3. How do we proceed on this matter - legally and otherwise to ensure that the builder does not make ilife difficult for them, continuously.      Thanks in advance.",

Such in-court representative shall have no issue with the local language of the place. You must hire a lawyer who has a background expertise in cases like these and is competent to represent your case at the court. It is further suggested that you can send a legal notice to the builder warning him to comply to the provisions of the Contract and not practice beyond it for monetary gains.

                "response-text": "From examining all the facts of your query I want to say that- I can understand your mother\u2019s problem in this regard. These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I have dealt with such cases in Supreme Court. Large unpaid debts and continuing defaults by borrowers require the banks and financial institutions to initiate proceedings for recovery of dues against the principal borrowers as well as the guarantors under various legislations and forums, including the Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 for enforcement of security against the guarantors and under the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 before the Debt Recovery Tribunals for recovery of debt against the guarantors. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, which came into force on December 1, 2016, as a consolidated legislation to deal with insolvent and bankrupt persons, both natural and artificial, is also assisting the financial institutions to initiate corporate debt resolution process against guarantors. There are already many cases against M/S. Shriram Chits Ltd. in Supreme Court of India, Madras High Court, Andhra High Court, Karnataka High Court. To my mind the concept of guarantee is governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1882 (\"ICA\"), where under the contract of guarantee puts an obligation on a surety to honour the promise of principal debtor by paying the principal debtor's present or future debt, provided to him by a creditor in case of default by the principal debtor. The liability of a guarantor is co-extensive with the liability of the principal debtor and can be invoked without exhausting the remedies against the principal debtor, unless otherwise provided in the contract (of guarantee), i.e. certain exceptions could be created at the time of execution of the contract of guarantee vis-a-vis the obligations of the guarantor. However, limited rights have been provided to the guarantor that may assist him in discharging him from his liabilities in his capacity as a guarantor/surety. Even the RBI's circular dated September 9, 2014 issued with reference to the Master Circular on Wilful Defaulters DBOD.No.CID.BC.3/20.16.003/2014-15 dated July 1, 2014, clarified that when a payment default is made by the principal debtor, the bank is entitled to proceed against the guarantor/surety even without exhausting the remedies against the principal debtor. In case the said guarantor refuses to comply with the demand made by the creditor/bank, despite having sufficient means to make payment of the dues, such guarantor would also be treated as a 'wilful defaulter'. Two options are available for your mother.  In case where a guarantee has been obtained by means of misrepresentation made by the creditor or with his/her knowledge and consent, concerning a material part of the transaction, such a guarantee is invalid. In terms of Section 142 of Indian Contract Act any guarantee which has been obtained by means of misrepresentation made by the creditor, or with his knowledge and assent, concerning a material part of the transaction, is invalid. One additional ground that can be taken by the guarantor is that the guarantee was obtained by the creditor by means of keeping silence as to certain material circumstances and in such circumstances the guarantee can be challenged as invalid.  In the matter of Krishan Kumar vs. Syndicate bank & Ors. it was argued that the guarantor did not give any guarantee and had not signed any document undertaking to pay any money to the bank in the event of defendant no. 1 (principal borrower) failed to repay the same and the guarantor contended forgery by the bank manager. Court held that the finding of the trial court in holding the guarantor liable as much as the principal borrower was erroneous in light of the fact that the plaintiff bank had miserably failed to prove the authenticity of the guarantee forming the subject matter of the case. Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete facts. You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification. I hope you and your family are safe and healthy. Stay home and be safe during Covid-19.   Gopal Verma, Advocate on Record & Amicus Curiae, Supreme Court of India"

For this agreement we took 1 lakh as advance in the total consideration of 7 lakhs. After entering into the agreement, the buyer forced us to bring my sisters to sign at the time of registration, for which we refused to do so because it is our mistake that we did not informed our sisters about the agreement.      Meanwhile in this period the arguments took place and we wanted to cancel the agreement as earlier the buyer himself promised us that whenever we want to step back or cancel this transaction   So we can. But after this agreement & arguments he threatened & informed everything to my sisters about this. Now my sisters are serious on me for this.      In spite of this the buyer filed a suit for specific performance. Even we along with our sisters filed a suit for cancellation of the agreement. My sisters are not ready to sell the property.

After police charged rape case against him, their family approached us for settlement and they were pretending nice to us and appologised for everything that happened .. Hence I trusted them and they exploited my innocence.. He managed to get anticipatory bail consequently me filing an affidavit stating no objection in granting bail and we promised before court in the affidavit that we will live together as husband and wife ..he also stated that triple talaq wasnt properly announced and so he wanted to take me back as his wife... I trusted his family's words and I gave 164 statement that all disputes between us have been settled and we are living as husband and wife .. but once he realised he is in safe zone and he got anticipatory bail, he started to manhandle me and beat me after consuming alcohol... he even wanted me to be his secret wife... he threatened me not to inform about our reconcilation in his native place ...three weeks later ( after I gave 164 statement ) he started torturing me and he even tried to commit attempt to culpable homicide on me .. he injured me on my face with sharp glass pieces and I was hospitalised for two days.. finally police has charged the seventh crime on him under section 324 and subsequently they added 308...      Also he violated the conditions in the anticipatory bail which he got under section 376( not to involve in any other offence while on bail ) as seventh crime of 308 registered against him...      I am waiting for the court verdict regarding cancellation of his bail... I have also lodged a case claiming for maintenance...I havent filed domestic violence case as I am advised that I cant claim amount for both maintenance and domestic violence.. I was cruelly harassed and ill treated by him and I still have the scars on my face after that 308 incident... Now I am fighting for my justice but I fear if he will escape from the law as earlier I filed an affidavit believing his false appology...         Police didnt rearrest him on 308 crime as they initially released him on bail charging 324... 308 was subsequently added to the same FIR after I met district police chief ... is there any legal option for police to rearrest him ??? Also since he involved in another offence(308) while on bail will the court cancel his bail and remand him ??? Kindly suggest me the best legal advise for my justice...",

A person admitted to bail by the High Court could be committed to custody only by the High Court. Similarly, a High Court has power to stay bail order passed by Session Courts, if it thinks appropriate to do so. A Court of Session can cancel the bail granted by itself and cannot cancel a bail granted by the High Court unless new circumstances arise during the progress of the trial after an accused person has been admitted to bail by the High Court. If a Court of Session had admitted an accused to bail, the State may either move the Sessions Judge if certain new circumstances have arisen which were not earlier known to the State; or the State may approach the High Court being the Supreme Court under Section 439(2) to commit the accused to custody. Section 437(5) confers on the High Court the power to cause any person who has been released under Section 437 to be arrested and commit him to custody. Section 439(2) of the Code empowers the High Court to cause any person who has been admitted to bail under Section 439(1) of the Code to be arrested and commit him to custody. The Supreme Court has also power to cancel bail allowed by the High Court if there is a wrong exercise of discretion by the High Court. Cancellation of bail can be ordered only on stronger grounds, namely, a bail order having been procured on misrepresentation of facts, bench selection, on inadequate improper exercise of discretion by the judges or on the proof of the accused interfering with investigation or trial."

The street / road in front of my house is a 12 feet road. My neighbor in front of my house runs a motor repairing workshop. It a mid size shop where the family (father, and son) along with one to two workers do their work. They work on submersible pumps and electrical motor starting from 2HP to around 40 / 50 HP. They have not installed any major electrical machines for this work as they do mostly repairing and motor binding work. They used to live in the same house and work. My issue is noise pollution and disturbance due to commercial nature of their activity.   Noise pollution \u2013 due the nature of their work, they required to use hammer which creates lot of noise pollution. Also they need to load / unload the motors resulting in heavy noise. Whenever we are doing any routine activity in our home (watching TV / talking on phone, children study or sleeping during the day it creates a lot of discomfort)   disturbance due to commercial nature of their activity \u2013 these people has a small pickup van from which they continuously do loading / unloading of motors. Due to nature of their activity lot of people visit their house, resulting in unnecessary parking on the road.   Story till now : we are facing this issue from last two years. I live in other city due to my job location. Only my father & mother lives in our home. My father is 61 years of age and a heart patient, suffering a lot due to sound pollution. We have talked to these people two / three times but they are not ready to amend their ways. I filed a police compliant in June 2020 . but got no remedy, as other party has good liaison with police. Their very close relative is posted in gurgaon police itself ( in another police station), he easily influenced the cops.    The other neighbours are also support us and try to resolve the issue socially but other party is very adamant and not ready to correct themselves. We are most effected out of all residents as our houses are just in form of each other. The other neighbours are supportive when it comes to discussions but not ready to sign any application against them, due the social pressure etc.    I have visited noise pollution department, they said it is in village / residential area and they cannot approach directly to this matter. They advised to make a application to SDM. I contacted my lawyer to draft and help me to file the application. He told application should be filed as per sec 91 CPC. Which he said is not possible as it requires at least one more person to sign the application. He also shared their ground of my discomfort my not hold much weightage during further proceedings in front of officer, as other party will claim their right to earn livelihood.    Now I am confused. What are remedies available to me as we are suffering from noise pollution and kind of commercial activity",

A legally significant objective definition of noise is a complex and difficult to discern, for noise is not purely a matter of acoustics but of psychology. Subjective factors such as mental attitude, environment, time and place, etc., are important in the determination of actionable noise, which differ and are hard to quantify. The law cannot take into account every unwanted noise. On the oth6r hand, any sound, which becomes excessive, unnecessary or unreasonable, has to be put under regulation in order to shield public against unbearable and harmful noise or for its cessation.

Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000 Union Government on 14 February 2000 enacted the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000 in exercise of its power conferred under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to control the increasing ambient noise level in public places from various sources. The Rule 5 of the Noise Rules 2000 restricts the use of loud speakers/public address system. The Rule 5 was amended in 2010 to restrict the use of sound producing equipment's also. In all these cases a written permission is necessary for using such equipment.   District Magistrate, Police Commissioner and other officer not below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police are the implementing authroity under the Noise Rules, 2000. The State Government has been empowered to grant permission to use loudspeaker on or during any cultural or religious festive occasion of limited duration not exceeding fifteen days in all during the calendar year. But such relaxation is not permissible between 10 PM and 12 midnight.   The Supreme Court bench of Chief Justice of India RC Lahoti and Justice Ashok Bhan in Re: Noise Pollution \u00db ... vs Unknown case issued sweeping direction on the use of loudspeakers and horns, even noise produced in private residences. The directions also covered the noise generated from fire crackers, loudspeakers, vehicular noise, etc. Court also stressed the need for education in this regard in text books. It banned the use of loudspeakers between 10 pm and 6 am in public places (except in emergencies)   The decibel level of megaphones or public address systems should not exceed 10 dB (A) above the ambient noise standards for the area, or 75 dB (A), whichever is lower. The court issued sweeping direction with respect to noise pollution under exercise of its powers under Articles 141 and 142 of the Indian Constitution, which rendered them the authority of law of the land till such time as parliament, legislated on the problem. Other High Courts judgments Kerala HC held that singing of devotional songs by religious institutions should be inconformity with the rules. Whatever be the justification for playing devolution songs in the early morning and at dusk or at any time it has to be in conformity with the rules that are in force. Madras HC had the occasion to consider the use of loudspeaker in a temple. HC held that rule of law is more than anything else requires that all laws as enacted by Parliament and State Legislatures be faithfully executed by officials, that orders of Courts be obeyed. Calcutta HC applied the principle of judicial activism while deciding an issue as to whether the prohibition of manufacturing of noise polluting fireworks is valid. Judicial activism confers power upon the court to be active and not remain inactive for the purpose of protecting rights, duties and obligations of the people. Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) (Amendment) Rules, 2010 The Noise Rules, 2000 were amended in 2010 to include the words \"fire crackers and sound polluting instruments.\"   So you can file a case against the ones creating the pollution. initially, you can send them a legal notice, if they continue creating the pollution, you can file a suit against them with the help of a lawyer.    ."

If your brother in law has been charged under section 302, a bail application at this stage may not be entertained by the sessions court, however you may apply for bail and get it dismissed and then approach high court with a similar application where there are chances for getting enlarged on bail based on the satisfactory arguments presented and convinced by the court. You cannot pressurise the police to amend the sections, however you can file a petition before the concerned magistrate court for reinvestigation on the basis of your side merits in the case. The incidences what you have narrated can be taken up during trial only. You may file an application under section 173 (8) of cr.p.c. for reinvestigation then to bring the facts of the case to light.

All of these are serious offences and if she files a complaint you'll immediately have to engage the services of any advocate. Move an application for anticipatory breach. And later prepare your case to defend yourself. The lady will not get the public prosecutor. Public prosecutor appears for the Police, and presents all the evidences that police has collected. If there is no evidence, he is legally bound to tell the truth.  If this happened 2 years back then her case will become very weak. A lot of courts have time and again held that if the girl gives consent to engage into sexual relations on the promise of marriage, and later the person does not marry, it will not amount to an offence.  In order to prove that you did not make promises, several factors would be taken into consideration such as: Nature of promise, education and age of girl (whether she could have been fooled like this), your conduct all throughout these years etc. There are a 100s of factors involved and they depend on case to case basis.

JUDGMENT PRONOUNCED ON :- MAY 6, 2011. JUDGMENT (Per A.M.Khanwilkar, J.) : 1. This appeal takes exception to the Judgment and Decree passed by the Family Court No.3, Pune dated 31st March, 2009 in Petition No.A-877/2007. The respondent/wife filed Petition for a decree of divorce on the ground of cruelty. The said Petition was contested by the appellant/husband by filing written statement and counter claim. The appellant also prayed for custody of children. 2. The marriage between the appellant (husband) and respondent (wife) was solemnized on 12th August, 1993 at Pune as per the Hindu Vedic rites. After their marriage, they lived and cohabited together initially at Moscow, then at France and lastly at Pune. Two children are born out of the said wedlock namely; daughter Lavanya born on 22nd June, 1995 and son Rahul born on 11th January, 1999. The children are in the care and custody of the respondent mother. The parties started living separately since June, 2006. Since then, there has been no cohabitation between them. 3. During the pendency of the abovesaid Petition, the parties decided to take divorce by mutual consent. Accordingly, Consent Terms were executed and signed by both of them on 6th October, 2008, which were placed on record before the Family Court being Exhibit 71. The parties thereafter jointly filed application at Exhibit 72 to convert the Petition for divorce into joint Petition for divorce by mutual consent. As per the Consent Terms, the appellant had agreed that the custody of both the children would remain with the respondent wife. The respondent wife on the other hand, agreed to give access of both the children to the appellant during the weekend on every Sunday at the designated place and time and during the Diwali and Christmas vacations every day at the same venue and same time. Insofar as summer vacation, temporary custody of both the children was to be given to the appellant husband for the first half of the vacation when he could take the children away from Pune for vacation under intimation to the respondent wife. The parties also agreed that they would jointly take decision in respect of education and other activities of the children. The appellant agreed to pay maintenance of Rs.5,000/- per month for each child with increase at the rate of 15% every two years. The respondent wife waived her claim of maintenance and alimony and her streedhan. The respondent wife also agreed to cooperate with the appellant husband for the transfer of shares, properties-movable and immovable of the respondent in Company KAPEXL Healthcare Private Limited. Besides, both parties agreed to withdraw all the criminal and civil proceedings filed against each other. 4. After filing of Consent Terms recording the above arrangement, the hearing was deferred for some time. The Advocate for the appellant thereafter withdrew his Vakalatnama and on 16th February, 2009, the appellant filed application Exhibit 80 to withdraw his consent given on the application Exhibit 71 to grant divorce by mutual consent. The sole reason mentioned in this application is that the respondent wife failed to comply with her obligation to provide access of the children to the appellant husband. He has asserted that he was therefore withdrawing his consent, keeping in mind the paramount interest and welfare of the children. The said application Exhibit 80 was resisted by the respondent wife by filing reply Exhibit 81. According to the respondent, she never refused to grant access of children to the appellant. Whereas, the appellant was arrested in connection with various criminal matters and could not avail of access during the relevant period, as he was in jail. In substance, she refuted the allegations in application Exhibit 80 that she failed to comply with any of the terms of Consent Terms executed between the parties. She has also asserted that the children were not keen on meeting the appellant and refused to accompany the appellant, which fact was known to the appellant. She also asserted that the appellant was not paying maintenance amount regularly and was in arrears. She also brought on record that after execution of the Consent Terms, she facilitated disposal of criminal cases filed against the appellant husband being case No.560/2007 for offence under Section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code and case No.66/2008 for offence of theft. Besides, as per the Consent Terms, she also informed the Police Station of Hadapsar Police Station to withdraw all pending complaints against the appellant. 5. Considering the stand taken by the rival parties, the Family Court framed points for determination, amongst others, whether the application filed by the appellant Exhibit 80 to withdraw the consent recorded in the Consent Terms should be allowed and whether decree of divorce by mutual consent under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (hereinafter referred to as `the Act\u2019), should be passed. 6. Dealing with the first point, the Family Court took the view that the appellant cannot be allowed to withdraw his consent in the fact situation of the present case. The learned Judge held that the only ground pressed into service by the appellant justifying withdrawal of consent for passing decree of divorce by mutual consent, was untenable and devoid of merits. The learned Judge relying on the case law pressed into service by the parties took the view that the appellant cannot be allowed to withdraw his consent and instead, the Consent Terms executed between the parties ought to be taken on record and decree of divorce by mutual consent on the basis of the said Consent Terms was inevitable. 7. In the present appeal, the view so taken by the Family Court has been assailed. According to the appellant, since the Petition was one under Section 13B of the Act, the same could be taken forward only if both the parties continued to support the same till the date of the decree. Whereas, even if one party to the said application were to resile from or withdraw his/her consent, the Court cannot get jurisdiction to pass a decree of divorce by mutual consent. To buttress this argument, reliance is placed on the decision of the Apex Court in Smt.Sureshta Devi vs.Om Prakash reported in I (1991) DMC 313. Reliance is also placed on another decision in the case of Rupali alias Chetna vs. Sunil Data reported in AIR 2006 Punjab and Haryana 93. In that view of the matter, contends learned Counsel, the impugned decree of divorce as passed cannot be sustained in law. 8. On the other hand, Counsel for the respondent would contend that there is no infirmity either in the approach or the conclusion reached by the Family Court. The learned Counsel contends that considering the factual matrix of this case, it is more than clear that the respondent acted upon the Consent Terms executed between the parties to her prejudice, for which reason, the appellant cannot be permitted to resile from the commitment made in the Consent Terms and more particularly, because he has taken benefit of the Consent Terms. It is contended that the decree of divorce by mutual consent as passed by the Family Court in the fact situation of the present case, was inevitable. 9. To buttress this submission, learned Counsel for the respondent has placed reliance on the decisions in the case of Sudhakar Vinayak Joshi v. Sulabha Sudhakar Joshi reported in (1985) 87 Bom.L.R. 496, Rajesh Pratap Sainani v. Mrs.Bhavna Rajesh Sainani \u2013 2008 (6) Mh.L.J. 853 and Apurba Mohan Ghosh v. Manashi Ghosh \u2013 AIR 1989 Cal.115. 10. After having given our anxious consideration to the arguments advanced by the respective Counsel and going through the record of the case and more so, the legal position enunciated in the above said decisions, it may appear that ordinarily in a Petition filed under Section 13B of the Act, the consent and willingness of the parties to invite decree of divorce should not only be present when the Petition is filed but should also continue till the Court passes a decree on due satisfaction that the consent was voluntary and not obtained by force, fraud or undue influence. In other words, none of the party to a Petition for divorce by mutual consent under Section 13B of the Act of 1955, should withdraw the consent before passing of the decree of divorce. Further, it is open to the party to a Petition for divorce by mutual consent to unilaterally withdraw his/her consent within the specified period and including before the decree of divorce on the Petition filed under Section 13B of the Act is passed. It is not as if the consent given for filing the joint Petition for divorce by mutual consent is irrevocable. This legal position is reinforced from the decision of the Apex Court in the case of Sureshta Devi (supra). In paragraphs 13 to 15 of the said reported decision, the Apex Court expounded as follows:- >\"13. From the analysis of the Section, it will be >apparent that the filing of the petition with mutual >consent does not authorise the court to make a decree >for divorce. There is a period of waiting from 6 to 18 >months. This interregnum was obviously intended to >give time and opportunity to the parties to reflect on >their move and seek advice from relations and friends. >IN this transitional period one of the parties may >have a second thought and change the mind not to >proceed with the petition. The spouse may not be a >party to the joint motion under Sub-section (2). There >is nothing in the Section which prevents such course. >The Section does not provide that if there is a change >of mind it should not be by one party alone, but by >both. The High Courts of Bombay and Delhi have >proceeded on the ground that the crucial time for >giving mutual consent for divorce is the time of >filing the petition and not the time when they >subsequently move for divorce decrees. This appears to >be untenable. At the time of the petition by mutual >consent, the parties are not unaware that their >petition does not by itself snap marital ties. They >know that they have to take a further step to snap >marital ties. Sub-section (2) of Section 13-B is clear >on this point. It provides that \"on the motion of both >the parties \u2026. if the petition is not withdrawn in >the meantime, the court shall \u2026.. pass a decree of >divorce \u2026.\" What is significant in this provision is >that there should also be mutual consent when they >move the court with a request to pass a decree of >divorce. Secondly, the court shall be satisfied about >the bona fides and the consent of the parties. If >there is no mutual consent at the time of the enquiry, >the court gets no jurisdiction to make a decree for >divorce. If the view is otherwise, the Court could >make an enquiry and pass a divorce decree even at the >instance of one of the parties and against the consent >of the other. Such a decree cannot be regarded as >decree by mutual consent. > >14. Sub-section (2) requires the Court to hear the >parties which means both the parties. If one of the >parties at that stage says that \"I have withdrawn my >consent\", or \"I am not a willing party to the >divorce\", the Court cannot pass a decree of divorce by >mutual consent. If the Court is held to have the power >to make a decree solely based on the initial petition, >it negates the whole idea of mutuality and consent for >divorce. Mutual consent to the divorce is a sine qua >non for passing a decree for divorce under Section 13- >B. Mutual consent should continue till the divorce >decree is passed. It is a positive requirement for the >Court to pass a decree of divorce. \"The consent must >continue to decree nisi and must be valid subsisting >consent when the case is heard. [See (i) Halsbury laws >of England, Fourth Edition, Vol. 13 para 645; (ii) >Rayden on Divorce, 12th Ed. Vol.1 P. 291 and (iii) >Beales v. Beales, 1972 (2) All E.R., 667 at 674.] > >15. In our view, the interpretation given to the >section by the High Courts of Kerala, Punjab and >Haryana and Rajasthan in the aforesaid decisions >appears to be correct and we affirm that view. The >decisions of the High Courts of Bombay, Delhi and >Madhya Pradesh (supra) cannot be said to have laid >down the law correctly and they stand overruled.\" 11. The statement of law in Sureshta Devi (supra) is in the backdrop of the controversy before the Apex Court, wherein, the appellant-wife was signatory to the joint Petition for divorce by mutual consent filed in the Family Court on 8th January, 1985. Her statement was recorded by the Court on 9th January, 1985. However, on 15th January, 1985, she filed application in the Court alleging that her statement was obtained under pressure and threat of the husband. She was not allowed to see or meet her relations and to consult them before filing of the divorce petition. Nor her relations were permitted to accompany her to Court. Hence, she asserted that she does not want to be party to the petition and prayed that the same be dismissed. 12. Applying the abovesaid exposition, coupled with the fact that the appellant withdrew his consent vide Exhibit 80, it may appear as if the Family Court exceeded its jurisdiction in passing the decree of divorce by mutual consent. However, what is significant to bear in mind, is that, in the present case, the parties had not in the first instance resorted to Petition under Section 13B of the Act. Whereas, the respondent had filed Petition for a decree of divorce on the ground of cruelty against the appellant/husband on 7th September, 2007. Even the appellant/husband in the written statement and counter claim filed on 9th April, 2008, prayed for dissolution of the marriage. The parties during the pendency of the said proceedings decided to compromise the matter. Accordingly, they entered into Consent Terms (Exhibit 71) which were duly executed by the parties on 6th October, 2008. Amongst the several terms agreed upon between the parties to bring quietus to the entire dispute, they chose to convert the pending Petition for divorce into a joint Petition for divorce by mutual consent and withdraw all allegations against each other. Not only that, the parties immediately acted upon the said Consent Terms. The respondent, as per the terms of Consent Terms, offered access of both the children to the appellant. It is a different matter that the access did not fructify for reasons stated by the respondent. That plea of the respondent has been accepted by the Family Court. On this finding, the sole ground stated by the appellant as justification to withdraw the consent given for decree of divorce by mutual consent becomes unavailable. In any case, the said justification, even if it were to be accepted, would, at best, be a case bordering on noncompliance of the terms and conditions of the Consent Terms. 13. Notably, in the application filed by the appellant for withdrawing his consent (Exhibit-80), no material facts have been pleaded to even remotely suggest that he had signed the Consent Terms (Exhibit-71) due to force, fraud or undue influence. In other words, the parties having acted upon the Consent Terms in part and more particularly, the respondent-wife having acted to her detriment, including having withdrawn the criminal cases filed against the appellant, the appellant cannot be allowed to extricate himself from his commitment. In such a situation, in absence of assertion that the consent was obtained by force, fraud or undue influence, by virtue of Section 23(1)(bb) read with Section 23(1)(e) of the Act of 1955, the Court would assume jurisdiction to pass a decree under Section 13B on being satisfied that a marriage was solemnized between the parties and that the averments in the petition are true. As regards the grievance of the appellant regarding non-observance of the terms and conditions of the Consent Terms, the Court can always grant liberty to the parties to pursue the remedy in that regard \u2013 which will have to be decided on its own merits. 14. Be that as it may, what is significant to note is that under the Consent Terms (Exhibit-71), the respondent had also voluntarily waived her claim of maintenance and alimony and her streedhan. She also agreed to cooperate with the appellant to transfer the shares, properties \u2013 movable and immovable to the appellant. Further, she agreed to withdraw all the criminal and civil proceedings filed by her against the appellant. She acted upon the said terms as were agreed between the parties vide Consent Terms dated 6th October, 2008 at Exhibit 71, before the appellant filed the application Exhibit 80 on 16th February, 2009 to withdraw his consent. Somewhat similar situation was considered by the learned Single Judge of this Court in a recent decision in the case of Rajesh Pratap Sainani (supra). Even in that case, the petitioner before the High Court had challenged the order passed by the Family Court refusing to permit the petitioner to withdraw his consent and to dismiss the Petition under section 13B (2). In that case also, the original proceeding filed between the parties was one under Section 9 for decree of restitution of conjugal rights and not under Section 13B of the Act of 1955. When the said Petition was pending, criminal complaint was filed by the wife against the husband for offence under Section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code. Thereafter, the parties realized that their marriage was irreconcilable and there was no possibility to save the same. Accordingly, they filed application under Section 13B of the Act for a decree of divorce by mutual consent, which was duly signed by both the parties. While the said application was pending, the husband moved the Family Court to permit him to withdraw his consent and to dismiss the Petition under Section 13B of the Act. The Court found that the wife had already acted upon the Consent Terms. In that, before the husband moved application for withdrawal of consent, she withdrew the criminal complaint filed against the husband \u2013 as is the case on hand. She also returned the ornaments which were given to her in marriage by husband\u2019s family. She waived her right to present and future maintenance including that of minor son. The wife was made to agree to a limited custody of minor son and access to the husband. The wife was also saddled with the liability of son\u2019s future education and welfare. The Family Court, therefore, rejected the husband\u2019s application for allowing him to withdraw the consent to decree of divorce by mutual consent, as the wife had already acted upon the terms of compromise to her prejudice, on the basis of the representation made by her husband. The Court invoked the principle of doctrine of Estoppel to uphold the order of the Family Court disallowing the prayer of the husband for withdrawing his consent. The Court observed that the husband cannot be permitted to take advantage of his own wrong. Further, the Family Court cannot be a helpless spectator inspite of the duplicity of the husband to induce the hapless wife to waive her maintenance claim and to withdraw the criminal complaints with the hope of starting her life afresh. The Court went on to observe that if the husband was allowed to withdraw his consent, it would be nothing short of husband resorting to fraud and misrepresentation, which cannot be permitted by the Courts of Law and Equity. The Court further observed that in such situations, no spouse can be allowed to withdraw consent unilaterally, unless he/she was able to substantiate a just cause to the satisfaction of the Court. 15. In another reported decision of this Court in the case of Sudhakar Joshi (supra), on which reliance is placed by the respondent, the husband had filed Petition for divorce on the ground of desertion, cruelty and adultery. During the pendency of the said Petition, parties filed Petition for divorce by consent. However, after filing of such Petition, one party continued to remain absent. The Trial Court opined that if one of the spouse remains absent, he had no jurisdiction to pass the decree for divorce in favour of the spouse who attends the Court. The learned Single Judge of this Court overturned the conclusion of the Trial Court by observing that a decree of divorce could be granted on the ground of desertion as Advocates for parties agreed to pass such a decree. The Court then referred to the provisions of Order XXIII Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure. It observed that before advent of Section 13B on the Statute Book, it was not possible for the Trial Court to resort to Order XXIII Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure. It went on to hold that with the legislative change, the Court can now decree even a Petition for divorce filed under Section the Act, by consent of the parties, if the Court were to be satisfied that such a decree was not collusive one. It further observed that the provisions of Section 13B and Section 23(1)(c) of the Act were mutually inconsistent. We do not agree with such a wide statement of law. For, the petition under section 13B stands on a completely different pedestal. The procedure to try the said petition is well defined in Section 13B read with Sections 23(1) (bb) and Section 23(1)(e) of the Act of 1955. These provisions are self contained Code. Whereas, while trying the petitions for divorce on grounds other than Section 13B, the mandate of the relevant provisions such as Section 13 read with Section 23 of the Act (except Section 23(1) (bb)) would apply. In the latter cases for a decree of divorce, the Court is obliged to record its satisfaction on the basis of evidence before it in respect of the ground alleged by the petitioner or respondent, as the case may be. The Apex Court in the case of Balwinder Kaur vs. Hardeep Singh (1997) 11 SCC 701 held that Section 23 of the Act of 1955 mandates the Court before granting decree for divorce, \u201cwhether defended or not\u201d, to satisfy itself in respect of several factors mentioned in that Section and including duty in respect of conciliation efforts. Suffice it to hold that petitions on grounds other than petition for a decree of divorce by mutual consent under Section 13B of the Act, cannot be disposed of merely on the basis of compromise by invoking Order XXIII Rule 3 of the CPC. We are of the view that insertion of Section 13B and Section 23(1)(bb) by Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act 1976 (68 of 1976), which came into force with effect from 27th May, 1976, was not to dilute the mandate under other provisions casting duty on the Court to be satisfied about the existence of the stated ground as condition precedent, before passing a decree in terms of the reliefs claimed in the Petition. We would, however, agree with the exposition of the Calcutta High Court in the case of Apurba Ghosh (supra) that, decree of divorce in a Petition under Section 13 of the Act cannot be passed solely on the basis of compromise by resorting to provisions of Order XXIII Rule 3. Whereas, even the Court must be satisfied that a ground for divorce in the Statute can be traced from the record 16. As aforesaid, if the Petition is filed \u201csimplicitor under Section 13B of the Act\u201d for divorce by mutual consent, the Court must satisfy itself that the consent given by the parties continues till the date of granting decree of divorce. Even if one party unilaterally withdraws his/her consent, the Court does not get jurisdiction to grant decree of divorce by mutual consent in view of the mandate of Section 13B of the Act. However, the situation would be different if the parties in the first instance resort to Petition for relief under Section 9 or 13 of the Act and during the pendency of such Petition, they decide to invite decree for divorce by mutual consent. On the basis of agreed arrangement, if the parties were to execute Consent Terms and then file a formal Petition/Application to convert the pending Petition to be treated as having been filed under Section 13B of the Act to grant decree of divorce by mutual consent, then, in the latter proceedings, before the decree is passed, one party cannot be allowed to unilaterally withdraw the consent if the other party has already acted upon the Consent Terms either wholly or in part to his/her detriment. In other words, the Court will have to be satisfied that: (i) there is sufficient, good and just cause for allowing the party to withdraw his consent, lest, it results in permitting the party to approbate and reprobate; (ii) that the other party would not suffer prejudice which is irreversible, due to withdrawal of the consent. If this twin requirement is not satisfied, the Court should be loath to entertain the prayer to allow the party to unilaterally withdraw his/her consent. 17. Reverting to the facts of the present case, we are in agreement with the finding recorded by the Trial Court that the sole reason or justification given by the appellant husband for withdrawing his consent already given (that he was denied access of the children), is not substantiated by him. Whereas, the material on record would indicate that the real reason was the inability of the appellant husband to meet the children as he was in jail in connection with criminal cases and also because the children were unwilling to meet the appellant. Thus, it was not a case of respondent coming in the way of providing access of the children to the appellant. In other words, there was no sufficient or just cause established by the appellant for permitting him to withdraw his consent. Further, it has come on record that the respondent acted upon the Consent Terms dated 6th October, 2008 and performed her obligations and committed herself to waive the claim of maintenance for herself and also streedhan including to withdraw civil and criminal actions initiated by her against the appellant. Even for this reason, the appellant cannot be permitted to withdraw his consent as it would result in bestowing premium on the appellant inspite of his unjust and inequitable request to allow him to of unilaterally withdraw the consent. We are in agreement with the said conclusion reached by the Family Court. 18. In this view of the matter, the rejection of the application preferred by the appellant for withdrawal of his consent was inevitable; and at the same time, the Court was duty bound to dissolve the marriage between the parties and pass a decree of divorce by mutual consent on the basis of the Consent Terms already filed on record accompanied by a formal application/Petition filed by the parties to grant such decree. The Family Court has also adverted to Rule 31 of the Family Courts (Maharashtra) Rules, 1987. The same reads thus: \u201c31. Settlement before Counsellor : \u2013 When the parties arrive at a settlement before the Counsellor relating to the dispute or any part thereof, such settlement shall be reduced to writing and shall be signed by the parties and countersigned by the Counsellor. The Court shall pronounce a decree or order in terms thereof unless the Court considers the terms of the settlement unconscionable or unlawful or contrary to public policy.\u201d 19. Notably, these Rules have been framed by the High Court in exercise of power bestowed in Section 21 of the Family Courts Act, 1984. In terms of Section 21(2)(c) of the Act, Rules can be framed to deal with the subject of efforts to be made by the Family Court and the procedure to be followed for assisting and persuading parties to arrive at a settlement. Rule 31, inter-alia, deals with that subject. In terms of this Rule, therefore, the Court may pronounce a decree on the basis of the consent terms reduced into writing and signed by the parties, unless it were to be of the opinion that the terms of the settlement arrived at between the parties are unconscionable or unlawful or contrary to the public policy. None of these issues have been raised by the appellant. We, however, make it clear that Rule 31 will be of no avail to pass a decree on the basis of petition such as for relief under Section 13 of the Act of 1955, as those petitions cannot be decreed merely because it is not defended or that parties have consented for passing decree on the ground pleaded therein. We have already alluded to this aspect hitherto. 20. For the view that we have taken, we find no infirmity in the order passed by the Family Court in rejecting the application (Exhibit 80) preferred by the appellant and instead, having decreed the Petition by dissolving the marriage solemnized between the appellant and the respondent and granting decree of divorce by mutual consent on the basis of the terms specified in Consent Terms (Exhibit 71). 21. We, reserve the remedy of the parties to resort to appropriate proceedings for effectuating the terms agreed upon including regarding access of children as provided in the Consent Terms (Exhibit 71), which proceedings will have to be decided on its own merits in accordance with law. All questions in that behalf are left open.22 FCA.61.10 22. Hence, this Appeal ought to fail. The Appeal is, therefore, dismissed with costs quantified at Rs.20,000/- (Rupees Twenty Thousand) to be paid to the respondent within four weeks from today. (MRS.MRIDULA BHATKAR, J.)

She is from AP.   1st week was gone normal, 2nd week started bad days to me. During this period 2nd Week, she use to always complain about her health issues: no hunger, Vomiting, Head ache, body pains, with low BP. When asked about how long ur suffering this problem, she use to avoid & say its just a ladies\u2019 problems. After 3rd week, she had an urine infection, proteins++ are going in Urine (symptoms- mild fever). As a husband I did all sort of investigations, i asked her mother any past history whether she is suffering from kidney disease, she told nothing before marriage normal, after discharge she went her home town, in between MAY to DEC 2017, again she admitted 4 times hospital abdomen pai,, i went her home town checked her healthy condition, she become lean 46 kg to 35 kgs, l was shocking. Finally, i decided to check her Ct scan in HYD and after that we come to know that she is suffering from kidney disease : Membrane nephropathy chronic (Autoimmune Disease) LUPUS and Liver disease which is CHRONIC.      I have reports with me after marriage, Doctor clearly states that she has this ailment from past many years. When Me and my brother started questioning her and her parents they replied don\u2019t know thing, after marriage she got all problems.      Although I have all her reports of joining and discharge. she and her parents are not accepting the fact that she has this kidney disease and liver disease. Her mother has cunningly avoided this topic, I stayed with her hardly 10 to 12 days only. I have taken opinion of 3 specialists, who say that a short episode of urine infection which has happened only once after marriage can\u2019t damage her kidneys to this extent. Before marriage she or her parents has not revealed me about her kidney problem and liver disease. I have become a victim of a well-planned cheating. I want to file 12 C annulment/divorce and cheating case based on all the medical proofs I have. Can I get a divorce on this ground? Recently again checked her medical test proteins++ are going in Urine, and she using steroids Wysolne and other drugs mycopholate.",

The relevant law is follows. You will get divorce without alimony since they cheated you by not disclosing acute diseases. ====================================================================================== What Is Annulment of Marriage In strict Legal terminology, annulment refers only to making a voidable marriage null; if the marriage is void ab initio, then it is automatically null, although a legal declaration of nullity is required to establish this. Annulment is a legal procedure for declaring a marriage null and void. With the exception of bigamy and not meeting the minimum age requirement for marriage, it is rarely granted. A marriage can be declared null and void if certain legal requirements were not met at the time of the marriage. If these legal requirements were not met then the marriage is considered to have never existed in the eyes of the law. This process is called annulment. It is very different from divorce in that while a divorce dissolves a marriage that has existed, a marriage that is annulled never existed at all. Thus unlike divorce, it is retroactive: an annulled marriage is considered never to have existed. Grounds for Annulment The grounds for a marriage annulment may vary according to the different legal jurisdictions, but are generally limited to fraud, bigamy, blood relationship and mental incompetence including the following: 1) Either spouse was already married to someone else at the time of the marriage in question; 2) Either spouse was too young to be married, or too young without required court or parental consent. (In some cases, such a marriage is still valid if it continues well beyond the younger spouse's reaching marriageable age); 3) Either spouse was under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the marriage; 4) Either spouse was mentally incompetent at the time of the marriage;  5) If the consent to the marriage was based on fraud or force;  6) Either spouse was physically incapable to be married (typically, chronically unable to have sexual intercourse) at the time of the marriage; 7) The marriage is prohibited by law due to the relationship between the parties. This is the \"prohibited degree of consanguinity\", or blood relationship between the parties. The most common legal relationship is 2nd cousins; the legality of such relationship between 1st cousins varies around the world. 8) Prisoners sentenced to a term of life imprisonment may not marry. 9) Concealment (e.g. one of the parties concealed a drug addiction, prior criminal record or having a sexually transmitted disease)."

My grandfather have 3 children- two sons and one daughter(younger). elder son has daughter and son. and the next son have two daughters.    Before my grandmother died, this property was registered to have three heirs the two sons and one share for my grandmother. This is documented and it happened only after the daughter agreed she doesn't need a share.    Now my grandmother expired and her elder son also expired. Now the daughter is claiming her share and don't want us to sell it for outsiders. She wants to buy it after deducting her share.    I have contacted lawyers and got this information that since it is on three persons names, my father, my uncle and my grandmother, only the share of my grandmother goes equally to all her children, including the daughter. So in this case the daughter gets only 1/9th of the share of the property.    Can someone clarify on this according to law?      Thanks for the help.",

                "response-text": "Dear Madam, Yes, this was made possible by the amendment of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 which originally didn\u2019t give daughters equal rights to ancestral property. The government amended the law and removed the disparity on September 9, 2005 and established that now a daughter also would acquire ownership rights on the property from the time of her conception. Thus, daughter has been made coparcener like sons and now she has the same rights of partition and power to deal with the property as she pleases. Like any coparcener she can seek a partition and sale of the family home as well as long as these are ancestral properties or joint family properties.   Now, daughter becomes a coparcener in a Hindu Coparcenary and has the same rights in the Coparcenary property as she would have had if she had been a son. However, whereas the amendment vested her with the right on the ancestral property, it also asks her to fulfill the obligations as it puts similar liabilities that it puts to sons.   The Amendment has retrospective effect The established law is that the amended section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act applies to daughters born prior to June 17, 1956 or thereafter (between June 17, 1956 and September 8, 2005), provided they are alive on September 9, 2005, that is on the date when the amendment act of 2005 came into force. Thus, section 6 of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 which was amended by the Amendment Act of 2005 has retroactive effect and do not and cannot impinge upon or curtail or restrict the rights of daughters born prior to 9 September 2005. Now, there is a complete parity in terms of rights and there is no disparity between son and daughter when it comes to inheritance in ancestral property.   What are the legal rights of a married daughter over ancestral property seven years after her parents\u2019 death?\u2019 The Hindu Succession Act, 1956, was amended in 2005 to give daughters an equal share in parental property. In case of ancestral property, a daughter now has a share in it by virtue of birth, while self-acquired property is distributed as per the provisions of the will. If the father passes away without a will, she has the same rights as the son in both ancestral and self-acquired property.The marital status of the daughter is immaterial, and a married daughter has the same rights as an unmarried one. However, it is important to note that if the father died before 2005, a married daughter will not have any right over ancestral property, while the self-acquired property will be distributed as per the will. So, if your father died before 2005, you will have no right over ancestral property, but if he died after 2005, you have a legal claim over it. Moreover, the legal right of inheritance never dies, irrespective of the time elapsed. So, as a legal heir, you can file a suit in the court to enforce your right to the property even after seven years of your parents\u2019 death."

Or you may approach the High Court by filing a writ seeking stay of auction proceedings.  This must be your priority since the bank will not stop the auction until you get an order from a competent court. 2) File a criminal complaint before a magistrate u/s 420, 467, 468, 471 IPC or register an FIR directly at the local police station against the person who forged your father's signatures. The investigation in the matter will take some time and after conclusion of the same the charge sheet will be filed before the competent court. After that the trial will start. Hence you must stop the bank first from auctioning the property, so that you may not loose possession. Otherwise third party rights will be crested and it will become very difficult to get hold of the property again. Contact a local lawyer immediately to proceed in the matter. Regards, Nishant"

                "response-text": "Dear Madam, It is better to wait for one year and after completion of judicial separation you can get divorce very easily. The law is as follows. ======================================================================================= Marriage is one of the most important social institutions of human society. Marriages are decided in heaven and arranged on earth. It is a solemn practice which involves two individuals. But sometimes two people fail to coordinate with one another which might lead to adverse circumstances. According to Hindu marriage act 1955 section 13 part 1 either party can apply for a decree of divorce on the grounds specified in the section A wife has additional rights to apply for dissolution of marriage under section 13 part 2.Judicial separation is quite different from divorce. While in divorce all the rights and duties of a couple towards one another come to an end. In judicial separation only cohabitation ends other rights and duties still exist. A couple is free to reside under different roof after judicial separation but still has certain rights and duties. Sometimes a person needs to give time and space to themselves and their spouse. This can help in self realisation, self analysis and also understand the value of the partner. Inferring and judging the faults of oneself is a big step towards a sunny future. While in judicial separation there is the option to reconcile and restart things , once divorced the whole marriage is over and remarrying is the only option(marriage has to be solemnized again with the same person) A very major issue that comes to forefront when filling divorce is custody of child/children. Applying for custody is again a long battle which has to be fought with whole mind, body and soul. If a couple is judicially separated both have equal rights upon the kids. A judicially separated wife has similar property rights as a married wife. Once divorced the spouse looses all the rights upon each other and their belongings. All the conjugal rights (matrimonial rights between a husband and a wife) exists during the subsistence of judicial separation. If a spouse dies during the period of judicial separation the other inherits the property provided there is no will. There can be a situation when both the partners in the marriage have reached the highest hierarchy of Maslow\u2019s triangle (Abraham Maslow\u2019s theory of self actualization) and are seeking for legal separation .Alimony, maintenance and remarrying are not their priorities. Such couples can seek judicial separation and let the kids be out of this separation battle. This is the most interesting reason amongst all. If you are well aware about your partner\u2019s chakkar you can apply for judicial separation and if the spouse remarries he/she can be charged under bigamy which might give a lot of benefits to the other partner (provided your partner is so eager to remarry) It is a common practice in glitzy world of bollywood to tie the knot and part ways. But a few of them have proved this notion wrong .Hritik and Susanne who recently planned to split up have kept their slate clean off all sorts of controversy. They are judicially separated but haven\u2019t filed for divorce as yet .Anurag Kashyap and Kalki Koechin, due to their mutual problems have decided to take some time off from each other and resolve their issues Divorce is permanently dissolving the marriage while judicial separation is temporarily barring it. Divorce puts an end to a relationship forever. The answer to cruelty, violence, torture, mental turmoil is divorce and one should not refrain from ending such an abusive relationship. Judicial separation is like giving a second chance to your better half. Every person should the love blessings in their lives and maybe it\u2019s worth more than ending the relationship without giving it another attempt to workout. As we all know it each person in our life is either a blessing or a lesson\u2026what are you for your partner\u2026.? ========================================================================================= Dear Madam,   You will get judicial separation. The procedure is as follows. The alimony formala is given at the end.  =======================================================================================   AdvocateKhoj\t\t\t  Login : Advocate | Client Special Marriage Act, 1954 23. Judicial separation (1) A petition for judicial separation may be presented to the district court either by the husband or the wife,-   (a) on any of the grounds specified 17[in sub-section (1) 18[and sub-section (1A) of section 27] on which a petition for divorce might have been presented; or   (b) on the ground of failure to comply with a decree for restitution of conjugal rights; and the court, on being satisfied of he truth of the statement made in such petition, and that there is no legal ground why the application should not be granted, may decree judicial separation accordingly.   (2) Where the court grants a decree for judicial separation, it shall be no longer obligatory for the petitioner to cohabit with the respondent, but the court may, on the application by petition of either party and on being satisfied of the truth of the statements made in such petition, rescind the decree if it considers it just and reasonable to do so. ==================================================================================== Judicial Separation and Divorce in India as per Hindu Marriage Act Judicial separation is a sort of a last resort before the actual legal break up of marriage i.e. divorce. The reason for the presence of such a provision under Hindu Marriage Act is the anxiety of the legislature that the tensions and wear and tear of every day life and the strain of living together do not result in abrupt break \u2013 up of a marital relationship. There is no effect of a decree for judicial separation on the subsistence and continuance of the legal relationship of marriage as such between the parties. The effect however is on their co-habitation. Once a decree for judicial separation is passed, a husband or a wife, whosoever has approached the court, is under no obligation to live with his / her spouse . The provision for judicial separation is contained in section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The section reads as under: A decree for judicial separation can be sought on all those ground on which decree for dissolution of marriage, i.e. divorce can be sought. Hence, judicial separation can be had on any of the following grounds: Adultery Cruelty Desertion Apostacy (Conversion of religion) Insanity Virulent and incurable form of leprosy Venereal disease in a communicable form Renunciation of world by entering any religious order Has not been heard of as being alive for seven years If the person applying for judicial separation is the wife, then the following grounds are also available to her: Remarriage or earlier marriage of the husband but solemnised before the commencement of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, provided the other wife is alive at the time of presentation of petition for judicial separation by the petitioner wife. Rape, sodomy or bestiality by the husband committed after the solemnization of his marriage with the petitioner. Non-resumption of co-habitation between the parties till at least one year after an award of maintenance was made by any court against the husband and in favour of the petitioner wife. Solemnization of the petitioner wife\u2019s marriage with the respondent husband before she had attained the age of 15 years provided she had repudiated the marriage on attaining the age of 15 years but before attaining the age of 18 years.   It is on all the above grounds that judicial separation can be sought. The first 9 grounds are available to both the husband and the wife but the last four grounds are available only to the wife. It is to be noted that it is on these grounds that divorce is also to be granted. It has been held that unless a case for divorce is made out, the question of granting judicial separation does not arise. Therefore, the Courts while dealing with the applications for judicial separation shall bear in mind the specific grounds raised for grant of relief claimed and insist on strict proof to establish those grounds and shall not grant some relief or the other as a matter of course. Thus on a petition for divorce, the Court has discretion in respect of the grounds for divorce other than those mentioned in section 13 (1A) and also some other grounds to grant restricted relief of judicial separation instead of divorce straightway if it is just having regard to the facts and circumstances. Another question that arises is of decree of maintenance vis-\u00e0-vis decree for judicial separation. Where a decree for judicial separation was obtained by the husband against her wife who had deserted him, the wife not being of unchaste character nor her conduct being flagrantly vicious, the order of alimony made in favour of the wife was not interfered with by the Court. ILR (1964) 2 Punj 732.  The Punjab and Haryana High Court has also held that a reading of sec 24 and 26 (maintenance) does not show that if a petition under section 9, 10 12 or 13 is disposed of, the jurisdiction of the court to award maintenance pendent lite by an order to be passed is taken away. AIR 1981 Punj 305 ; 1981 Hindu LR 345 The above decisions go on to show that even where a decree for judicial separation is passed in favour of the husband, maintenance may still be awarded to a wife and judicial separation is no defence to a claim for maintenance under Hindu Marriage Act. Though section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act does not provide any time as to how long judicial separation can last. But section 13 of the Act provides that if there is no resumption of co-habitation between the parties one year after the decree for judicial separation is passed, the parties can get a decree for divorce on this ground itself. But divorce on this ground will be given only when one year has expired after the passing of the decree for judicial separation and not earlier. The reason for this is that one year is a long period and it provides sufficient time to the parties for reconciliation or to arrive at a decision. If the parties fail to overcome their differences within this period, then there is no fun in allowing the legality of the marriage to just linger on when in substance the relationship of marriage has long expired. It is to be noted, however, that if the parties do agree to resume co-habitation any time after the passing of the decree for judicial separation, they can get the decree rescinded by applying to the court. The Act does not refer to any specific grounds on which a decree for judicial separation can be annulled or rescinded. Section 10(2) however, empowers the Court to rescind the decree for judicial separation if it considers it just and reasonable to do so. However Courts have repeatedly warned that this power of rescission has to be exercised with great circumspection and not in a hurry and only after satisfying themselves that it would be just and reasonable to allow such rescission."

Apart from the above, your brother may file an information cum complaint (non-Actionable) before the Police commissioner and SHO of the area and mention all the cruelty committed by her upon him. that document/information cum complaint shall be beneficial for all of you in the future in case she filed the case against your brother and parents.   One more thing as you informed that your parents are residing with you so, if she filed the domestic violence case against them then your brother or parents may raise the objections that they are residing separately hence there is no domestic relationship now, hence the domestic violence case is not made out against your parents.   Apart from the above, if suppose she filed the domestic violence case against your parents then also she cannot get anything from them, as in the Domestic violence case, she will claim protection order, right to residence, monetary relief, child custody and compensation under section 18,19,20,21 & 22 of The Protection of Women From Domestic Violence Act-2005. so as per the Act, if she claims protection, then the court asked that when the parents are already residing separately then there is no question of torture or harassment or violence, so her prayer of this relief will be rejected in respect of your parents. Secondly, She claims residence Order, Monetary Relief, Child Custody, and Compensation, so all the reliefs are related to your brother and your parents have no concern with those reliefs except the property in which she resides is your parent's property.   In Domestic Violence case, there is no jail or arresting so there is no question of fear. this is a completely civil nature case, so no Need to Worry, be happy, be safe, and stay at home.

Section 112 of the Customs Act provides for penalty for improper importation and Section 114 of the Customs Act provides for penalty for attempt to export goods improperly. In respect of prohibited goods the Adjudicating Officer may impose penalty upto five times the value of the goods. It is, therefore, absolutely necessary for the trade to know what are the prohibitions or restrictions in force before they contemplate to import or export any goods.  The terms \"Prohibited Goods\" have been defined in sub-section 33 of Section 2 of the Customs Act as meaning \"any goods the import or export of which is subject to any prohibition under the Customs Act or any other law for the time being in force\". Under section 11 of the Customs Act, the Central Government has the power to issue Notification under which export or import of any goods can be declared as prohibited. The prohibition can either be absolute or conditional. The specified purposes for which a notification under section 11 can be issued are maintenance of the security of India, prevention and shortage of goods in the country, conservation of Foreign Exchange, safeguarding balance of payments etc. The Central Govt. has issued many notifications to prohibit import of sensitive goods such as coins, obscene books, printed waste paper containing pages of any holy books, armored guard, fictitious stamps, explosives, narcotic drugs, rock salt, saccharine, etc. Under Export and Import Policy, laid down by the DGFT, in the Ministry of Commerce, certain goods are placed under restricted categories for import and export. Under section 3 and 5 of the Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act, 1992, the Central Government can make provisions for prohibiting, restricting or otherwise regulating the import of export of the goods. As for example, import of second hand goods and second hand capital goods is restricted. Some of the goods are absolutely prohibited for import and export whereas some goods can be imported or exported against a licence. For example export of human skeleton is absolutely prohibited whereas export of cattle is allowed against an export licence. Another example is provided by Notification No.44(RE-2000) 1997 dated 24.11.2000 in terms of which all packaged products which are subject to provisions of the Standards of Weights and Measures (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 1997, when produced/packed/sold in domestic market, shall be subject to compliance of all the provisions of the said Rules, when imported into India. All packaged commodities imported into India shall carry the name and address of the importer, net quantity in terms of standard unit of weights measures, month and year of packing and maximum retail sale price including other taxes, local or otherwise. In case any of the conditions is not fulfilled, the import of packaged products shall be held as prohibited, rendering such goods liable to confiscation. Another restriction under the aforesaid Notification issued by the Ministry of Commerce is that the import of a large number of products, presently numbering 133, are required to comply with the mandatory Indian Quality Standards (IQS) and for this purpose exporters of these products to India are required to register themselves with Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). Non-fulfillment of the above requirement shall render such goods prohibited for import. Import and export of some specified goods may be restricted/prohibited under other laws such as Environment Protection Act, Wild Life Act, Indian Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, Arms Act, etc. Prohibition under those acts will also apply to the penal provisions of the Customs Act, rendering such goods liable to confiscation under section 111(d) of the Customs Act (for import) and 113 (d) of the Customs Act (for export). Any Importer or Exporter for being knowingly concerned in any fraudulent evasion or attempted evasion of any prohibition under the Customs Act or any other law for the time being in force in respect to any import or export of goods, shall be liable to punishment with imprisonment for a maximum term of three years (seven years in respect of notified goods) under section 135 of the Customs Act. Any person who is reasonably believed to be guilty of an offence, punishable under section 135, may be arrested under the provisions of section 104 of the Customs Act. Keeping in view the above penal provisions in the Customs Act to deal with any deliberate evasion of prohibition/restriction of import of export of specified goods, it is advisable for the Trade to be well conversant with the provisions of EXIM Policy, the Customs Act, as also other allied Acts. They must make sure that before any imports are effected or export planned, they are aware of any prohibition/restrictions and requirements subject to which alone goods can be imported/exported, so that they do not get penalised and goods do not get involved in confiscation etc. proceedings at the hands of Customs authorities."

V. Sirpurkar with Mr. Nazbile, Counsel for Respondent No.1 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Coram: A.P. Bhangale, J    Dated : 9th August 2011  ORAL JUDGMENT:   1. Heard Mr. Rajnish Vyas, learned Advocate for the Petitioner and Mr. S. V. Sirpurkar, learned Advocate for the Respondent No.1. 2. Rule, made returnable forthwith. Heard by consent of the parties. 3. The petitioner questioned the order dated 07/10/2009 passed by learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Pombhurna in Misc. Criminal Application No. 17/2008, as also order dated 09/08/2010 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Chandrapur in Criminal Appeal No. 132/2009. 4. It is the case of the petitioner that he had married with respondent no. 1 namely Gangubai about 19 years back, she resided with him for 3 years at Rajura, District Chandrapur and, then left matrimonial home and started residing with her parents. Respondent No. 2 is son of the petitioner, who according to the petitioner, has already attained the age of majority i.e. 18 years and is not entitled for the maintenance. The petitioner is facing proceedings initiated under Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (Act 43 of 2005), which was registered as Criminal Application No. 17/2008, in the Court of Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Pombhurna, District Chandrapur. Sau. Gangubai and her son Prashant, had claimed maintenance at the rate of Rs. 5,000/- per month to the applicant no. 1 - Gangubai and Rs. 5,000/- per month to the applicant no. 2 - Prashant i.e. son of the petitioner, who was aged about 16 years when the application was filed. It is further prayed that petitioner shall provide rented house to his wife and son and, to pay costs of litigation. 5. The petitioner had objected grant of relief by filing a reply to the application disputing the allegations made against him regarding the alleged addiction of liquor, cruel treatment, late night coming, assault etc. He also denied that he drove her out of the matrimonial home as alleged in the year 1994 or about. 6. It appears case of the respondent Gangubai that she had sent notice dated 11/07/2008, by R.P.A.D., demanding amount of maintenance to which reply dated 29/07/2008 was sent by the petitioner (as claimed by him). Under these circumstances, the respondent had claimed maintenance by alleging that they were ill- treated, petitioner had assaulted his wife under the influence of the liquor and driven her out of the house with warning not to return. It is also contention of the respondent that the applicant had married with one Shobha 26-27 years ago, out of that wedlock, he had two daughters namely Vaishali and Vanmala. According to the petitioner, respondent no. 1 is also married with one Shamrao Tajne. 7. Considering all these contentions and counter contentions, the application preferred under Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 was allowed partly with direction against the petitioner requiring him to pay maintenance in the sum of Rs. 1,000/- to Gangubai and sum of Rs. 500/- to his son namely Prashant, with further direction to arrange for rental accommodation for residence of Gangubai and her son Prashant and, Rs. 500/- towards cost of litigation. The aforesaid order dated 07/10/2009, by learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Pombhurna was carried in Appeal before the learned Sessions Judge, Chandrapur, which came to be dismissed by reasoned Judgment and Order, which petitioner has impugned herein. 8. The main contention of the petitioner is that the application under Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 was inordinately delayed and there was no reasonable explanation for the delay and, secondly, that petitioner is not liable to pay maintenance particularly to the son who is already attained age of majority. According to the learned Advocate for the petitioner, since the alleged desertion by the petitioner, Gangubai and her son have resided separately for more than 12 years and, therefore, they are not entitled to claim amount of maintenance. It is further submitted that the impugned Judgment and Order by the Court be quashed. 9. Learned Advocate for the respondent submitted that there is no question of limitation as submitted by the learned Advocate for the petitioner as there is continuous cause of action for a wife to claim maintenance and avail of residence and protection orders under the Domestic Violence Act. He submitted that the respondent no. 2 was aged about 16 years when application was filed and he being unable to maintain himself, is entitled to maintenance. 10. The contention as to whether the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 is retrospective needs to be considered in the light of settled legal position in this regard. It is true that Penal Statute which creates new offence or introduce an increased penalty will be prospective by reason of the Constitutional restriction imposed by Article 20 of the Constitution of India. The question as to whether the provisions of Domestic Violence Act has a retrospective effect or not is already answered by reasoned Judgment of this Court, in Criminal Writ Petition No. 252/2011. 11. The Apex Court in the case of Vanka Radhamanohari vs. Vanka Venkata Reddy [1993 (3) SCC 4], while considering bar of limitation for taking cognizance of offence as also prayer for condonation of delay, considered matrimonial offences as exceptional causes wherein the Court would not throw out the complaint solely on the ground of delay. In view of the Section 473 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Court can take cognizance of an offence not only when it is satisfied on the facts and circumstances of the case that the delay has been properly explained or but also when that is necessary so to do in the interests of justice. Section 473 has non obstante clause which means that the said section has overriding effect over Section 468 if the Court is satisfied in the facts and circumstances of the particular case that either the delay has been properly explained or that it is necessary so to condone it in the interest of justice. Thus, in respect of matrimonial offences when allegations are of cruelty, torture, assault by the husband or members of the family to the complainant, a Court will consider that it is a matter of common experience that the victim who is subjected to a such acts of cruelty repeatedly is more or less suffering from continuing offence it is only as a last resort that wife would approach the Court to unfold the day- to-day torture and cruelty forced upon her inside the house, as most of the victims are reluctant to make their grievances public. 12. The protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 came into force on 26/10/2006 vide S.O. 1776(E), dated 17/10/2006. The Act was brought into force to provide for more effective protection to the rights of women guaranteed under the Constitution of India who are victims of violence of any kind occurring within the family and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. Thus, any women who or has been in a Domestic relationship who is subjected to Domestic Violence by the respondent i.e. her husband, she can apply under Section 12 of the Act as an \"aggrieved person\" complainant of Domestic Violence and seek orders under the Act i.e. maintenance, protection orders etc. Thus, the respondent in such application pursuant to the complaint under the Domestic Violence Act, cannot be allowed to defeat the provisions of Act by continuously depriving his wife or applicant with whom he was in the Domestic relationship from the benefits under the Act i.e. shared household, maintenance, monetary benefits in this regard. There shall be continuing causes of action, therefore, there is no question of putting a stop to the relief sought for on the ground of continuous breach of legal right, since the continued deprivation of economic or Financial resources and continued prohibition or denial of access for the shared household, maintenance etc. to the aggrieved person can come within definition of \"Domestic Violence\" explained in Chapter II of the Act. Protection under the Act becomes available to the wife/applicant, who was driven out from her husband's shared household prior to coming into effect of the Act of 2005, but if the deprivation continued even after the Act came into force. Thus, as held by this Court in Smt Bharati Naik Vs. Shri Ravi Ramnath Halnarkar reported in 2011 ALL MR (Cri) 224, with reference to the Act of 2005, an interpretation which furthers the purpose of the Act must be preferred to the one which obstructs the object and paralyses the purpose of the Act. Thus, even if the Woman was in the past in relationship, she would be entitled to invoke the provisions of the Act on the basis of continuing cause of action. 13. Perusal of Section 26 of the Domestic Violence Act, indicate that relief under the Act is in addition to the relief which may be available in any legal proceeding before Civil Court, Family Court or Criminal Court affecting the aggrieved person and the respondent. Section 12 which require application before the Magistrate for obtaining order or reliefs under the Act contains proviso to the effect that before passing any order on such application, the magistrate shall take into consideration any Domestic incident report received by him from the Protection Officer or the service provider. The word 'any' in the proviso would indicate that if such report is received, if any, because before receiving such report it is essential that for the area concerned State Government must have appointed Protection Officer. In view of the Section 7 of the act and such appointment must be notified in the area for which such Protection Officer shall exercise powers and perform the duties in accordance with the Act, while service provider is required to register himself under Section 10 of the Act. In the absence of notification of a Protection Officer or registered Service Provider, it may not be possible for Magistrate to receive Domestic Incident Report before disposing of application made by the aggrieved person under Section 12 of the Act. This question was dealt with by Karnataka High Court in the ruling of Narayankumar Vs. State of Karnataka & Anr reported in 2010 ALL MR (Cri) Journal 158 wherein it is observed that thus; \"In other words if there is a Domestic Incident Report that is received by the Magistrate either from the Protection Officer or from the Provider, then it becomes obligatory on the part of the Magistrate to take note of the said Domestic Incident Report before passing an order on the application filed by the aggrieved party. Therefore, the Section does not say that in every case an aggrieved person is bound to go before either the Protection Officer or the Provider. On the other hand, the scheme of the act make it clear that it is left to the choice of the aggrieved person to go before the Service Provider or the Protection Officer or to approach to the Magistrate under Section 12 of the Act.\" Under these circumstances, it appears that an aggrieved person is not necessarily required to approach the Service Provider or the Protection Officer. It is left to the choice of the aggrieved person to approach the Magistrate with an application under Section 12 of the Act. Therefore, one cannot say the Magistrate must wait for notification for appointment of the Protection Officer for the area or registration of Service Provider before disposing of the application under Section 12 of the Act filed by an aggrieved person. When aggrieved person has chosen to approach the Magistrate directly as observed by the Karnataka High Court that the proviso Section 12 makes it clear that the Magistrate shall have to take in to account any incident report received by him before passing any order of the application filed by the aggrieved person. In other words, if there is a Domestic Incident Report that is received by the Magistrate either from the Protection Officer or from the Service Provider then only it is obligatory for the Magistrate to take note of the same before passing final order of the application made by the aggrieved person. 14. For all these reasons, the orders passed by the Courts below do not require any interference and hence petition is dismissed. JUDGE Punde"

The Non-compete clause finds place under the agreements and contracts throughout the globe. When we see the Indian legal scenario about the non compete clause, it is prohibited under the Law of Contracts. Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act-1872 provides that \u201dEvery agreement by which anyone is restrained from exercising a lawful profession or trade or business of any kind, is to that extent void\u201d   Indian law is therefore very clear and strict on this point, any such non compete agreement shall not be binding on the parties and the same shall be null and void. By using the term void ab initio, for such type of agreements it has shown that it has kept such non compete clause in the agreements beyond consideration. Indian courts have also consistently refused to enforce post termination non compete clauses in employment contracts as \u201crestraint of trade\u201d is impermissible under section 27 of the Indian Contract Act-1872, and have held them as void and against the public policy because of their potential to deprive an individual of his or her fundamental right to earn a living."

It is your own statement that age of your sister was 20 years at the time of birth of her son, so she also cannot allege that she had not attained the age of consent when the sexual act was performed with her. 2.

Is he agreeing with her to take action on the person who raped his wife very long ago which resulted into this child? As per your contents you sister got married to her husband at the age of 15 years and when she was 20 years of age ( i.e., after her marriage) she was raped by the biological  father of her son which even her husband is not knowing nor he ever questioned about her pregnancy when he did not indulge into any sexual relationship with his wife. When you approach police they will drill with more such questions which you may not be able to anser because this appears to be a drama created for some purpose at this stage. However by DNA test she can prove the maternity of the child but she has to file a case against him before the court which in turn would allow to carry out such test to prove the paternity of the child."

UOI & Ors.(OA-3312/2009) wherein it was held that there has to be nexus between allegation in criminal case and official duty of concerned employee in the absence of which there may be no justification to carry on departmental proceedings against employee. Para 9 of the said judgment read as under:- 9. I find that this Tribunal in OA-2411/2007 has as recently as on 19.12.2008. I the case of Jogeshwar Mahanta Vs. UOI relating to matrimonial discard, in which the applicant had been proceeded under Rule 14 of the CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965 by issue of chargesheet on the basis of allegations made by the wife, decided that there has to be a nexus with official duty and whereas the applicant may be still embroiled in matrimonial dispute with his wife, them would be no justification to carry on with the departmental proceedings against him. The charge memo was therefore quashed and the application was allowed. 4.\tIn the case of I.Yesudanam OA-2281/2009 it was held that the leave encashment and other retirement benefits could not be withheld on the ground of pendency of judicial proceedings. In the said case this Tribunal viewed that even during pendency of judicial proceedings, Govt. servant is entitled to release of leave encashment, CGIES and GPF amount payable to him. Relevant excerpt of the order passed in said case read as under:- 11.\tA perusal of the order passed by the Tribunal in OA-2154/2002, relied upon by the applicant, shows that Sh. J.P. Sharma was suspended on 26.02.2001 under Rule 10(1)(b) of the CCS(CCA) Rules, 1965 and superannuated on 31.03.2002 whereupon a provisional pension in terms of Rule 69 of CCS(Pension) Rules, 1972 was granted to him. He had sought payment of all retiral dues such as gratuity, leave encashment, full pension etc. with interest although he was involved in a case of embezzlement of government money and FIR was filed with respect to offences under Section 120-B, 420, 468, 477-A, IPC and 13(2) r/w 13(1)(c) of P.C. Act, 1988. Having considered the submissions made and provisions of the various Rules the Tribunal found that while no judicial proceedings could be said to have been instituted or deemed to be so, the applicant having been suspended, departmental proceedings would be deemed to have been instituted against him as per Rule (9)(6)(a) of CCS(Pension) Rules, 1972 and therefore on.ly a provisional pension could be paid. Further by reference to Rule 9(4) and 3(o) of the CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972 and keeping in view the judgment of the Apex Court in D.V. Kapoor Vs. UOI and Ors., (1990) 4 SCC 314, the Tribunal noted that use of the term pension was in contradistinction to gratuity, and thus gratuity would be payable. Again by a reference to CCS (Leave) Rules, 1972, particularly Rule 39(3) thereof it was noted that the competent authority could withhold cash equivalent of earned leave in such a case if there was a possibility of some money becoming recoverable on conclusion of the criminal/disciplinary proceedings. It was held that in absence of such satisfaction of the concerned authority having been expressed by an order in writing, the leave encashment could not have been withheld. In this background the applicant was found to be entitled to leave encashment and gratuity and also to provisional pension only."

                "response-text": "In Supreme court case in J.B. Chaudhry vs Indian Overseas Bank & Ors. on 22 August, 2013, it was observed as under: One thing is clear from all the judgments which have been cited on behalf of both the parties that Supreme Court has held that there must be an entitlement in accordance with the statutory rules or rules of the organization which entitle withholding of terminal benefits such as pension or gratuity or other terminal benefits and if rules so provide then enquiry proceedings can be held even after retirement of an employee. I may note that rules, whether the same are statutory or they are non- statutory rules of the organization, will pertain to different heads of payment to be made for different terminal benefits such as pension or gratuity or provident fund or leave encashment and the like. What is required to be emphasized is that whenever an employer-organization seeks to withhold or forfeit any payment under any one particular head of terminal benefits payable to an employee on superannuation, that action qua that head of terminal benefit will have to be justified in accordance with the relevant rules as applicable, whether statutory or otherwise. None of the judgments of the Supreme Court (except the judgment in the case of Jaswant Singh Gill (supra) and which is discussed hereinafter) state that there is disentitlement to withhold or forfeit terminal benefits or to continue with the enquiry even if there does exist, either any statutory rules or rules of the employer- organization for the purpose. The most important aspect to be noted is of distinction between enquiries to impose punishment to an employee and those enquiries to withhold or forfeit certain terminal benefits. While the latter is permitted even after retirement in accordance with the relevant provisions, the former is not permitted vide para 6 of the M.H.Mazumdar's case. In Madras High Court P.Muthusamy vs Tamilnadu Cements on 31 August, 2006, ut was observed: Petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution of India for the issuance of a writ of certiorarified mandamus after calling for the concerned records from the respondents, quash the order of the first respondent dated 30.06.2003 bearing Rc. No.3336/A3/95-1 in so far as it refers to the charge memos dated 16.09.2002 (WP.18592/03) and 15.05.2001 (WP.18593/03) in so far as they mention that the petitioner is being retired without prejudice to the pending disciplinary proceedings and by withholding his terminal benefits as illegal, arbitrary, without any authority, without jurisdiction and contrary to the service regulation of the first respondent Corporation; and consequently direct the 1st respondent to pay the petitioner all the terminal benefits (Gratuity, Provident Fund and Leave Encashment) along with interest at the rate of 24% per annum. Held: Consequently, we hold that the petitioner is entitled to all the terminal benefits and the same have to be disbursed to him within a period of 30 days from the date of receipt of copy of this Order. It is for the first respondent/Corporation to incorporate relevant provisions in their Service Rules as prevailing in all other Service Rules applicable to government servants so that disciplinary proceedings could be continued even after a charged employee is permitted to retire on his attaining the age of superannuation. 9. Both the Writ Petitions are allowed. No costs. Connected Miscellaneous Petitions are closed. Thus you may file a writ of mandamus before high court invoking article 226 of the constitution for relief and remedy."

They are both architects living in Bombay. Two years ago, Divya fell severely ill with an unknown but crippling virus. She has not been able to return to work, so Nitin has been supporting both of them financially by mutual agreement. Divya has been able to take care of their home in this period.   Last October, Nitin decided that he wanted to move back to live with his parents. He has agreed to an arranged marriage to someone else because of family pressure.   Can Divya seek maintenance from Nitin? The case, if taken ahead, would go to trial before the Bombay Trial Court.",

V. Sirpurkar with Mr. Nazbile, Counsel for Respondent No.1 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Coram: A.P. Bhangale, J    Dated : 9th August 2011  ORAL JUDGMENT:   1. Heard Mr. Rajnish Vyas, learned Advocate for the Petitioner and Mr. S. V. Sirpurkar, learned Advocate for the Respondent No.1. 2. Rule, made returnable forthwith. Heard by consent of the parties. 3. The petitioner questioned the order dated 07/10/2009 passed by learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Pombhurna in Misc. Criminal Application No. 17/2008, as also order dated 09/08/2010 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Chandrapur in Criminal Appeal No. 132/2009. 4. It is the case of the petitioner that he had married with respondent no. 1 namely Gangubai about 19 years back, she resided with him for 3 years at Rajura, District Chandrapur and, then left matrimonial home and started residing with her parents. Respondent No. 2 is son of the petitioner, who according to the petitioner, has already attained the age of majority i.e. 18 years and is not entitled for the maintenance. The petitioner is facing proceedings initiated under Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (Act 43 of 2005), which was registered as Criminal Application No. 17/2008, in the Court of Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Pombhurna, District Chandrapur. Sau. Gangubai and her son Prashant, had claimed maintenance at the rate of Rs. 5,000/- per month to the applicant no. 1 - Gangubai and Rs. 5,000/- per month to the applicant no. 2 - Prashant i.e. son of the petitioner, who was aged about 16 years when the application was filed. It is further prayed that petitioner shall provide rented house to his wife and son and, to pay costs of litigation. 5. The petitioner had objected grant of relief by filing a reply to the application disputing the allegations made against him regarding the alleged addiction of liquor, cruel treatment, late night coming, assault etc. He also denied that he drove her out of the matrimonial home as alleged in the year 1994 or about. 6. It appears case of the respondent Gangubai that she had sent notice dated 11/07/2008, by R.P.A.D., demanding amount of maintenance to which reply dated 29/07/2008 was sent by the petitioner (as claimed by him). Under these circumstances, the respondent had claimed maintenance by alleging that they were ill- treated, petitioner had assaulted his wife under the influence of the liquor and driven her out of the house with warning not to return. It is also contention of the respondent that the applicant had married with one Shobha 26-27 years ago, out of that wedlock, he had two daughters namely Vaishali and Vanmala. According to the petitioner, respondent no. 1 is also married with one Shamrao Tajne. 7. Considering all these contentions and counter contentions, the application preferred under Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 was allowed partly with direction against the petitioner requiring him to pay maintenance in the sum of Rs. 1,000/- to Gangubai and sum of Rs. 500/- to his son namely Prashant, with further direction to arrange for rental accommodation for residence of Gangubai and her son Prashant and, Rs. 500/- towards cost of litigation. The aforesaid order dated 07/10/2009, by learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Pombhurna was carried in Appeal before the learned Sessions Judge, Chandrapur, which came to be dismissed by reasoned Judgment and Order, which petitioner has impugned herein. 8. The main contention of the petitioner is that the application under Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 was inordinately delayed and there was no reasonable explanation for the delay and, secondly, that petitioner is not liable to pay maintenance particularly to the son who is already attained age of majority. According to the learned Advocate for the petitioner, since the alleged desertion by the petitioner, Gangubai and her son have resided separately for more than 12 years and, therefore, they are not entitled to claim amount of maintenance. It is further submitted that the impugned Judgment and Order by the Court be quashed. 9. Learned Advocate for the respondent submitted that there is no question of limitation as submitted by the learned Advocate for the petitioner as there is continuous cause of action for a wife to claim maintenance and avail of residence and protection orders under the Domestic Violence Act. He submitted that the respondent no. 2 was aged about 16 years when application was filed and he being unable to maintain himself, is entitled to maintenance. 10. The contention as to whether the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 is retrospective needs to be considered in the light of settled legal position in this regard. It is true that Penal Statute which creates new offence or introduce an increased penalty will be prospective by reason of the Constitutional restriction imposed by Article 20 of the Constitution of India. The question as to whether the provisions of Domestic Violence Act has a retrospective effect or not is already answered by reasoned Judgment of this Court, in Criminal Writ Petition No. 252/2011. 11. The Apex Court in the case of Vanka Radhamanohari vs. Vanka Venkata Reddy [1993 (3) SCC 4], while considering bar of limitation for taking cognizance of offence as also prayer for condonation of delay, considered matrimonial offences as exceptional causes wherein the Court would not throw out the complaint solely on the ground of delay. In view of the Section 473 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Court can take cognizance of an offence not only when it is satisfied on the facts and circumstances of the case that the delay has been properly explained or but also when that is necessary so to do in the interests of justice. Section 473 has non obstante clause which means that the said section has overriding effect over Section 468 if the Court is satisfied in the facts and circumstances of the particular case that either the delay has been properly explained or that it is necessary so to condone it in the interest of justice. Thus, in respect of matrimonial offences when allegations are of cruelty, torture, assault by the husband or members of the family to the complainant, a Court will consider that it is a matter of common experience that the victim who is subjected to a such acts of cruelty repeatedly is more or less suffering from continuing offence it is only as a last resort that wife would approach the Court to unfold the day- to-day torture and cruelty forced upon her inside the house, as most of the victims are reluctant to make their grievances public. 12. The protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 came into force on 26/10/2006 vide S.O. 1776(E), dated 17/10/2006. The Act was brought into force to provide for more effective protection to the rights of women guaranteed under the Constitution of India who are victims of violence of any kind occurring within the family and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. Thus, any women who or has been in a Domestic relationship who is subjected to Domestic Violence by the respondent i.e. her husband, she can apply under Section 12 of the Act as an \"aggrieved person\" complainant of Domestic Violence and seek orders under the Act i.e. maintenance, protection orders etc. Thus, the respondent in such application pursuant to the complaint under the Domestic Violence Act, cannot be allowed to defeat the provisions of Act by continuously depriving his wife or applicant with whom he was in the Domestic relationship from the benefits under the Act i.e. shared household, maintenance, monetary benefits in this regard. There shall be continuing causes of action, therefore, there is no question of putting a stop to the relief sought for on the ground of continuous breach of legal right, since the continued deprivation of economic or Financial resources and continued prohibition or denial of access for the shared household, maintenance etc. to the aggrieved person can come within definition of \"Domestic Violence\" explained in Chapter II of the Act. Protection under the Act becomes available to the wife/applicant, who was driven out from her husband's shared household prior to coming into effect of the Act of 2005, but if the deprivation continued even after the Act came into force. Thus, as held by this Court in Smt Bharati Naik Vs. Shri Ravi Ramnath Halnarkar reported in 2011 ALL MR (Cri) 224, with reference to the Act of 2005, an interpretation which furthers the purpose of the Act must be preferred to the one which obstructs the object and paralyses the purpose of the Act. Thus, even if the Woman was in the past in relationship, she would be entitled to invoke the provisions of the Act on the basis of continuing cause of action. 13. Perusal of Section 26 of the Domestic Violence Act, indicate that relief under the Act is in addition to the relief which may be available in any legal proceeding before Civil Court, Family Court or Criminal Court affecting the aggrieved person and the respondent. Section 12 which require application before the Magistrate for obtaining order or reliefs under the Act contains proviso to the effect that before passing any order on such application, the magistrate shall take into consideration any Domestic incident report received by him from the Protection Officer or the service provider. The word 'any' in the proviso would indicate that if such report is received, if any, because before receiving such report it is essential that for the area concerned State Government must have appointed Protection Officer. In view of the Section 7 of the act and such appointment must be notified in the area for which such Protection Officer shall exercise powers and perform the duties in accordance with the Act, while service provider is required to register himself under Section 10 of the Act. In the absence of notification of a Protection Officer or registered Service Provider, it may not be possible for Magistrate to receive Domestic Incident Report before disposing of application made by the aggrieved person under Section 12 of the Act. This question was dealt with by Karnataka High Court in the ruling of Narayankumar Vs. State of Karnataka & Anr reported in 2010 ALL MR (Cri) Journal 158 wherein it is observed that thus; \"In other words if there is a Domestic Incident Report that is received by the Magistrate either from the Protection Officer or from the Provider, then it becomes obligatory on the part of the Magistrate to take note of the said Domestic Incident Report before passing an order on the application filed by the aggrieved party. Therefore, the Section does not say that in every case an aggrieved person is bound to go before either the Protection Officer or the Provider. On the other hand, the scheme of the act make it clear that it is left to the choice of the aggrieved person to go before the Service Provider or the Protection Officer or to approach to the Magistrate under Section 12 of the Act.\" Under these circumstances, it appears that an aggrieved person is not necessarily required to approach the Service Provider or the Protection Officer. It is left to the choice of the aggrieved person to approach the Magistrate with an application under Section 12 of the Act. Therefore, one cannot say the Magistrate must wait for notification for appointment of the Protection Officer for the area or registration of Service Provider before disposing of the application under Section 12 of the Act filed by an aggrieved person. When aggrieved person has chosen to approach the Magistrate directly as observed by the Karnataka High Court that the proviso Section 12 makes it clear that the Magistrate shall have to take in to account any incident report received by him before passing any order of the application filed by the aggrieved person. In other words, if there is a Domestic Incident Report that is received by the Magistrate either from the Protection Officer or from the Service Provider then only it is obligatory for the Magistrate to take note of the same before passing final order of the application made by the aggrieved person. 14. For all these reasons, the orders passed by the Courts below do not require any interference and hence petition is dismissed. JUDGE Punde"

Father owned residential house number 1514/13 Govind Puri Kalkaji New Delhi -110019 & commercial property number 1520B/15 Govind Puri Kalkaji New Delhi. Mother owned commercial property house number 1520C/15 Govind Puri Kalkaji New Delhi. Both the commercial properties are located on main road called Baba Fateh Singh Marg leading to Okhla Industrial Area. Both parents executed wills in 2008 regarding immovable property. Father bequeathed immovable property to mother. Consequent upon father's demise in 2009, legal heirs mentioned from S.No.2 to 5 above, executed a relinquishment deed in favor of mother.   Mother was in receipt of monthly rental income of Rs.60,000 at the time of father's demise & mother was living in residential house along with Jatinder Singh's family comprising a daughter and a son. None of the other legal heirs lived in the parental residential house as they had moved out long time back. They did have their clothing/almirahs etc in parental house. They were visiting parental house off and on. They always maintained some possession or the other of portions of the parental house.      Jatinder Singh is in possession of entire front portion of property number 1520B/15 where he runs battery business. At the time of father's demise, the joint family had FDs of Rs.25 lakhs & Rs.10 lakhs in savings account. Mother also began receiving father pension in her bank account at Syndicate bank. Mother became hearing impaired after father's demise. It was learnt in Feb 2018 that Jatinder Singh cashed all FDs & savings bank account money of joint family. He said he spent the money on renovation of parental house & he said some money was invested. He and his wife did not provide details of investment. Mother visited Mumbai for a month sometime in 2014. Mother also visited US in 2012-2013 for 8 months. She was called back to India as Jatinder Singh was admitted in hospital with serious condition.

After Feb 2018, there a couple of occasions when Rupinder Kaur & Satnam Singh tried to meet mother & they were prevented from meeting mother by Jatinder Singh and his family. Rajinder Singh asked Jatinder Singh to get mother's passport renewed as he had to reopen mother's immigration case. But his request was declined stating that mother did not want to go to the US. During Rajinder Singh's visit to parental house in Feb 2018, mother had stated that she was beaten by Jatinder Singh and his family & she had told the same thing to Satnam also on previous occasion.

After 4 months, over the phone, she told that she is pregnant and I am the biological father of the child. she also has given false police complaints in many places. Her pregnancy is confirmed. After the childbirth, they are not disclosing any details of the child until now. From the enquiry at the hospital, we got to know that the baby born in 270 days from the marriage date. It seems to be a preplanned marriage to continue her illicit relationship with someone. They have also extracted lots of money from us before the marriage. Their family is also threatening in many ways. I have all the call recordings and report.      1. Can I go for annulment of marriage because she was pregnant during the marriage?

At present land got mutated in my deceased father's name from seller's son through Asst Commissioner's order.       in court, we named lawyer who drafted our registered sale deed as our only witness and initially he agreed and he gave deposition before the court. however, now he is refusing for cross examination without huge payment to him. he is saying if we force him for cross through court, then he will lie on facts and also say to judge that we have coerced him for deposition. I've no other witnesses on my side since we left village long time ago.      I was told that Supreme court has come up with order that if its nominal sale deed then that has to be mentioned in the sale deed, whereas our registered sale deed says absolute sale deed in title and talks of complete ownership transfer.

However it is better for you to receive legal notice and send fitting reply notice stating that Section 27 of Contract act does not allow for such bonds. The law says that the employer is entitled for only the actual amount spent by them on training of employee, if exist is premature. ================================== Is notice period (3 months) legal in India? It can be easily understood that the ambit and scope of section 23 of the Indian contract act 1872, is vast and therefore the applicability of its provisions is subject to scrutiny by the court of the consideration and object of an agreement and the agreement itself. Therefore, in order to bring a case within the purview of section 23, it is necessary to show that the object of the agreement or consideration of the agreement or the agreement itself is unlawful. I'll keep it short and simple:   Either party - employer or employee can terminate the contract by giving sufficient notice or compensating accordingly. In such a case, employer is bound to release the employee without any fuss, assuming that either of the above two conditions are met.   So, if your organization doesn't allow you to buyout the notice period, please feel free to knock on the doors of the Indian judiciary. The following key issues should be highlighted: \u2022\tA 30 to 90-day notice period applies in order to terminate \u2018workmen\u2019 (as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947) \u2013 that is, employees whose role is not primarily supervisory, administrative or managerial) for convenience, with 15 days\u2019 pay due for every year worked. In the case of manufacturing units, plantations and mines with 100 or more workmen, termination for convenience requires prior government approval; in other sectors, it requires only government notification. \u2022\tTermination for cause does not include non-performance \u2013 it includes only behaviour which qualifies as misconduct. \u2022\tThe \u2018last in, first out\u2019 principle requires that the employer first terminate for convenience the last people to join the organisation in the same role. However, this requirement can be contracted out of. When hiring for the same role, workmen who were terminated for convenience should be given the opportunity to re-join the company. \u2022\tState laws generally provide for about 15 days of earned/regular leave a year. Employees also benefit from up to 10 days of sick leave and a possible 10 additional days of \u2018casual leave\u2019. This is generally more than what most organisations would ideally like to provide. \u2022\tMost state laws provide for \u2018casual leave\u2019 \u2013 the employee can opt not to come to work that day without applying for leave in advance. Many organisations find this disruptive. \u2022\tMost state laws restrict women from working at night; if women are to work at night, specific approval must be obtained. This exemption is granted only to limited business sectors (eg, IT sector). Further, the employer must offer door-to-door transport and meet some security-related requirements. \u2022\tMost state laws prescribe overtime for any hours worked beyond 48 hours in a week. However, this is seldom observed. \u2022\tIndian law regulates and in some cases prohibits the use of contract workers. To engage contract workers, the contractor must hold a licence and the employer must be registered as a \u2018principal employer\u2019. \u2022\tNon-compete agreements are not enforceable under Indian law, while non-solicitation clauses can be enforced only in limited ways. \u2022\tWhile the \u2018work for hire\u2019 principle applies under the Indian copyright regime, it does not apply under the Indian patent regime; employees must thus provide formal assignments. \u2022\tIndian laws require employers to maintain a plethora of registers and notices. Compliance with such requirements is difficult and full compliance is rare."

Hence, ONLY if an employee completes 4 years and 190 / 240 days of continuous service in the same establishment, he may be eligible for gratuity as per the Payment of Gratuity Act 1972. As was held in the case of Dalmia Magnesite Corporation vs regional Labour Commissioner Madras if this service is interrupted for reason other than mentioned above it shall be deemed has not been continuous service. Where an employee not being an employee employed in a seasonal establishment is not in continuous service for any period of 1 year, shall be deemed to be in continuous service under the employer if during the period 12 calendar months preceding the date with reference to which calculation is to be made, he has actually worked under the employee for not less than 190 days in the case of an employee employed below ground in a mine or any establishment which work for less than 6 days in a week and 240 days in any other case. Under clause 2 of section 2A when determining the continuous service for any period of 6 months rather then 1 year for Payment of Gratuity, the number of days the employee should have actually work should be half the number of days actually work which constitutes continuous service for a period of 1 year. What this means is if we are calculating gratuity for a period of 6 month rather than 1 years then 190 days will be replaced by 95 days and 240 days will be replaced by 120 days."

[Note: if an employee having been superannuated is re-employed by the employer without any break in service, he will be eligible for payment of service] In case of mine or non-seasonal establishment working for less than SIX days in week, he has actually worked for at least 190 days [in Mine] during the period of TWELVE months or 95 days, during the preceding SIX months, he shall be deemed to have rendered continuous service for a period of ONE year or SIX months, respectively. In a case of any other non-seasonal establishment, he has actually worked for at least 240 days during the preceding 12 months or 120 days during the preceding SIX months, he shall be deemed to have rendered continuous service for a period of ONE year or SIX months, respectively. In a case of a seasonal establishment, he has actually worked for at least 75% of the days on which the establishment was in operation.  For this purpose, an employee shall be deemed to have worked on a day on which:  He has been laid-off under an agreement or in accordance with standing orders; He has been on leave with full wages, earned in the previous year; He has been absent due to temporary disablement caused by accident arising out of, and in the course of his employment, and In the case of a female, she has been on maternity leave not exceeding TWELVE weeks.  In order to explain it better, we have compiled a list of frequently asked questions along with answers. FAQ-1 Natasha joined ABC Limited on 2nd June 2003. She was on maternity leave from 1st September 2006 to 31st March 2007. After delivery of her baby, she decided to take a break for one year. She joined back the company on 1st April 2008. Eventually, she resigned on 15th September 2011. Will she be entitled to Gratuity? Answer: NO, she is not entitled to Gratuity. Even though she joined the company on 2nd June 2003, however, she took a break of ONE year. After re-joining the company on 1st April 2008, she didn't complete the minimum required continuous service of FIVE years and hence not entitled to gratuity. Her second stint with the company will be considered as new employment. In this case, for calculating the eligibility, you must consider the following -  Was she on company roll during her break of one year? Has she been paid during her break?  If and only if, your answer to both questions is yes, then only she will become eligible for gratuity and her gratuity shall be calculated for EIGHT Years. \"As per Madras High Court judgement in a case of Mettur Beardsell Limited [represented by its Personal Manager], Madras v/s Regional Labour Commissioner [Central Authority under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972], Madras, it has been stated that if an employee has rendered continuous service of 240 days in the fifth year of service then for the purpose of calculation of gratuity, it must be considered as if he has completed FIVE years of continuous service.\\\\\\\""

That means if an employee works in the establishment for more than 6 months in a year, he shall be eligible to get gratuity , if the employee has had continuous service of 190 / 240 days. - And further , since completed year of service is basis continuous service, hence for the establishment which working is less than 6 days in a week , rule of 4 years 190 days will be applicable , and for the establishment working 6 days working rule of 240 would be applicable.  - Since, the IT firms operates only 5 days in a week , hence rule of 4 years 190 days will be applicable.

That was never done and the caretaker provider agency informed us that they are instructed not to change him and our views were nullified. I therefore, refrained from paying caretaker salary until meeting will held and our views are considered. Then also those flat owners did not care to communicate and informed us via caretaker provider agency that our payments are not required as the other flat owners themselves will pay and keep him for themselves.

In the last few days they returned the AMC charges for the elevator and again giving notice) stating that they will not take the payment and they will desist us (some of them are senior citizens) and their family and relatives and helps to use the elevator.   It worthwhile mentioning there is no society or declared secretary for this apartment.   some of the flat owners just formed a group among them.      My question :   1.

If your wife has asked for maintenance under CrPC 125, here's your chance to learn everything about how to fight and deny or reduce maintenance under CrPC 125 1. Husband\u2019s EMI towards house to be considered in CrPC 125 Maintenance to wife \u2013 SC Judgment This is somewhat old judgment of Supreme Court, and it brings an important consideration which was overlooked by lower courts: Which was neglecting to consider monthly EMI paid by husband towards housing loan. The order reduced maintenance amount from Rs 10,000 to Rs 5,000 p.m. While this may cause cheers to readers, it should be noted that the in-hand salary of husband is Rs 9,000 p.m, so effectively he has to now survive on Rs 4,000 p.m. Somehow the facts of the case don\u2019t add up for me. There must be more to it than the numbers mentioned in the judgment. The logic of going for an EMI of 21K on a salary of 35K itself seems questionable. Surely reducing maintenance might be considered a sacred goal by many husbands, but taking such huge loan thereby living on the edge is probably not for everyone. Also, from facts of the case, husband has already accumulated huge arrears of maintenance, probably hoping that one day a higher court will reduce his maintenance to some very low amount. While an optimistic view is good in life, one should assess risk vs reward in these matters. Accumulating arrears in maintenance is a high risk thing, because there is no guarantee the higher courts may reduce the maintenance drastically. Further, one has to live with that uncertainty for a long time running around in courts, so best strategy should be to reduce interim maintenance right from the start, at trial court level. 2. MP HC denies maintenance to wife on her CrPC 125 appeal We have this very recent judgment of Madhya Pradesh High Court which denied maintenance to wife under CrPC 125 on her appeal to HC since the court agreed with trial court\u2019s observations that according to evidence led by husband and also wife\u2019s own admissions, it was the wife who was not staying with him out of her own freewill. The judgment is actually not very significant, since both evidence by way of letters of husband and wife\u2019s own admissions proved that there was no maltreatment, and in practical cases such evidence, and wife\u2019s own admissions are very rarely seen. Also the wife didn\u2019t appear in HC at all for her own appeal. If any husband is lucky enough to have this kind of evidence (and a wife who admits in court to her faults ) , of course they can make full use of it! This was how usage of CrPC 125 was intended to be, but after passing of laws like DV Act combined with the so-called \u2018women empowerment\u2019 trend, most of the time interim maintenance is granted based merely on allegations and the fact that wife is not staying with husband. 3. Qualified wife can\u2019t sit idle and claim maintenance: Mumbai family court Important part of judgment below: ________________________________________ 16. The learned counsel for respondent has argued that the petitioner is well qualified and she is earning an amount of Rs.50,000/\u00acper month, she is having sufficient income for her maintenance. It is argued by the learned counsel for respondent that before the police station Worli on 12.11.2011 the petitioner has given statement u/s 161 of Cr.P.C. The petitioner has admitted that she has completed degree in Food and Science Nutrician, she had worked as a dietician, she is Post Graduate in Dietician field, she had also worked with Larcen and Tubro etc. but at present she is not working. The above statement made by the petitioner clearly shows that she is well qualified and able to do job. The respondent though submitted that she is having huge investment in crores of rupees but nothing is placed on record. It is clear from the statement of petitioner that petitioner is well qualified having capacity to earn. The Hon\u2019ble Madhya Pradesh High Court in the case of \u201cMamta Jaiswal Vs. Rajesh Jaiswal held that well qualified wife is not entitled to remain as an idle and claim maintenance from her husband. In short, the wife is not entitled to advantage of her own wrong, she cannot harass the husband on the count of maintenance though she is capable to earn. In the present case in hand, the petitioner\u00acwife is very qualified, she has worked with various companies. This admitted by herself, now she is claiming that she is a housewife, having no source of income. The wife who is well qualified and claiming maintenance by sitting idle is not entitled to get maintenance, secondly she herself has admitted that though her husband is connected with garment business but he has share worth rs.5,000/\u00aconly. Considering the above circumstances, it is clear that the wife is having good capacity to earn. According to respondent, she is earning but no any documentary evidence is on record that she is earning. Nothing is on record to prove the income of respondent at this primary stage. In such circumstances, in my view, at this juncture petitioner is not entitled to get maintenance. Hence I pass the following order : ORDER 1. The application is rejected. 4. Woman can\u2019t evict husband just because she pays EMI: Mumbai Family Court MUMBAI: A family court on Monday rejected a wife\u2019s interim plea seeking her estranged husband\u2019s removal from their Lokhandwala flat where she stays with him and their child, just because she pays the EMI (equated monthly installment to repay home loan). The court, while ruling in favour of the man who pays Rs 90,000 a month for household expenses, said in the current day, it is difficult to ascertain who has contributed how much while purchasing any asset or discharging any liability. \u201cIf both contribute to the household, either this way or that way, a particular spouse cannot claim exclusive right, ownership or title in the household property, merely because either the property stands in her name or she has contributed financially,\u201d said the judge. \u2026"

(i) that there has been no resumption of cohabitation as between the parties to the marriage for a period of 22 [one year] or upwards after the passing of a decree for judicial separation in a proceeding to which they were parties; or (ii) that there has been no restitution of conjugal rights as between the parties to the marriage for a period of 22 [one year] or upwards after the passing of a decree for restitution of conjugal rights in a proceeding to which they were parties.] (2) A wife may also present a petition for the dissolution of her marriage by a decree of divorce on the ground,? (i) in the case of any marriage solemnised before the commencement of this Act, that the husband had married again before such commencement or that any other wife of the husband married before such commencement was alive at the time of the solemnisation of the marriage of the petitioner: Provided that in either case the other wife is alive at the time of the presentation of the petition; or (ii) that the husband has, since the solemnisation of the marriage, been guilty of rape, sodomy or 23 [bestiality; or] 24 [(iii) that in a suit under section 18 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 (78 of 1956), or in a proceeding under section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) [or under the corresponding section 488 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (5 of 1898)], a decree or order, as the case may be, has been passed against the husband awarding maintenance to the wife notwithstanding that she was living apart and that since the passing of such decree or order, cohabitation between the parties has not been resumed for one year or upwards; or 25 [(iv) that her marriage (whether consummated or not) was solemnised before she attained the age of fifteen years and she has repudiated the marriage after attaining that age but before attaining the age of eighteen years.] Explanation. ?This clause applies whether the marriage was solemnised before or after the commencement of the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976 (68 of 1976)*.] State Amendment Uttar Pradesh: In its application to Hindus domiciled in Uttar Pradesh and also when either party to the marriage was not at the time of marriage a Hindu domiciled in Uttar Pradesh, in section 13? (i) in sub-section (1), after clause (i) insert (and shall be deemed always to have been inserted) the following clause, namely:? ?(1a) has persistently or repeatedly treated the petitioner with such cruelty as to cause a reasonable apprehension in the mind of the petitioner that it will be harmful or injurious for the petitioner to live with the other party; or?, and ?(viii) has not resumed cohabitation after the passing of a decree for judicial separation against that party and? (ii) for clause (viii) (since repealed in the principal Act) substitute (and shall be deemed to have been substituted) following clause, namely:? [ Vide Uttar Pradesh Act 13 of 1962, sec. 2 (w.e.f. 7-11-1962)]. (i) Cruelty which is a ground for dissolution of marriage may be defined as wilful and unjustifiable conduct of such character as to cause danger to life, limb or health, bodily or mental, or as to give rise to a reasonable apprehension of such a danger. The question of mental cruelty has to be considered in the light of the norms of marital ties of the particular society, to which the parties belong, their social values, status, environment in which they live. Cruelty need not be physical. If from the conduct of the spouse it is established or an inference can be legitimately drawn that the treatment of the spouse is such that it causes apprehension in the mind of the other spouse, about his or her mental welfare then this conduct amounts to cruelty; Maya Devi v. Jagdish Prasad, AIR 2007 SC 1426. (ii) Making false allegations against husband of having illicit relationship and extramarital affairs by wife in her written statement constitute mental cruelty of such nature that husband cannot be reasonably asked to live with wife. Husband is entitled to decree of divorce; Sadhana Srivastava v. Arvind Kumar Srivastava, AIR 2006 All 7. (iii) The expression ?Cruelty? as envisaged under section 13 of the Act clearly admits in its ambit and scope such acts which may even cause mental agony to aggrieved party. Intention to be cruel is not an essential element of cruelty as envisaged under section 13 (1) (ia) of the Act. It is sufficient that if the cruelty is of such type that it becomes impossible for spouses to live together; Neelu Kohli v. Naveen Kohli, AIR 2004 All 1. (iv) The levelling of false allegation by one spouse about the other having alleged illicit relations with different persons outside wedlock amounted to mental cruelty; Jai Dayal v. Shakuntala Devi, AIR 2004 Del 39.  Can my parents or his parents stop me from getting divorce ? Opinion: nobody can stop."

                "response-text": "Dear Sir, Indian Laws are known for setting aside the Registered documents on the ground that most of the people are ignorant of laws and being cheated by kith and kin.  Any registered document is private document and needs to be proved beyond suspicious. Such evidence by the executant can be placed before the Court. MADHYA PRADESH HIGH COURT Smt. Rekha Rana and Ors vs. Smt. Ratnashree Jai W.P. No. 1985 of 2005. Date :- 17/8/2005 V. RAVEENDRAN, C. and SHANTANU KEMKAR , JJ. Judgement :- V. RAVEENDRAN, C. J. :- Thus, registration of the deed is not proof of free consent. Consent is very crucial part of any contract. \u201cConsent is said to be free when it is not caused by coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation or mistake Registration of a deed merely requires the person executing the deed (executant) or any person claiming under it (claimant) or his legal representative to present the document at the proper Registration Office.[1]The Registrar is not obligated to investigate the presence of possible foul play in the execution of the deed. Thus, registration of the deed is not proof of free consent. Consent is very crucial part of any contract. \u201cConsent is said to be free when it is not caused by coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation or mistake.\u201d[2] When you register a deed, the Registrar only sees whether the executant executed the deed, whether the person presenting the deed is in fact who he claims to be and in case of a legal representative, whether such person has the authority to present it for registration.[3] He does not look into whether consent was free. A registered deed may be challenged on the following grounds: \u2022Coercion- That the executant had been coerced into executing the deed through an act that is prohibited by the Indian Penal Code 1860 or a threat thereof.[4] For example, where someone threatens to hurt you or someone close to you if you do not execute a gift deed in their favour, you are said to be coerced into executing the deed. \u2022Undue Influence- That the \u201crelations subsisting between the parties are such that one of the parties is in a position to dominate the will of the other\u201d[5] and such relation was used to manipulate the executant into executing the said deed. Imagine a scenario where a terminally ill mother is looked after by one of her sons, and that son manipulates her into leaving all her property solely to him. \u2022Fraud- That the executant had been defrauded into executing the deed by: \u2022Being led to believe as true, something which the person deceiving knows is false. \u2022Actively concealing a material fact \u2022Making a promise without intention to perform \u2022Any other deception or any act statutorily declared as fraudulent.[6] \u2022Misrepresentation- That the executant had given his consent on the basis of an innocent misrepresentation (without intent to deceive) of material facts by another party to the deed.[7] For example, B emphasizes his apartment\u2019s proximity to an upcoming metro railway project while selling it to A. Later if the metro project does not get sanctioned, it wouldn\u2019t amount to fraud because B honestly believed that the metro would be built shortly, but it would amount to misrepresentation. The above grounds are available only to that party to the deed whose consent was obtained by coercion, undue influence, fraud or misrepresentation, i.e., whose consent was not free.[8] No third party can challenge a registered deed on these grounds during the lifetime of such party.[9] In the executant\u2019s absence, like in case of wills, any individual who stands to benefit from setting aside the deed (beneficiary) may challenge it in Court, on grounds of: \u2022Lack of good title- That the transferor of the property was not the owner of it and had no right as such to transfer it. Property can be disposed of only by its actual owner.[10] Where A, a tenant, sells the tenanted premises to B, the sale is void for lack of a good title. \u2022Lack of Contractual Capacity- That the deed had been executed by a person incompetent to contract, such as being a minor, or of unsound mind.[11] However in Murlidas vs. Haridas[12], registration was held to be conclusive evidence of the fact that the executant (testator, in case of will) was sane at the time of execution of the deed and had fully intended such deed to be considered his last will and testament. As is evident from the usual trend of judgments, Indian Courts hold registration in high esteem because of the inherent solemnity of the act, that is to say, registering a deed confers a certain degree of dignity to the transaction.[13]The burden of proof lies on the person challenging the registered deed. It is important to note that it is very difficult to establish the grounds of rejection of a registered deed.

Chitra Vittal from Bangalore ordered a combo package including cake from Flowers n Cakes to India, an online florist and gift store that guarantees same day delivery and the \u201cdelivery of fresh products \u2013 always.\u201dFlowers n Cakes to India failed to deliver the product on the specified day, and when they finally did deliver it the next day, the cake was \u201csmashed up, made of cheap wine\u201d and of a quality that was entirely unacceptable to the customer. When Ms Vittal attempted to complain about the non-delivery of the product on the scheduled day, she found that the customer care numbers displayed on the website were not attended. She managed to find contact details of their Hyderabad-based sub-vendor, only to be told that they had only received their orders from Flowers n Cakes to India the morning after the scheduled date.   Five days later, Ms Vittal complained about the delayed delivery of a substandard product over a chat conversation with the company representative, Rahul, who, according to her was rude and paid no heed to her complaints. Ms Vittal then approached Arun Saxena, President of ICRPC, which runs a consumer helpline. Mr Saxena sent an email to the vendor on behalf of Ms Vittal, informing them that they had conducted Unfair Trade Practices under Section 2 (1) (r) of the Consumer Protection Act. If the vendor did not refund the full amount to Ms Vittal and pay Rs50,000 as compensation for her losses, harassment and inconvenience, Mr Saxena said, severe action would be initiated against them, seeking higher compensation of Rs1 lakh with the legal costs.   What ensued was a series of emails exchanged among Mr Saxena, Ms Vittal and Flowers n Cakes to India, where the vendor attempted to seek refuge in its disclaimer against \u201cunavoidable delays\u201d. Ms Vittal felt that the vendors entirely ignored the accusation of no-response to complaints and were repeatedly rude to her. The emails reveal comments from the vendor to the tune of \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t understand simple English language then it\u2019s not our responsibility\u201d and \u201cshe is the only one who we can call Fake\u201d.  When Mr Saxena finally said that the matter was headed to consumer court and they would have to appear in person to justify their position, Flowers n Cakes to India beat a hasty retreat. With a sudden and radical change of tone, it sent a politely apologetic email to Ms Vittal, with the promise of a full refund on the same day."

        "query-text": "My wife has plotted a conspiracy against me, she wants to trap me in false IPC 498A, 323, 406 and she took both of my kids at her parent\u2019s house in the month of Feburary \u201919. I know that I won\u2019t be able to take the custody of my kids till they are 7 years old, my son is 4 years old and my daughter is 2 years old as of now. I don\u2019t care about the final outcome of 498A,323,406 as it is false and she won\u2019t be able to prove it, I have all the phone recordings and text/whatsapp messages which are proof that its all fake and as far as maintenance is concerned that is my moral responsibility to look after my kids and pay for them. Once the court will pass the orders I will pay the monthly maintenance as well. But my major worry is I would like to meet my kids at least once every week and also want that my kids should stay with me also for a week in a month. My son goes to play way, I know it is not possible that I can take him to my home, but my daughter is just 2.5 years and she doesn\u2019t go to any school as of now, at least I can keep her with me for a week every month. I am not talking about child custody as of now, I know I will not get it as of now. But at least I should be in a position that I should get the right to meet my kids every week , 4 times in a month.    \u2022\tMy question is how to meet the kids or how to keep the kids for a week at fathers home in case the father wants them? Maintenance case and 498A, it\u2019s a long legal fight which might take years but meantime I would like to meet my kids and want that my kids should also stay at my home with me also.    \u2022\tIs there any way that I can also keep my kids with me for a week in a month? is there any way that I can also celebrate festivals with my kids at my home?    \u2022\tAre there any court orders in the past wherein the court has passed the orders that the father can also take the kids to his house for a week or let\u2019s say during school holidays or vacations? If there are any court orders passed in any case, from where can I get a copy of those court orders?   \u2022\tMy wife has given a fake two page dowry list and she has no bills to prove it, she attached the bill of fridge which is kept in their home, the entire dowry list is fake. Her parents bought some gold in the year 2010 and 2012 and I got married with her in year Jan 2015, my wife has 2 brothers, both are divorced and she also had a sister who committed suicide, she was not married and my wife is the youngest in all the siblings, she is on 4th number. Now, they have attached the bills of gold which they purchased in year 2010 and 2012 and they used the gold in their sons marriage also and they are trying to prove as if the entire gold was given to my wife and they also got the documented statement of the jeweler also that the bills are original, now the question is will those invoices be counted? Because they used the gold in the marriages of their brothers also. Please answer all my abvoe questions in details.",

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA  CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION  CIVIL APPEAL NO.2704 OF 2010  (Arising out of SLP(C) No.19935/2009) Vikram Vir Vohra ..Appellant(s)  Versus Shalini Bhalla ..Respondent(s)  J U D G M E N T  GANGULY, J.   1. Leave granted.   2. This appeal by the husband, impugns the judgment and order dated 27.07.09 of Delhi High Court which upheld the judgment and order of the Additional District Judge passed in relation to applications filed by both the parties under Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act (hereinafter \"the Act\"). The impugned judgment  permitted the respondent-wife to take the child with her to Australia. 3. The material facts of the case are that the parties to the present appeal were married as per the Hindu rites on 10.12.2000. A child, Master Shivam, was born to them on 05.08.02. In view of irreconcilable differences between the parties they had agreed for a divorce by mutual consent under Section 13-B of the Act and filed a petition to that effect and on 05.09.06 a decree of divorce on mutual consent was passed by the Additional District Judge, Delhi. 4. As regards the custody of the child there was some settlement between the parties and according to the appellant the same was incorporated in paras 7 and 9 of the petition filed under Section 13-B (2) of the Act. Those paragraphs are as under: \"The parties have agreed that the custody of the minor son Master Shivam shall remain with the mother, petitioner No.1 who being the natural mother is also the guardian of the son Master Shivam as per law laid down by the Supreme Court of India. It is, however, agreed that the father petitioner shall have right of  visitation only to the extent that the child Master Shivam shall be with the father, petitioner No.2, once in a fortnight from 10 AM to 6.30 PM on a Saturday. Petitioner No.2 shall collect the child Master Shivam from WZ-64, 2nd Floor Shiv Nagar Lane No.4, New Delhi-58 at 10 AM on a Saturday where the child is with his mother. And on the same day at by 6.30 PM, the petitioner No.2 would leave the child back at the same place with the mother i.e. petitioner No.1 and in case he does not do so petitioner No.1 the mother shall collect the child from petitioner No.2 on the same day. Both parties undertake before this Hon'ble Court that they would not create any obstruction in implementation of this arrangement. The petitioner No.1 shall take adequate care of the child in respect of health, education etc., at her own cost. In case the petitioner No.1 changes her address or takes the child outside Delhi, she shall keep petitioner No.2 informed one week in advance about the address and telephone nos. and the place where the child would be staying with the mother, to enable the petitioner No.2 to remain in touch with the child. The petitioner No.1 has received all her Stridhan and other valuables, articles and other possessions, and nothing remains due to her from the petitioner No.2. The petitioner No.1 and the child Shivam has no claim to any property or financial commitment from petitioner No.2 and all her claims are settled fully and finally\".   5. Thereafter the respondent-wife filed applications dated 07.11.06 and 9.05.08 and the  appellant-husband also filed applications dated 17.11.07 and 16.02.09 under Section 26 of the Act seeking modification of those terms and conditions about the custody of the child. 6. The respondent was basing her claim on the fact that she wanted to take the child with her to Australia where she was employed for gain with a request to revoke the visitation rights granted to the appellant for meeting the child. This she felt will be conducive to the paramount interest and welfare of the child. The appellant on the other hand sought permanent custody of the child under the changed circumstances alleging that it is not in the interest of the child to leave India permanently.   7. The Trial Court vide its order dated 06.04.09 took notice of the fact that in the joint petition of divorce, parties voluntarily agreed that the custody of the child shall remain with the mother and father shall have only visiting rights, in the manner indicated in the mutual divorce decree. The Court modified the terms and  conditions of the custody and visitation rights of the appellant about the minor child. By its order the Trial Court had allowed the respondent to take the child with her to Australia but also directed her to bring the child back to India for allowing the father visitation rights twice in a year i.e. for two terms - between 18th of December to 26th of January and then from 26th of June to 11th of July.   8. Being aggrieved by that order of the Trial Court, the appellant appealed to the High Court. It was argued by the appellant since no decree was passed by the Court while granting mutual divorce, an application under Section 26 of the Act does not lie and in the absence of specific provision in the decree regarding the custody and visitation rights of the child, the Trial Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the petition afresh after passing of the decree. 9. The High Court took into consideration the provisions of Section 26 of the Act and was of the view that the aforesaid provision is  intended to enable the Court to pass suitable orders from time to time to protect the interest of minor children. However, the High Court held that after the final order is passed in original petition of divorce for the custody of the minor child, the other party cannot file any number of fresh petitions ignoring the earlier order passed by the Court.   10. The Court took into consideration that even if the terms and conditions regarding the custody and visitation rights of the child are not specifically contained in the decree, they do form part of the petition seeking divorce by mutual consent. It was of the view that absence of the terms and conditions in the decree does not disentitle the respondent to file an application under Section 26 of the Act seeking revocation of the visitation rights of the appellant.   11. It is important to mention here that the learned Judge of the High Court had personally interviewed the child who was about 7 years old  to ascertain his wishes. The child in categorical terms expressed his desire to be in the custody and guardianship of his mother, the respondent. The child appeared to be quite intelligent. The child was specifically asked if he wanted to live with his father in India but he unequivocally refused to go with or stay with him. He made it clear in his expression that he was happy with his mother and maternal grandmother and desired only to live with his mother. The aforesaid procedure was also followed by the learned Trial Court and it was also of the same view after talking with the child.   12. Being aggrieved with the judgment of the High Court the appellant has approached this Court and hence this appeal by way of Special Leave Petition.   13. We have also talked with the child in our chambers in the absence of his parents. We found him to be quite intelligent and  discerning. The child is in school and from the behaviour of the child, we could make out that he is well behaved and that he is receiving proper education.   14. The child categorically stated that he wants to stay with his mother. It appears to us that the child is about 8-10 years of age and is in a very formative and impressionable stage in his life. The welfare of the child is of paramount importance in matters relating to child custody and this Court has held that welfare of the child may have a primacy even over statutory provisions [See Mausami Moitra Ganguli vs. Jayant Ganguli - (2008) 7 SCC 673, para 19, page 678]. We have considered this matter in all its aspects. 15. The argument of the learned counsel for the appellant, that in view of the provisions of Section 26 of the Act, the order of custody of the child and the visitation rights of the  appellant cannot be changed as they are not reflected in the decree of mutual divorce, is far too hyper technical an objection to be considered seriously in a custody proceeding. A child is not a chattel nor is he/she an article of personal property to be shared in equal halves.   16. In a matter relating to custody of a child, this Court must remember that it is dealing with a very sensitive issue in considering the nature of care and affection that a child requires in the growing stages of his or her life. That is why custody orders are always considered interlocutory orders and by the nature of such proceedings custody orders cannot be made rigid and final. They are capable of being altered and moulded keeping in mind the needs of the child.   17. In Rosy Jacob vs. Jacob A Chakramakkal - [(1973) 1 SCC 840], a three judge Bench of  this Court held that all orders relating to custody of minors were considered to be temporary orders. The learned judges made it clear that with the passage of time, the Court is entitled to modify the order in the interest of the minor child. The Court went to the extent of saying that even if orders are based on consent, those orders can also be varied if the welfare of the child so demands.   18. The aforesaid principle has again been followed in Dhanwanti Joshi vs. Madhav Unde - [(1998) 1 SCC 112]. 19. Even though the aforesaid principles have been laid down in proceedings under the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, these principles are equally applicable in dealing with the custody of a child under Section 26 of the Act since in both the situations two things are common; the first, being orders relating to custody of a growing child and  secondly, the paramount consideration of the welfare of the child. Such considerations are never static nor can they be squeezed in a strait jacket. Therefore, each case has to be dealt with on the basis of its peculiar facts.   20. In this connection, the principles laid down by this Court in Gaurav Nagpal vs. Sumedha Nagpal reported in (2009) 1 SCC 42 are very pertinent. Those principles in paragraphs 42 and 43 are set out below: \"42. Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 provides for custody of children and declares that in any proceeding under the said Act, the court could make, from time to time, such interim orders as it might deem just and proper with respect to custody, maintenance and education of minor children, consistently with their wishes, wherever possible. 43. The principles in relation to the custody of a minor child are well settled. In determining the question as to who should be given custody of a minor child, the paramount consideration is the \"welfare of the child\" and not rights of the parents under a statute for the time being in force\".   21. That is why this Court has all along insisted on focussing the welfare of the child and accepted it to be the paramount consideration guiding the Court's discretion in custody order. See Thrity Hoshie Dolikuka vs. Hoshiam Shavaksha Dolikuka - [AIR 1982 SC 1276], para 17.   22. In the factual and legal background considered above, the objections raised by the appellant do not hold much water. 23. Now coming to the question of the child being taken to Australia and the consequent variations in the visitation rights of the father, this Court finds that the Respondent mother is getting a better job opportunity in Australia. Her autonomy on her personhood cannot be curtailed by Court on the ground of a prior order of custody of the child. Every person has a right to develop his or her potential. In fact a right to development is a basic human right. The respondent-mother cannot be asked to choose between her child  and her career. It is clear that the child is very dear to her and she will spare no pains to ensure that the child gets proper education and training in order to develop his faculties and ultimately to become a good citizen. If the custody of the child is denied to her, she may not be able to pursue her career in Australia and that may not be conducive either to the development of her career or to the future prospects of the child. Separating the child from his mother will be disastrous to both.   24. Insofar as the father is concerned, he is already established in India and he is also financially solvent. His visitation rights have been ensured in the impugned orders of the High Court. His rights have been varied but have not been totally ignored. The appellant-father, for all these years, lived without the child and got used to it. 25. In the application dated 9.5.2008 filed before the Additional District Judge, Delhi, the mother made it clear in paragraph 12 that she is ready to furnish any undertaking or bond in order to ensure her return to India and to make available to the father, his visitation rights subject to the education of the child. This Court finds that so far as the order which had been passed by the High Court, affirming the order of the Trial Court, the visitation rights of the appellant-father have been so structured as to be compatible with the educational career of the child. This Court finds that in this matter judicial discretion has been properly balanced between the rights of the appellant and those of the respondent.   26. In that view of the matter, this Court refuses to interfere with the order passed by the High Court. The appeal is dismissed with the direction that the respondent-mother,  before taking the child to Australia, must file an undertaking to the satisfaction of the Court of Additional District Judge-01, (West), Delhi within a period of four weeks from date. No order as to costs.   .......................J. (G.S.SINGHVI) .......................J. (ASOK KUMAR GANGULY) New Delhi March 25, 2010     Feel Free to Call"

Two Days after physically and on papers vacating the premises they come back again and lock some rooms and claim their possession and say they want one month more time to clear the rent. Handing taking over procedure was completed and Documents were signed by single partner only.       Now Tenant is saying he will not agree to documentation done by him since the other partner (his wife) hasn't signed the documents.       My Question is    Is it necessary for both the partners of a partnership firm to sign on a document ? Will the document be authentic /relevant if only one partner has signed on the document (stamp paper notarized) ?   Can Partner who has signed can straight away deny just because other partner has not signed ?",

        "query-text": "Hello Law experts,      I had booked a residential apartment in Kolkata in 2015. As per the original agreement it was supposed to be completed by Dec'17 with 6 months grace period. From around start of 2017 developer met with an issue and the construction was totally stopped. upon several follow-up I could not get any constructive response from them and after awaiting couple of more years I was almost giving up and trying to withdraw the invested 40% amount. All of a sudden got a call from developer around end of 2019 and was told that they would like to reconcile and agreed to give some compensation for the delays.   Accordingly a supplementary agreement was signed on Jan 2020 with revised cost with some discounts as compensation(Also I had changed my original unit to a new one in same project based on family requirement).    Upon the signing of that supplementary agreement, in January'20 itself I have cleared 65% of total cost value (as per new unit) and rest amount as per demand raised by developer from then onwards.   I was completely relying on developer inputs on construction update (as being based out of City and travel being restricted due to Covid) and based on that was paying the demand amount as and when possible. Honestly, many a times, I got to know discrepancies between the raised demand construction update against the actual work status, however based on the goodwill that the developer showed in reconciliation, never raised that with them and tried to pay as and when possible. I would not claim that all the demand thereafter was paid right on time, there may have been delays for some payments by few weeks, however my focus was to clear as much as possible even during the prevailing pandemic. By end of 2020 almost 80% was paid and by February 2021, 90% was completely paid.    From that time onwards, I have been repeatedly trying to get in touch with developer to sit F2F and work for the further action to take handover and possession. But to my surprise the developer started tantrums and refused to sit F2F for any kind of talks and issued a huge late payment charges all the way starting from 2015. All my attempt to reach out to them went futile and all my grievances about wrong demand on false construction status is still answered. Despite that I again written to them and agrees to pay 100% of amount provided they give handover in amicable fashion. Till now 95% of total amount is paid.    My questions are as follows:   1. What legal action can I take if developer refuses to give handover and continue intimidating with huge interest?   2. Technically can they charge interest from 2015, when new supplement agreement/cost was agreed on 2020?   3. The project is WB HIRA registered and status is showing \"Under Construction\" and \"Completed without CC\". Can developer force me pay 100% of sale price and charge interest?   4. What documents should I ask from developer to protect my possession right?         Sincerely appreciate your valuable advice.",

Legal Action : You may be advised of what not all from Recovery suit, to consumer case to Bankrupcy suit etc, BUT the first and the best is to got to RERAcourt of WB - majority of the RERAcourts are functioning online and ytou can file your complaint for Delay Penatly and Immediate possession as per the RERA act. This is also the fastest way to give a face value to the Builder Buyer Agreement or any agreement you have been sitting on for years. BY RERAyou will get an order wherein the developer will be asked to pay to delay penalty and hand over the possession.    B. The terms of agreement remains same for everyone be it the builder or the buyer, the builder can not shy away with the terms of 2015 agreement and vice versa and as there has been change in price , the interest if any to be charges will be charged 2020 onwards, moreso old interest if any will be charged at older paid amount.    C. Please read the section 18 of the RERAact - the builder can not force you to pay 100% of the amount if the CC or OC has not been taken by the builder.    d. File a RERA complaint - developer will not give you anything unless court ask them to do so..   Best of Luck"

Issuing a legal notice is beneficial to you  because it serves as an opportunity given to the builder/developer to come for a compromise and reconcile the matter fruitfully additionally it will be an evidence that you have exhausted the remedy available before you before approaching the court of law for relief and remedy in this regard. 2. This legal notice should not be sent by email, but to be sent by a registered post with an acknowledgment card, preferably through your lawyer. . 3. The one sided agreement conditions are not binding on the buyer. The Supreme Court has held that the incorporation of one-sided and unreasonable clauses in the Apartment Buyer's Agreement constitutes an unfair trade practice under Section 2(1)(r) of the Consumer Protection Act. 4. The developer cannot cancel the agreement unilaterally. You can file a civil suit against him for specific releif if he resorts to this illegal practice. 5. . To avoid the issues of not present before court at the crucial times, you may better engage the services of an advocate who will take care of the case and will prevent you being embarrassed due to this.  You cannot ride two horses together, hence you may have to choose between the case and other commitments, so to avoid this situation, you may better take the assistance of an advocate in the local to take care of your legal needs in this aspect.  6. The one sided agreement can be challenged in the consumer court if the developer is reluctant to hear your concerns over this  You should insist on producing the  OC/CC before taking possession of the property or else you can refuse to take possession as well as the balance amount because it is the fault of the developer to not to produce the  OC after completion of the construction.  7. That is a different subject to that of your subject."

Nowadays my only communication is primarily e-mail to them as they are not responding seriously over phone and refusing to have discussion, forcing me to take their decision for interest as final. For RERA no legal notice required, For consumer case yes , you should send. 2. Can the legal notice be served through e-mail? Or should I seek for any legal advice for that?Yes given the Judgment dated 19.07.2020 by Hon'ble Supreme court ,Notice / summons sent by Whats app and Email are admissible, an affidavit in regard to the same need to be given to the court concerned after sending notice through email / whats app  3. Unfortunately the original agreement (the T&C of which apply mutatis-mutandis to Supplementary agreement signed in 2020 apart from unit/sale price), totally favors developer being drafted by their legal team. It says that should there be any dispute, it is solely developer right to appoint a legal person as arbitrator and his decision would be final, binding to both parties.  these agreements are one sided agreement and as the courts understands the same, such agreements hold no value when it comes to rights of parties. Does this anyway reduce my right to proceed with complaint to WB-HIRA or consumer court? The developer is in no mood now for discussion as as 95% of sale price been paid.No  4. Does the developer have rights to terminate the agreement at his own discretion? It is also mentioned in Original agreement signed in 2015. As per their agreement Yes, but as 95% has been paid any such termination will be illegal and thedeveloper will have to refund 100%received money with interest. 5. In case I file case in online at RERA tribunal (WB-HIRA) or approach consumer court, to what extent my physical presence is required for follow-up? I am based out of my home state for service and need to leave in max. couple of months with elderly parents staying here. Developer knows this point and I desperately need handover by that time.  No - physical presence not required for RERA and for consumer court presence at time of filing will be required.6. Can the developer appointed architect's decision can be final for the completion of the unit/project and can be binding on me to pay 100% in absence of CC/OC from HIRA? The agreement mentions that way. No, as per RERA act no offer of possession can be given without OC and CC - only - unless developer plays Deemed Completion Card.7. Is there any implications on the matter for recent decision by Supreme Court to struck down WB-HIRA?No - the striking down of WB-HIRA will not affect the registrations, sanctions and permissions previously granted under the legislation prior to the date of the said judgement.  Best of Luck"

She intentionally disrespects me and my family   4. Just because I married her, I kept quiet for a long time. At one point, I started asking questions and started reacting to their lies. When confronted, they shift blame and play the victim for my reaction(totally ignoring their lies or action which caused my reaction). I wasn't going out of control. I was just trying to question whenever they lie. They never want to admit their lies or apologize, and shift the blame on others with full of lies.    5. My father-in-law had a criminal case against him - Details unknown. I didn't do a good job in background verification before marriage as I trusted them completely.       I and my family go through a lot of mental trauma due to their pathological lying behavior, their dependency with my wife, my wife's background action. What is the best way to stop them doing all these things anymore? Is this considered as cheating? Does law allows taking action for this?",

Bearing in mind, the term 'fraud' used in the section 12(c) of the Hindu Marriage act, it includes every and any misrepresentation or suppression of facts. It is further added to your knowledge that fraudulent misrepresentation or concealment with regards to the financial status of the family of your spouse is also considered as a fraud. Smt. Urmila Devi vs Shri Narinder Singh on 12 September, 2006 [Equivalent citations: AIR 2007 HP 19, 2006 (2) ShimLC 445] It was held that, 'In case any fact or circumstance is concealed which is of such a nature that it shall materially interfere with happy marital life it will definitely be a material fact or circumstance. In my opinion, withholding of any such fact which if disclosed would have resulted in the husband not agreeing to the marriage is a material fact.' The involvement of your father in law in a criminal case would also be considered as a material fact that was concealed from you before the marriage.  Secondly, The Delhi high court in a similar case ruled, The interference of parents in the married life of their daughters has become a major reason for discord between young couples after marriage, .While upholding a divorce decree, Justice Kailash Gambhir expressed concern over cases landing up in courts that show frequent rifts between couples due to parents' persistent interference in their daughters' married life.HC granted a decree of divorce to a man on the grounds of his in-law' frequent interference in his marital life and noted that parents should \"draw a line\" and let their daughters lead a happy, married life.\"All parents guide, teach and discipline their daughters and are concerned about their welfare after marriage but it is imperative for parents to draw a line as the prime concern should be that their daughter is happily settled in a new atmosphere at the husband's place,\" Justice Gambhir said.        ."

The term \u2018Gambling\u2019 per-se has not been defined in the Public Gambling Act 1867 and the terms \u2013 gambling, gaming, betting and wagering are the terms which are often used synonymously, and of all \u2018Gambling\u2019 being regarded as embracing all the terms. The term \u2018Gaming\u2019 too has not been defined under the Indian Gambling laws, however, an inference can be drawn from the English Betting and Gaming Act, 1960, wherein its is defined as \u201cplaying of a game of chance and skill combined, and a pretended game of chance and skill combined, but not any athletic game or sport\u201d.  As per the Indian Contract Act, 1872: Section 30 says in this Section prevents any person from bringing a suit for recovery of any winnings won by way of a \"wager.\" (An agreement which is based on a future uncertain event wherein the loss of one person is the gain of the other). Thus no claim for recovery of any winnings in lotteries, gambling or betting can be brought before the court. The position of law in India is such that it may be perfectly legal to buy a lottery ticket, but the winner of such a lottery will have no remedy against the lottery agency if the said agency refuses to pay the winnings.   For example, would an individual having to check a website or email in order to know if they have won or not be, considered as consideration?If the facility is available to check online the the price and receive by email then you can check it."

But CALA has fixed the price of 2,50,000/- per acre based Basic Price of Dry and WET lands sale deeds. Since there is NO sale deeds were executed last 3 years from the date of Notification Date in our village, We also awarded 2,50,000/- per acre . We have raised our concern about the Basic Rate was very less in front of Revenue Authorities but they told that first you accept this award and go for ARBITRATION request for enhanced compensation. So We have signed over the award papers and the same amounts had credited in our accounts in 2022. Later we have submitted ARBITRATION requests in front of District Collector/CALA and with supporting docs like Google Map of our abutting lands to NH and Awards of Nearest Village Lands (7,00,000/- per acre) which are similar type of our lands and having distance of 500 mts from our lands.   We have fought for the below amounts as per RFCTLARR Act 2013   Section 26 (1) (a) or 26 (1) (b) or 26 (1) (c) Whichever is higher to be considered as Basic Rate    4,50,000/- 7,00,000 or 0 // NH land Farmer Expected Basic Price is : 7,00,000/-    2,50,000/- 2,50,000 or 0 // CALA Calculated Value is : 2,50,000/-   Finally Collector passed an AWARD without any enhanced compensation saying that i) Market Value Certificate not submitted for abutting to NH lands that is 4,50,000/- since SRO says that there is survey number maintenance in their records. ii) Nearest Village Basic Rate and Revenue Villages are different hence Arbitration request was denied.    Now we (around 6 farmers) are all planning to file a CASE on High Court, Kindly confirm on the below queries.   1)\tCan we file single case as a writ petition in HC instead of individual cases for enhancement of compensation?   If Single Case possible, Pls provide any details of the case judgments of HC/SC etc.   2)\tRevenue and Collector/CALA escaping from implementation of section 26 (3) (b) because there is NO sale deed transactions executed in 2016,2017,2018.        Can we file any defamation or take action on them petition along with writ petition itself???      3) Kindly let us know any useful information related to our issue as most of the farmers are BPL families.

        "query-text": "It\u2019s a case of partition among joint family members of sons and daughters, a registered deed was executed in 1975 and given share to all including daughters & after father\u2019s death, properties not covered in registered deed shared only among sons through creating unregistered documents & also additional ancestors properties and that also not shared among all family members and also further bought certain properties by utilizing joint family funds and sale proceeds of interstate properties and even that also not shared among all.    Now in court case of partition by a daughter need suggestions    1.\tBrothers are hiding unregistered deed of 1987 & taking stand of oral partition they executed and is it valid?   2.\tNow we have unregistered deed of photo copy but not original singed by brothers and can we bring it as evidence in court if sons don\u2019t bring it to court to justify oral partition.    3.\tRegarding partition suit by daughter against his brothers    In 1970 registered deed of partition executed among sons and daughters and in respect of one property of total 20 acres only 18 acres brought into partition and not said anything about 2 acres left. In that location 18 acres got shared only among 3 sons and in other location daughters got their share.    In 2003, 3 sons went for amendment of 1970 deed in respect of 18 acres of land allotted to them and changed the directions as per their requirements and in that even included the partition of 2 acres what is left out but not elaborated anything about including such extra 2 acres land into their shared but without explaining anything of it, took signature of daughters and amended the deed of 1970.    1.\tNow we are filing partition suit in respect of those properties which were not included in 1970 deed and in that can we even question and include the extra of land which was amended in 2003 without elaborating anything about it while taking the consent of daughters and registered it.    2.\tWithout elaborating anything about 2 acres of land what is left out, can they include in their share without explaining anything about it and reason of amendment is only for changing the direction of lands allotted as per deed of 1970 as per records of amendment.    3.\tIn respect of properties which were not covered under deed of 1970 were shared orally among sons and it\u2019s as per sons justifications. So without giving any share to daughters is valid oral partition.    4.\tIn partition suit prayer \u2013 if daughter prays for \u201cnull and void\u201d of sale deeds on sites and houses executed by her brothers then will it attract stamp duty on market value or normal court fees is enough.    5.\tIn prayer \u2013 \u201ca Sale deed executed does not bind on lawful share of the plaintiff\u201d sentence is equal to meaning of \u201cnull and void\u201d of sale deeds and will it attract market value of stamp duty or what?   6.\tAs per latest citations - in partition suits, is it true that \"null and void\" prayer also does not attract stamp duty for joint family properties",

You should decide now whether you wish to continue in the marriage or seek divorce.  So, in accordance to your decision , You have two options: Option 1: 1) If you wish to continue in the marriage, you should file a restitution of conjugal rights petition (sec 9 of hindu marriage act), 2) The court shall initiate reconciliation proceedings through district legal services authority and pass orders for restitution of conjugal rights.  3) Now if the wife does not join the husband even after restitution of conjugal rights, even after 1 year from date of order, the husband is entitled for divorce .  Option 2: 1) File for divorce under section 13 of hindu marriage act. 2) The court shall initiate reconciliation proceedings through district legal services authority and if reconciliation fails, then court will  pass orders on divorce  The difference between Option 1 and 2  is that by filing of Restitution of conjugal rights petition, the husband can use the said application in his defense  if any Dowry or domestic violence case is filed against him by wife and show that he was always interested in saving the marriage and whereas wife has been making false allegations.

I more found out that the said company established on Dec,2012 and the A/c opened with immediate sanctioning loan by bank. The entire money which I paid during my purchase was transferred on-line to the seller having savings bank A/C in the same branch. The bank has declared this property as NPA in July,2014 and bank allowed borrower/seller to withdraw all money from his saving a/c by SELF cheques form same bank and branch knowing that his other A/C is NPA without attaching his PAN number.    After knowing this I met with bank manager to make him know the current status and fact, but felt that he knew everything before my visit to him. Bank denied to co-operate and even refused to take any criminal action against the seller and stated pressurizing me in different way even politicly also to pay the NPA value which was not taken by me. Bank even knowing everything published a e-auction notice on 17.02.2015 and hide present encumbrance occurred without giving any intimation to me. One of the builder also involved in this conspiracy with bank manager and seller and all they are found to be good friends of each other.    I filled criminal suite against the seller as well as broker and bank manager and appealed civil court for permanent injunction on sale of this property in February, 2015. Both these cases are pending for trials.    Later I also came to know that on April, 2015 the actual borrower/seller has filled an appeal to DRT asking for time.    I know that a blunder has happened that I purchased this property with a certified deed copy. But need your view about my position and writes over this property in legal way.",

You may read the following article also.  ====================================================================================== Significance of a Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) in a pending Accident Case   A Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) is an official document issued by the Indian Police or government authority in India. It acknowledges any criminal records that an individual may have against their name and, if such records are clear, it issues a clearance certificate, which may be required for Indian or foreign citizens who are currently or have resided in India for the following reasons: 1.Pursuing professional positions that need independence; 2.Looking to relocate or obtain visas for other countries; 3.Taking care of an organization's demand; A PCC from India does not have the time of legitimacy to back up its assertion. For the most part, it is legal for six months.   Significance of PCC A valid Police Clearance Certificate, whether for employment, study, or travel, indicates that the individualhas no criminal convictions throughout their time or stay in the country. Assume the individual was involved in criminal activity or were apprehended due to a law violation in any manner. In that instance, specific notices from the concerned country will appear on their PCC, including the infringement details. Therefore, possessing a Police Clearance Certificate demonstrates their morality and prudence as guests or residents. Employers and travel specialists may raise concerns if theycannot provide PCC, implying that they are unlikely to be well-behaved citizens of the country. Definition of Petty case as per Karnataka Police Act Petty cases  \u201cPetty offence\u201d means any offence punishable only with fine not exceeding one thousand rupees, but does not include any offence so punishable under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1931, or under any other law which provides for convicting the accused person in his absence on a plea of guilty. Many sections in the Motor Vehicle Act are compoundable. It means if you commit a traffic violation, are booked for the same, and if the offence is compoundable, you can pay fine and get the case closed. Since you have paid fine, doesn\u2019t seem it would affect you in anyway. Alternative Remedies to come out of pending Moto Vehicle Accident Cases: Alternatively if offences are punishable under sections of 278, 279 and 304A of Indian Penal Code, then the accused may approach the Hon\u2019ble High Court by filing quashing petition under section 482 of Criminal Procedure Code by convincing the complainant and thus such case may be quashed getting clear acquittal for getting PCC. Components affecting PCC 1) Having a substantial criminal record: If a person has been punished or incarcerated, their PCC will reflect this. It is essential to note that being held for more than a year may affect police checks. Additionally, outstanding advances or service bills would make obtaining a PCC more difficult. 2) Association with a criminal organization: If a person is a member of an association, club, or sorority and has a criminal past, this may impact the credibility of their PCC. Any contribution to the gathering, especially those involving criminal activity, may arouse suspicions. 3) Record of unethical behaviour: A person's lengthy-time records demonstrate their upstanding reputation as a resident. If the experts believe that they are not decent or may threaten the country in any way, shape, or form, they are authorized to reject a police leeway declaration. Individuals seeking an Indian PCC can be divided into the following categories according to their nationality and present residence: a)Indian citizens residing in India; b)Indian nationals residing outside of India; c)Nationals from other countries who have settled in India; d)Indian citizens residing in India. For Indian citizens living in India, the Indian government has modified the PCC application process to a self-improved approach in which individuals may apply for a PCC online through the Passport Seva Kendra (PSK).   Impact of Traffic Violations on PCC In the case of Biju T.C. vs The Station House Officer[1], the Kerala High Court ruled thatpolice officers could not refuse to issue a Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) to a citizenbased on his involvement in a criminal case and that the PCC must be given after considering the case's nuances. Justice K VinodChandran issued the decision after reviewing an appeal filed by T.C.Biju of Airport Nagar in Vappalassery, Ernakulam. Biju is a taxi driver employed by Cochin International Airport Ltd (CIAL), and CIAL has requested that he construct a PCC to continue working there. As a result, Biju documented a request before the Nedumbassery police headquarters sub-monitor to get the PCC. Despite this, PCC was denied to him because he was involved in a criminal case. Following this, Biju filed an appeal before the high court, questioning the Police's denial of PCC and designating the sub-overseer and Ernakulam country S.P. as inverse responsible for the situation. In contrast to the Police's argument that PCC cannot be granted to people involved in criminal proceedings, the court ruled that if the applicant is engaged in wrongdoing, authentication must be provided specifying the nature of the crime the solicitor is involved in. The police authorities cannot refuse the applicant's testimony. Minor traffic offences (such as speeding and running a stop sign or red light) are often dealt with separately from more severelaw violations. Minor tiny criminal offences are punished less harshly, and the judicial procedures are less formal. Furthermore, the municipal court, which hears minor traffic violations, is separate from the criminal court in many jurisdictions.   PCC in case of Pending Accident Case In the case of The State of Arunachal Pradesh vsRamchandraRabidas[2], the Supreme Court ruled that a person who commits offences under the Motor Vehicles Act, such as speeding and reckless driving, can also be charged under the Indian Penal Code because both statutes operate independently. It went on to say that, as India's mechanization accelerates, the number of street traffic accidents and fatalities will rise. A panel of Justices InduMalhotra and SanjivKhanna overturned a December 22, 2008 judgement of the Gauhati High Court holding that an individual was arrested for over-speeding, dangerous driving, and other connected offences under the Motor Vehicles Act could not be charged under the IPC. While, according to Section 6 of the Passports Act, 1967, an individual's identity application may be denied if they have a criminal past or have proceedings pending. It is possible to ensure that they are available for the preliminary duration. If they were involved in a criminal investigation, but the accusations against them were dropped, they may be required to submit an endorsement stating the same. It will also cover circumstances when warrants have been issued in their name.  In any event, Commissioner of Police Dr K Venkatesham warned in 2018 that traffic offenders in Pune would not receive a police declaration (PCC), which is required to obtain a visa. PCC is also required by many firms when employing new employees.Venkatesham stated that they were compiling a list of traffic offenders and would forward their information to the appropriate authorities, adding that such individuals would not be given a PCC.   Conclusion Road accidents have been a significant source of concern in India; therefore,individuals should double-check and follow traffic laws. A Police Clearance Certificate is essential since it demonstrates that a person does not have a criminal record and also assists an individual in establishing their innocence. However, the procedure of obtaining a PCC certificate is complex, so it is always advisable to contact a professional who can lawfully get such a certificate. In criminal cases, where the hearing is ongoing in court, the Police will refrain from immediately giving a PCC for obtaining a visa until the judgment has been given and the accused has been acquitted. *****   [1]WP(C).No.14360 of 2015.

Since X and Y both died before Mr. Z, their share of the property will pass on to their legal heirs. In this case, X has one son A, who has died, leaving behind his son B. So, B will inherit the share of his father X. Y has 5 sons C, D, E, F, G. Since Y died before Mr. Z, his share of the property will pass on to his legal heirs. In this case, the legal heirs of Y are his sons C, D, E, F, G. Therefore, the property will be divided into 6 equal shares (1 share for each legal heir) and B, C, D, E, F, and G will each inherit 1/6th of the property. Each legal heir will inherit 1/6th of the property. So, in this case, B, C, D, E, F, and G will each inherit Rs. 16.67 (100/6). An unregistered partition of property among legal heirs may be considered valid if it is done with mutual consent and the shares are defined clearly. However, it is always advisable to get the partition deed registered to avoid any future disputes. If any legal heir has not signed the partition deed, their share may not be affected, and they may still be entitled to their share of the property as per the legal inheritance rules. Therefore, it is important to ensure that all legal heirs sign the partition deed to avoid any future disputes."

I have dealt with such cases in Supreme Court. All your purpose can resolved if your husband execute a Power of Attorney (POA) from UK through Indian Embassy/ Consulate. In the simplest of terms, it is the power (right) that a person (principal) grants to an attorney (a legal representative) . A principal-legal representative relationship is established between the two and the principal would be bound by the acts of the legal representative. For instance, if a person has purchased a property in India and cannot be physically present to process the registration, he can delegate these rights/duties to any relative/friend by means of a registered power of attorney. In a special POA, the power of the agent is restricted and limited to a specific purpose. A special POA may be transaction specific and the POA ceases on the completion of transaction. Under a general POA, broad powers are granted to the representative to make decisions on behalf of the principal. Besides, the representative can also carry out the various activities on behalf of the principal without any limitation on transactions. Signatures of the notary or judge before whom the POA is executed are required to be authenticated by the duly accredited representative of the Indian Embassy/Consulate. According to Section 3 of the Diplomatic and Consular Officers (Oaths and Fees) Act, 1948, notarising a deed from an authorised officer of the Indian Consulate/Embassy would be considered a valid notary. Such a POA is not required to be stamped at the time of execution. However, it needs to be stamped within three months from the date of receipt of the POA in India. Stamp duty would be payable according to Section 2(17) read with Schedule-I of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, when the deed is presented for registration in India. I have observed that there have been many cases where people resort to property sale through POA to avoid payment of stamp duty, which is illegal. Besides, selling properties where the owner has only right over possession and no right over ownership through POA is also illegal. Proper transfer of title and ownership cannot take place, if the sale is done through a POA and not by means of a sale deed. You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification. I hope you and your family are safe and healthy. Stay home and be safe during Covid-19.   Gopal Verma,Advocate on Record & Amicus Curiae,Supreme Court of India"

His blood relative may be his Power of Attorney. Discuss for more details. =============================================================== What Happens If A Co-Owner Wants To Give Up His Ownership Rights? Swapnil Singh, one of our users asks, \"How does surrender of property from one co-owner to another workout. Are there are any charges involved?\" Many of you might have had a similar question.  In simple words, you can transfer your property to another person in three ways \u2014 i) a sale/transfer deed ii) a gift deed iii) Relinquishment deed. The latter is what will come into play in Swapnil's case. A co-owner in a property who is willing to give up his or her rights over the property can resort to the relinquishment deed which allows for a smooth transfer. Often, legal heirs who are giving up their stake in a property are asked to sign this deed for clarity. For example, take Mahima Sinha's case. When 28-year-old Sinha got married, her mother insisted that she should sign the relinquishment deed before she goes to her new home. She was compensated in terms of liquid money because the property was to be shared among two of her brothers who lived with their mother. Signing the deed meant that Sinha wouldn't (or couldn't) come back for a share in the property. Let's look at what it entails:   It is usually signed by a legal heir relinquishing the property in the favour of another legal heir. It could be an ancestral, parental or joint property. It also takes place when a parent dies without leaving a will. The property must be owned by more than one person. It is irrevocable even when the one who is relinquishing without being compensated. As with all documents related to the transfer of immovable property, a release deed needs to be signed by both parties, stamped and registered. Stamp duty will be applicable only on the portion of the property that is relinquished. You cannot relinquish the property in favour of a non-co-owner. If you plan to transfer your property to someone else, it would be treated as a gift deed and would attract stamp duty charges. As per The Registration Act of 1908, relinquishment comes under Section 17 which means it has to be compulsorily registered at a sub-registrar's office. The document may be presented for registration either in the office of the Sub-Registrar in whose sub-district the document was executed or in the office of any other Sub-Registrar under the State Government at which all the persons executing and claiming under the document desire the same to be registered. Unregistered relinquishment deed is not permissible as legal proof of relinquishment. Since relinquishment is a transfer and not a gift, there are no tax benefits."

Indian law mandates the employment bonds to be \u201creasonable\u201d in order to be valid. Though the bond, that any organization signs with an employee stands null and void as per the Constitution of India but employer may initiate action against you for recovery and till judicial verdict is in your favor, the  bond conditions are applicable.  the Madras High Court in Toshnial Brothers (Pvt) Ltd v E Eswarprasad & Ors held that the existence of a legal injury accruing as a consequence of breach is a pre-requisite for claiming liquidated damages in accordance with section 74 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.  In other words, the employer must show a legal injury automatically resulting from the breach of the commitment to serve for a minimum period.According to the Court, a presumption of legal injury arises incases\u201cwhere the employer or the management concerned was shown to have either incurred any expenditure or involved itself into financial commitments to either give any special training either within the country or abroad or in having conferred any special benefit or favour to the detriment of the claimant in favour of the violator involving monetary commitments.\u201d The inevitable conclusion from the foregoing decision is that the employer must prove that the employee was the beneficiary of special favour or training or concession at the expense of the employer. Otherwise, actual injury accruing as a result of the breach would have to be proved.   Thus you may wait for the employer to initiate legal steps in this regard which can be challenged on the basis of their claim for this."

The said order may be reproduced hereunder for ready reference:- \"This Tribunal has already taken a considered view in Misc. Appeal No.100/2013 arising out of S.A. No.132/2012 (Delhi-I) M/s Shree Acid & Chemical Ltd. & Another vs. M/s ASREC (India) Ltd. & Ors. that when an appeal is filed under Section 18, requirement of pre- deposit cannot be wished away. Having known this view, the counsel for the appellant still insists on making submission to draw distinction between the judgment and the statutes and states that there will be some scope where requirement of pre deposit may not be there. Since this Tribunal has already taken a considered view, after hearing the counsel on all aspect, the Tribunal does not deem it proper to hear the counsel for the appellant afresh in this regard. Since 25% of the amount determined is the minimum requirement of the pre-deposit, the appellant would be required to make the pre-deposit of the amount what is the minimum requirement. Let the appellant deposit 25% of the amount determined. Two months time is given to the appellant to make the pre-deposit. The Waiver Application (IA No.17 of 2013) is disposed off accordingly. 3) It was explained by the Supreme Court in Narayan Chandra Ghosh vs. UCO Bank and Ors. (supra) as under:- \"7. Section 18(1) of the Act confers a statutory right on a person aggrieved by any order made by the Debts Recovery Tribunal under Section 17 of the Act to prefer an appeal to the Appellate Tribunal. However, the right conferred under Section 18(1) is subject to the condition laid down in the second proviso thereto. The second proviso postulates that no appeal shall be entertained unless the borrower has deposited with the Appellate Tribunal fifty per cent of the amount of debt due from him, as claimed by the secured creditors or determined by the Debts Recovery Tribunal, whichever is less. However, under the third proviso to the sub-section, the Appellate Tribunal has the power to reduce the amount, for the reasons to be recorded in writing, to not less than twenty-five per cent of the debt, referred to in the second proviso. Thus, there is an absolute bar to entertainment of an appeal under Section 18 of the Act unless the condition precedent, as stipulated, is fulfilled. Unless the borrower makes, with the Appellate Tribunal, a pre- deposit of fifty per cent of the debt due from him or determined, an appeal under the said provision cannot be entertained by the Appellate Tribunal. The language of the said proviso is clear and admits of no ambiguity."

The Supreme Court has recently ruled that the High Courts can quash an FIR against a person if it did not prima facie disclose any offence. if upon the admitted facts and the documents relied upon by the complainant or the prosecution and without weighing or sifting evidence, no case is made out, the criminal proceedings instituted against the accused are required to be dropped or quashed\", the bench said. Where the allegations in the FIR or the complaint or the accompanying documents taken at their face value, do not constitute the offence alleged, the person proceeded against in such a frivolous criminal litigation has to be saved. A Hindu male is legally obligated to maintain his spouse. Maintenance includes provision for food, residence, clothing, education and medical attendance and treatment.Maintenance is not merely a legal right. It is part and parcel of basic human right. For weaker sections, it is a problem in the sense that their very survival rest on the maintenance. The object behind the provision is two-fold: firstly, to prevent vagrancy resulting from stained relation between the husband and wife, and secondly, to ensure that the indigent litigating spouse is not handicapped in defending or prosecuting the case due to want of money.There are various factors that come for the consideration of the court while determining alimony. Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act empowers the Court to award maintenance pendente lite and litigation expenses to a party who has no independent income sufficient for his/her support in proceedings pending under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, having regard to the income of the parties. The Proviso to Section 24 provides that application under Section 24 shall be disposed of within 60 days of the date of service of notice on the opposite party.A wife who is well qualified and is capable to earn cannot sit idle and claim maintenance from her husband"

Ever since my mother has left the house few times due his violent behaviour and came back after promises from my father that he will leave the lady. He has accepted in from people that he has married twice.      At present, my mom has left the house. My father stays with the lady he claims is his wife. My mother left the house because one day she confronted with my father about this and he fought with her, (Physical and verbal abuse are normal in my house since we belong to the family where husband rules everyone and everything). this happened a year back so it has been a year since my father is staying with his second wife.    Before this he was staying at his second wife for few years but for property purpose, he requested my mother to come back and stay with him promising that he will break all ties with the lady though he did not.      all my relatives have accepted this lady as my father's second wife. currently my mother stays at her sister's place and finds it difficult to make ends meet. i stay with father since me and my mother have decided that i can be a witness in a legal case takes place. so yes, my father stays with his second wife and me. my brother stays with my mother. We take care of finances for her. since he has job, i have a job too and my mother also earns little via insurance business.      Just to see if this can help, my father within past year did accept in front an office from women's wing of CBI that he has married twice.      I am seeking the advice that can my mother file a case? if yes, what are her chances to win? what is the legal process you will advice? and if anyone can take this case, it would be helpful ? I am ready to pay the respective fees. Though we do not have big monetary support but i will pay the fees      I am writing this with a hope that i find a reliable lawyer who can help my mother. My father owns several properties and is financially well settled hence he has power of money with several friends at police and CBI level.      Regards,   Pratik",

The custody for child for Hindus is determined by Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 and Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956. HMGA 1956 has overriding effect on GWA 1890. An important provision in HMGA 1956 is Sec 13 which states that \u201cWelfare of minor to be paramount consideration\u201d. With that clause, the favourable clause 19 of GWA 1890 towards fathers for child custody has been overridden. In practical terms, it has meant that child custody can be more easily granted to women in interest of child\u2019s welfare. Now to evolve strategy for men for child custody, few things have to noted in laws: HMGA Sec 6 (a) gives custody to mother for child less than 5 years old. So it will be difficult (or maybe impossible) to fight for custody of child less than 5 years old if woman insists on custody. However, it is not impossible and that is the beauty or maybe unfortunate thing about child custody cases.    You can ask for visitation rights for court twice in a month."

In legal terms, child custody is the process of allotting a right to one of the parent to have over the other regarding their child either during or after the decree of divorce or judicial separation is passed.  The option available with you is to file a petition for restitution of conjugal rights under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act 1955(assuming you are a Hindu). Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act 1955 has been explained below for your understanding: Section 9. Restitution of conjugal rights - When either the husband or the wife has, without reasonable excuse, withdrawn from the society of the other, the aggrieved party may apply, by petition to the district court, for restitution of conjugal rights and the court, on being satisfied of the truth of the statements made in such petition and that there is no legal ground why the application should not be granted, may decree restitution of conjugal rights accordingly. Hence this is a legal way wherein court will direct your wife along with child to stay with you."

Unfortunately, my gift deed is not registered, but my parents signed in a 100rs stamp paper with 2 witnesses. Originally the property has purchased by my grandmother in 1982 and registered in SRO Vishakapatnam. but in 1999 the government has regularized lands in Vishakapatnam and issued new patta's in 2017.So my father made patta's on my name and my sister name in MRO office, but patta has given with same extent for both (Me and my sister) and didn't mention boundaries in the document.       Since I have been staying abroad(USA) and given my original patta document to my sister before leaving to USA 5 years before. My mother expired in 2018 and my father sickout after that. So that my sister took it as an advantage and converted Municiple taxes and power bills on her name and given all 3 shops for rents and made agreements.

Coming directly to the answers to the issues. 1) Whether you can get the divorce on the ground of adultery? YES, you can get the divorce on the ground of adultery, subject to the cogent proof you have. Its a ground under section 13(1) of hindu marriage act.   2)whether you can get the custody of the child, where you are currently unemployed? Maybe, As per the law child  below 6 years are to be under the guardianship of the mother. But, we can prove in the court that the lady is such as that the benefit of the child cant be assured. And if the child wants the guardianship can be decreed in your favour.   3)As per  the recent judgment of the supreme court which is Joseph shine vs union of india, the adultery law has been strucked down by the supreme court. so you cant sue the person on the charge of adultery. But, we still have many options where he can be held liable.  Hope that solves your query. YUGANSHU SHARMA ADVOCATE"

They raided my address and found a few Tatkal Tickets in my phone, which was then confiscated alongside with my computer, which I have not got back. I was under their custody for the night, only to be released on bail by the Junior Sessions Magistrate.       I had a single Live Ticket on which the journey was due. Under their threat, I confessed twelve other tickets on which the journey had been completed. I have also provided them with my account transaction statement, which mentions all of those payments. All the booked tickets only had the initial names i.e. only the first name of passengers. I was forced to get three of those travellers to their station, for their statements to be recorded. The statements depict how I levied a surcharge on the base price of the tickets. The only ambiguity I see over here is, that the IDs of these travellers which was recorded by the RPF had their full names, unlike the tickets.      I am aware that plea bargaining here will yield the quickest results for me. I am a young college student and have no criminal history. My concern is that I am looking forward to persuade my masters in Canada. However if I plead guilty over here, it will effectively be a criminal conviction which will bar me from the Canadian Visa, irrespective of the relevance and severity of the crime,       What options do I have over here? If I contest this case, what ground should I base my defence on? Do I have a chance to get a favourable verdict? If I contest the case, how much time should I expect for my case to be disposed off, an year, two years, three years? If I contest the case and lose, would the court enforce a stricter punishment that is imprisonment on me?       Also is the Chattisgarh High Court's 2004 verdict regarding the same binding on my case? It specifies how the RPF has no rights to register a FIR in such case. If that holds true, would I have to approach the High Court for a Quash Application, or this can brought up in the Sessions Court itself.      I seek your expert assistance over here.

Statements of your clients/travellers was recorded wherein they deposed that extra money was paid by them over the base price of ticket.  issues/Concerns behind query  Due to pendency of this criminal prosecution or subsequent conviction on merits or plea bargaining will lead to  difficulty in pursuing your further studies in abroad (Preferably Canada). Therefore you want to get out of this case by clean aquitted either by quashment of complaint or speedy disposal of trial (based on evidence) leading to your aquittial.   You sought opinion on merits as well.  Legal Opinion In the totality of facts I am of the considered opinion as under:  Offence is Under Section 143 of Railway Act, 1989. Triable by Judicial Magistrate First Class. Punishable by imprisonment for the term which may extend to maximum 3 years and minimum of 1 month (Can be waived assigning special reason by Court) or a fine of INR 5000/- (Hence this case would tried as Warrant Trial Ref.

As instant case is warrant case early escape can be made at the stage of framing of charges on complaint made or chargesheet or report submitted to court of JMFC by RPF or Complaint will be quashed by Hon'ble High Court when no prima facie offence is made out. Therefore before going upon merits or evidence of case we require to ascertain ingredients of offence u/s 143 of Railway Act, 1989. Therefore minute examination of provision is necessary  \"143.Penalty for unauthorised carrying on of business of procuring and supplying of railway tickets.\u2014 (1) If any person, not being a railway servant or an agent authorised in this behalf,\u2014 (a) carries on the business of procuring and supplying tickets for travel on a railway or from reserved accommodation for journey in a train; or (b) purchases or sells or attempts to purchase or sell tickets with a view to carrying on any such business either by himself or by any other person, he shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine which may extend to ten thousand rupees, or with both, and shall also forfeit the tickets which he so procures, supplies, purchases, sells or attempts to purchase or sell: Provided that in the absence of special and adequate reasons to the contrary to be mentioned in judgment of the court, such punishment shall not be less than imprisonment for a term of one month or a fine of five thousand rupees\"  On perusal of provision ingredients for offence is sale and purchase/ Supply and procurement of railway tickets with the object of carrying out business.Therefore while investigation RPF should establish the prima facie case against you with help of documents and witness that you have Made procurement or purchase and further made sales or supply to fulfil the motive of business.

You have made confessions to RPF. In these circumstances you cannot be discharged nor this prosecution can be quashed from High court u/s 482 of Cr.P.C.

On the other hand get issue a legal notice to them calling upon to pay compensation of Rs.2 lakhs towards mental torture and health hazards. The law is as follows: =========================================================================================== The Indian courts have been reluctant to restrain the employee from joining a competitor/other employer ========================================================================================  Non compete clause, it is prohibited under the Law of Contracts. ====================================================================================== Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act-1872 provides that \u201dEvery agreement by which anyone is restrained from exercising a lawful profession or trade or business of any kind, is to that extent void\u201d. Exception : One who sells goodwill of a business with a buyer to refrain from carrying on a similar business within specified local limits so long as the buyer, or any person derivingtitle to the goodwill from him, carries on a like business therein provided that such limits appear to the court reasonable, regard being had to the nature of business. Indian law is therefore very clear and strict on this point, any such non compete agreement shall not be binding on the parties and the same shall be null and void. By using the term void ab initio, for such type of agreements it has shown that it has kept such non compete clause in the agreements beyond consideration. Indian courts have also consistently refused to enforce post termination non compete clauses in employment contracts as \u201crestraint of trade\u201d is impermissible under section 27 of the Indian Contract Act-1872, and have held them as void and against the public policy because of their potential to deprive an individual of his or her fundamental right to earn a living. However considering the developed social, legal, and corporate circumstances, and the required confidentiality and the integrity of the employments, the judiciary has inclined its view towards giving some regard to the non compete agreements. In the case of \u2018Niranjan Shankar Golikari Vs the Century Spinning and Manufacturing Company Ltd.\u2019 , the Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court observed that-\u201crestraints or negative covenants in the appointment or contracts may be valid if they are reasonable\u201d. Further in one case - V.F.S. global services Pvt. Ltd Vs Mr. Suprit Roy, 2008(2) Bom CR 446, the Bombay High court established the principle that a restraint on the use of trade secrets during or after the cessation of employment does not tantamount to a \u201crestraint on trade\u201d under section 27 of the Act and therefore can be enforceable under certain circumstances. In the case of Mr. Diljeet Titus, Adv Vs Mr. Alfred A Adebare & Ors 2006(32)PTC 609 (Del), Delhi High court held that \u201cThe real test was the degree of employment control to determine whether it was a contract of service\u2026\u201d . Like these there are several other judgements of various High courts which have laid down certain tests or guidelines to check the validity and legality of imposition of restrictions on such non competing agreements. It shows that Indian courts may in certain circumstances enforce confidentiality agreements intended to protect an employer\u2019s proprietary rights.

To cope up with competition, the employers incur huge expenditure in imparting training to their employees for improving the quality of goods and services of the company. However, sometimes the employees leave their employment after honing the skills & improving the knowledge of the industry for better salary and incentives. The increasing rate of attrition subjects the employers not only to financial losses but also delays in completing the ongoing projects thereby directly impacting their goodwill & reputation in the market. Therefore, in order to safeguard their interest, employers have of late started to obtain an employment bond from their employees who are found suitable for training or skill development. Such employment bonds are agreements between the employer and employee wherein among other terms & conditions of the employment, an additional clause is incorporated which requires the employee to serve the employer compulsorily for a specific time period else refund the amount specified as bond value. The question that arises here is whether such a method to retain employees is effective, acceptable and enforceable under the law. This article discusses the enforceability of employment bond and the rights available to the employers and employees under the agreement in light of various court decisions. 1. Employment bond: need and enforceability? Generally before selecting employees for providing training or skill enhancement program, employers take necessary safeguard of conducting interviews, take assurances that employee will stick to complete the projects for which he is being trained and shall also train the other co-employees so that an effective and efficient work environment is created. However, employees still tend to leave for greener pastures and, therefore, it is increasingly becoming necessary for the employers to enter into an employment bond to safeguard their interests. If employee leaves the employment without serving the company for agreed time period, the employer is expected to suffer due to the undue delay in completing the work undertaken, which can ultimately affect its reputation/creditability in the market. To prevent such situations, the employer can compensate the loss incurred if a valid employment bond has been executed. Such bonds also deter the employees from committing any breach of the agreed terms and conditions. Now, the most pertinent question that arises here is whether the employment agreement with negative covenant is enforceable under Indian laws? The simple answer is yes. Such employment agreements with the negative covenant is valid and legally enforceable if the parties agree with their free consent i.e. without force, coercion, undue influence, misrepresentation and mistake. The courts in India have held in its various judgments that in the event of breach of contract by the employee, the employer shall be entitled to recover damages only if a considerable amount of money was spent on providing training or incurred other expenses for the employee. Further, the courts have been reluctant to restrain the employee from joining a competitor/other employer. The employment bond will not be enforceable if it is either one sided, unconscionable or unreasonable. Therefore, it is pertinent to be cautious while drafting the employment bond because it is mandatory that the conditions mentioned in the employment bond, including the compulsory employment period and amount of penalty are reasonable in order to be valid under the Indian law. The term \"reasonable\" is not defined under the legislation and, therefore, the meaning has to be determined on a case by case basis depending upon the issues involved and circumstances of the case. In general, the conditions stipulated in the contract should justify that it is necessary to safeguard the interest of the employer and to compensate the loss in the event of breach of contract. Further, the penalty or compulsory employment period stipulated in the contract should not be exorbitant to be considered as valid and to be regarded as reasonable. 2. Challenging the enforceability of employment bond The validity/enforceability of the employment bond can be challenged on the ground that it restrains the lawful exercise of trade profession or trade or business. As per section 27 of the Contract Act, 1872, any agreement in restraint of trade or profession is void. Therefore, any terms and conditions of the agreement which directly or indirectly either compels the employee to serve the employer or restrict them from joining competitor or other employer is not valid under the law. The employee, by signing a contract of employment, does not sign a bond of slavery and, therefore, the employee always has the right to resign the employment even if he has agreed to serve the employer for specific time period.1 However, the restraints or negative covenants in the agreement or contract may be valid if they are reasonable. For a restraint clause in an agreement to be valid under law, it has to be proved that it is necessary for the purpose of freedom of trade. For instance, if the employer is able to prove that the employee is joining the competitor to divulge its trade secrets then the court may issue an injunction order restricting the employment of the employee to protect the interests of the employer. Whenever an agreement is challenged on the ground of it being in restraint of trade, the onus is upon the party supporting the contract to show that the restraint is reasonably necessary to protect his interests.2 In order to execute a valid employment bond, the parties have to ensure that the following requisites have been complied: (i) the agreement has to be signed by the parties with free consent; (ii) the conditions stipulated must be reasonable; and (iii) the conditions imposed on the employee must be proved to be necessary to safeguard the interests of the employer. Further, the employment bond stipulating conditions such as to serve the employer compulsorily for a specific time period or penalty for incurring the expenses is in the nature of the indemnity bond and, therefore, such kind of employment bond has to be executed on a stamp paper of appropriate value in order to be valid and enforceable.3 3. Remedies available to employer and employee In the event of breach of employment bond, the employer might incur a loss and, therefore, may be entitled for compensation.4 However, the compensation awarded should be reasonable to compensate the loss incurred and should not exceed the penalty, if any, stipulated in the contract.5 Usually, the court determines the reasonable compensation amount by computing the actual loss incurred by the employer having regard to all circumstances of the case. Even if the bond stipulates payment of any penalty amount in the event of breach, it does not mean that the employer shall be entitled to receive the stipulated amount in full as compensation on the occurrence of such default; rather the employer shall be entitled only for reasonable compensation as determined by the court. While exploring alternate remedies available to the employer in the event of default by the employee, it would be interesting and worthwhile to discuss whether the employers are entitled to seek for reinstatement of their employee or obtain restraining order against the employee from joining any competitor/alternate employer because many such similar reliefs have been sought by the employers in various suits. The apex court, while dealing with similar query, has held that the specific performance action cannot be sought for breach of contract of personal service or bond6 and, therefore, the employer shall not be entitled to seek for reinstatement of their employees as relief in the event of breach of bond. In another matter, the apex court has held that it is not bound to grant an injunction in every case and an injunction to enforce a negative covenant would be refused if it would indirectly compel the employee to idleness or to serve the employer7 and, therefore, the courts are also reluctant to grant injunction against the employees restricting their employment with other employer unless it is necessary for the protection proprietary interests or trade secrets of the employer. As mentioned, the conditions stipulated in the employment bond should be reasonable in order to be valid and, therefore, even if unreasonable condition/clauses are stipulated in the contract such as imposing exorbitant duration of compulsory employment period or huge penalty upon the employee, the court shall award compensation only if it determines that the employer has incurred loss by such breach of contract. The court normally considers the actual expenses incurred by the employer, the period of service by the employee, conditions stipulated in the contract to determine the loss incurred by the employer to arrive at the reasonable compensation amount. For instance, in the case of Sicpa India Limited v Shri Manas Pratim Deb,8 the plaintiff had incurred expenses of INR 67,595 towards imparting training to the defendant for which an employment bond was executed under which the defendant had agreed to serve the plaintiff company for a period of three years or to make a payment of INR 200,000. The employee left the employment within a period of two years. To enforce the agreement the employer went to the court, which awarded a sum of INR 22,532 as compensation for breach of contract by the employee. It is crucial to note that though the bond stipulates a payment of INR 200,000 as compensation for breach of contract, the judge had considered the total expenses incurred by the employer and the employee's period of service while deciding the compensation amount. Since the defendant had already completed two years of service out of the agreed three year period, the judge divided the total expenses of INR 67,595 incurred by the plaintiff into three equal parts for three years period and awarded a sum of INR 22,532 as reasonable compensation for leaving the employment a year before the agreed time period. Similarly, the High Court of Andhra Pradesh in the case of Satyam Computers v Leela Ravichander,9had also reduced the compensation amount considering the period of service of the employee. Conclusion In view of the aforesaid discussions and various court decisions, the employment bond is considered to be reasonable as it is necessary to protect the interests of the employer. However, the restrains stipulated upon the employee in the said contract should be \"reasonable\" and \"necessary\" to safeguard the interests of the employer or else the validity of the bond may be questioned. The employees are always free to decide their employment and they cannot be compelled to work for any employer by enforcing the employment bond. The court can; however, issue order restricting the employment of the employee only if the said action is deemed necessary to safeguard the trade secrets/proprietary interest of the employer. In the event of breach of contract by the employee, the only remedy available to the employer is to obtain a reasonable compensation amount. The compensation amount awarded shall be based upon the actual loss incurred by the employer by such breach."

                "responder": "Kishan Dutt Kalaskar",
                "response-text": "Dear Sir, My answers are as follows: Medical documents are available for the disorders diagnosed in past 4 months. This includes ECG report, Ultra Sound report, physiologist meet, several prescriptions and medical bills. Ans: These are all reports and prescriptions only you must establish how such diseases prevented you to work in the company.  No recorded proof available for violation of basic rights, vulgar vocabulary used on the floor, continuous nagging and attempt to make stay uncomfortable through several instances (escalated to HR management in person or call, not on email) Ans: You must bring some oral evidence through your co-employees to prove harassment by your HR etc. Given all this, and the fact training happened for 3.5 months of the promised 6 months in offer letter, should we pay 60k or submit to their threat of sending legal notice? Ans: You may send legal notice. The rules of notice period are as follows: ======================================================================================== Is notice period (3 months) legal in India? It may help to think of a buyout agreement as a sort of \"prenuptial agreement\" between co-owners: It determines what will happen if your corporation's owners decide not to stay together 'til death do them part. The law provides remedies if a promise is breached or recognizes the performance of a promise as a duty. Every document signed in India is legal in India provided that: \u2022\tAdhere and comply within the jurisdiction of the law/s such labor law etc.. \u2022\tNot Forbidden By Law such as in IPC act 1860. \u2022\tIf Permitted It Would Not Defeat The Provisions Of Any Law (other subsidiary law such as FEMA, SEBI etc) \u2022\tDoes not Opposed To Public Policy. Conclusion: On the basis of above discussed, it can be easily understood that the ambit and scope of section 23 of the Indian contract act 1872, is vast and therefore the applicability of its provisions is subject to scrutiny by the court of the consideration and object of an agreement and the agreement itself. Therefore, in order to bring a case within the purview of section 23, it is necessary to show that the object of the agreement or consideration of the agreement or the agreement itself is unlawful. I'll keep it short and simple:   Either party - employer or employee can terminate the contract by giving sufficient notice or compensating accordingly. In such a case, employer is bound to release the employee without any fuss, assuming that either of the above two conditions are met.   So, if your organization doesn't allow you to buyout the notice period, please feel free to knock on the doors of the Indian judiciary. The following key issues should be highlighted: \u2022\tA 30 to 90-day notice period applies in order to terminate \u2018workmen\u2019 (as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947) \u2013 that is, employees whose role is not primarily supervisory, administrative or managerial) for convenience, with 15 days\u2019 pay due for every year worked. In the case of manufacturing units, plantations and mines with 100 or more workmen, termination for convenience requires prior government approval; in other sectors, it requires only government notification. \u2022\tTermination for cause does not include non-performance \u2013 it includes only behaviour which qualifies as misconduct. \u2022\tThe \u2018last in, first out\u2019 principle requires that the employer first terminate for convenience the last people to join the organisation in the same role. However, this requirement can be contracted out of. When hiring for the same role, workmen who were terminated for convenience should be given the opportunity to re-join the company. \u2022\tState laws generally provide for about 15 days of earned/regular leave a year. Employees also benefit from up to 10 days of sick leave and a possible 10 additional days of \u2018casual leave\u2019. This is generally more than what most organisations would ideally like to provide. \u2022\tMost state laws provide for \u2018casual leave\u2019 \u2013 the employee can opt not to come to work that day without applying for leave in advance. Many organisations find this disruptive. \u2022\tMost state laws restrict women from working at night; if women are to work at night, specific approval must be obtained. This exemption is granted only to limited business sectors (eg, IT sector). Further, the employer must offer door-to-door transport and meet some security-related requirements. \u2022\tMost state laws prescribe overtime for any hours worked beyond 48 hours in a week. However, this is seldom observed. \u2022\tIndian law regulates and in some cases prohibits the use of contract workers. To engage contract workers, the contractor must hold a licence and the employer must be registered as a \u2018principal employer\u2019. \u2022\tNon-compete agreements are not enforceable under Indian law, while non-solicitation clauses can be enforced only in limited ways. \u2022\tWhile the \u2018work for hire\u2019 principle applies under the Indian copyright regime, it does not apply under the Indian patent regime; employees must thus provide formal assignments. \u2022\tIndian laws require employers to maintain a plethora of registers and notices. Compliance with such requirements is difficult and full compliance is rare.  What do you consider unique to those doing business in your country? Some of the points mentioned above are unique to India. In addition, while Indian employment law is mainly federal in nature, most states have a Shops and Establishments Act. These statutes are similar, but not identical. Further, some states have been permitted to make amendments to central laws, with which are thus applicable in a different manner in such states. Is there any general advice you would give in the employment area? India is heavily regulated in the employment arena. Legal assistance should be obtained with regard to employment contracts and employment terms of service. Practical advice should be sought on best practices and common practices, so that policies are HR friendly and legally compliant. Advice should also be obtained on areas where compliance is difficult, so that employers can adopt positions that balance convenience against risk. Emerging issues/hot topics/proposals for reform Are there any noteworthy proposals for reform in your jurisdiction? As part of the objective to make it easier to do business in India, the government has proposed that the federal labour laws be revised and possibly amalgamated into two or three labour codes. If this is accomplished, the filing requirements will be streamlined. Amendments have also been proposed to some federal laws relating to factories and the use of apprentices. There has been no progress taking these initiatives forward and it appears unlikely that the government will do so.  Key amendments to law in recent months include a substantial change to the Maternity Benefit Act 1961 through the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act 2016. Key features of this amendment include: \u2022\tan increase in paid time off for eligible female employees from 12 weeks to 26 weeks in case a female employee has fewer than two children. If she has two or more children, she is entitled to 12 weeks\u2019 leave; \u2022\tthe introduction of the concepts of a 'commissioning mother' and an 'adopting mother', which widens the scope of the law. Such mothers are entitled to 12 weeks\u2019 leave; \u2022\tthe option to work from home once the paid maternity leave period has ended, based on an agreement with the employer; and \u2022\trequiring an establishment with 50 or more employees to set up a cr\u00e8che facility. Overall, the amendments are progressive in nature. From an employer\u2019s perspective, there will be greater financial implications due to the increased maternity leave payment and also the benefits to be paid to the new categories of eligible female employees.  In December 2016 the Employee\u2019s State Insurance Act 1948 was amended, increasing the salary or wages threshold for coverage of an employee to Rs21,000 (approximately $309) per month from the previous wage cap of Rs15,000 (approximately $221) per month. The act applies to commercial establishments and provides for social security insurance for employees in case of sickness. The amendment has led to higher employee coverage under the law. What are the emerging trends in employment law in your jurisdiction? After decades of the government and courts adopting a somewhat socialist mind set, there has been a shift to a more pragmatic, business-friendly approach. The old approach, which focused on unskilled and daily wage workers, has given way to a focus on India\u2019s growing service industry. There is heightened interest in rewriting the employment laws to make them more business friendly. India\u2019s newest employment law on the prevention of sexual harassment is also leading to an increased number of sexual harassment complaints and additional processes to be followed. Another important aspect is the move towards e-governance in the labour law sector. A new web portal launched by the government provides users with a unique labour identification number, facilitating online registration, the filing of self-certified, simplified and single online returns for specific federal laws, and a transparent labour inspection scheme on risk-based criteria. Some concessions have also been provided for start ups in terms of employment law compliances. The employment relationship Country specific laws What laws and regulations govern the employment relationship? Some states require that the employer prepare an appointment order for new hires, although this is seldom observed. There are no direct laws dealing with probation on a general basis in India, which is, however, a common practice. The (federal) Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act1946 (which is applicable to workmen), provides for a probationary period of up to three months. Certain states have built in the probation concept indirectly into their local laws, which ranges from three to six months. Ideally, a probation period should not exceed 240 days, as several statutory social welfare laws apply to employees who have worked for such period. The Industrial Disputes Act 1947 (applicable to workmen), prescribes that if certain terms of service change, notice must be given to the employee. It also prescribes requirements for termination for convenience, including notice and compensation. Who do these cover, including categories of worker? There are essentially two types of employer and two types of employee. Employers are either: \u2022\t\u2018establishments\u2019 \u2013 a term which encompasses all employers; or \u2022\t\u2018factories\u2019 \u2013 a term which typically encompasses manufacturing units. Mines are sometimes covered along with factories. Employees are either: \u2022\t\u2018employees\u2019 \u2013 a term which covers all employees in any kind of role; or \u2022\t\u2018workmen\u2019 (as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947) \u2013 that is, employees whose primary role is not supervisory, managerial or administrative.  In addition, certain state laws may exclude senior management employees from their scope of application.  Misclassification Are there specific rules regarding employee/contractor classification? Indian law regulates and in some cases prohibits the use of contract workers. To engage contract workers, the contractor must hold a licence and the employer must be registered as a \u2018principal employer\u2019.  Contracts Must an employment contract be in writing? Except in states which require an appointment order, Indian law does not explicitly require that an employment contract be in writing, although this is the typical practice followed by most employers. Are any terms implied into employment contracts? Certain legal terms are implied in the employment contract. A duty of care, a right to privacy and a duty to maintain confidentiality are implied in the employment contract. Are mandatory arbitration/dispute resolution agreements enforceable? Yes. How can employers make changes to existing employment agreements? Under Indian contract law, a contract requires the consent of both parties. Thus, the employer cannot unilaterally make changes to the employment agreement. Typically, compensation terms are set out in an annex to the agreement, which should provide that these will be subject to change from time to time. Standard terms of employment \u2013 such as working hours, vacation, benefits, security procedures and disciplinary procedures \u2013 are normally set out in the employment terms of service, rather than in the employment contract. The employment contract should state that these terms of service apply to the employee and will be subject to change from time to time. An employer cannot change specified service conditions (eg, compensation, grade classification and customary concessions) for \u2018workmen\u2019 (as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947) without providing 21 days\u2019 prior statutory notice and notice to the labour authorities. This should be considered when implementing changes to an employment agreement. Foreign workers Is a distinction drawn between local and foreign workers? A significant difference between local and foreign employees is evident in the law on provident funds, which is a type of pension. The threshold to qualify, the manner of deduction and the benefits are different for foreign employee, and differ further depending on whether the country of origin has a social service agreement with India. There are no other substantive distinctions between local and foreign employees. Recruitment Advertising What are the requirements relating to advertising positions? Under the Employment Exchange (Compulsory Notification of Vacancies) Act, 1959, if the state so requires, a private sector establishment with 25 or more employees must notify vacancies to specific employment exchanges. However, this is seldom observed. Background checks What can employers do with regard to background checks and inquiries in relation to the following: (a) Criminal records? While it is possible to conduct criminal background checks, this is extremely difficult in practice because criminal records are not digitised and are not consolidated nationwide. Accordingly, where a criminal background check must be carried out, this is typically done at the police station with jurisdiction over the employee\u2019s current place of residence or anywhere that he or she has lived for a reasonable period. (b) Medical history? Employees\u2019 medical histories cannot be accessed easily, since these are not digitised and there is no repository of medical records. Employee consent is required to disclose medical records to the employer. However, some employers require employees to undergo medical checks and have the diagnostic centre send the report directly to the employer. Subject to certain specific restrictions (eg, pre-employment testing for HIV is not permitted), there is no prohibition against this practice under Indian law.  (c) Drug screening? Indian law does not prohibit drug screening. (d) Credit checks? An individual is entitled to obtain information on his or her credit rating. The employer can also access this information, with the employee\u2019s permission and on providing necessary proof of identity. Access to credit rating information is more common in banks and financial institutions. (e) Immigration status? Indian law does not specifically require an employer to check the immigration status of a foreigner. Indian law does not prevent the employer from checking whether a foreign employee holds the necessary visa to work in India. If a foreign individual on an employment visa wishes to change employment to another company, he or she must leave India and apply afresh for a visa. The only exception is where the foreigner is changing jobs between a registered holding company and its subsidiaries or vice versa, or between subsidiaries of a registered holding company. In such case the foreigner may not need to leave India, provided that he or she fulfils specific criteria, including obtaining prior government approval for the change in employment. (f) Social media? There is no bar against conducting background checks through social media. (g) Other? The most common background checks undertaken are of educational qualifications. The employee must consent to this and the employer (or an outsourced provider) will then write to the relevant institution requesting confirmation. The institution may charge a fee for providing this information. Most institutions have a procedure in place in this regard.  Wages and working time Pay Is there a national minimum wage and, if so, what is it? There is no national minimum wage. However, the central and state governments can issue notifications on minimum wages in specific industries. The federal government has set the recommended minimum wage to Rs176 per day and advised state governments to implement the same. Are there restrictions on working hours? By and large, working up to nine hours a day is permitted, with a weekly limit of 48 to 50 hours. There are laws that restrict women from working at night (between 8:00pm and 6:00am). Some states also have a maximum number of hours of overtime that can be worked.  Hours and overtime What are the requirements for meal and rest breaks? Most state laws provide for a break of 30 to 60 minutes after four to five hours of work. In practice, it is typical to provide a one-hour lunch break in an eight-hour day.  How should overtime be calculated? Overtime is usually calculated at twice the rate of normal wages. State law defines what the term \u2018wages\u2019 covers; this typically includes basic wages plus normal allowances, but excludes any bonus component.  What exemptions are there from overtime? There are no exemptions from paying overtime. However, the overtime provisions are seldom observed \u2013 generally, companies do not pay overtime when employees stay late to complete their work. It is recommended that employers pay overtime at least when employees are required by the nature of the assignment to work overtime \u2013 for example, call centre employees. Is there a minimum paid holiday entitlement? Yes. This varies from state to state, but is generally about 15 days. Most states prescribe up to 10 days of sick leave and some states prescribe another entitlement of up to 10 days of casual leave. In addition, most states prescribe about 10 days of public holidays; four to five of these are mandatory national and state holidays, while the remainder are chosen by the employer from a larger list provided by the state. What are the rules applicable to final pay and deductions from wages? Final pay must be made within two days of the date of termination where the employee\u2019s services are terminated by the employer. In case of the employee\u2019s resignation, the final pay-out can be made as part of the company\u2019s normal payment cycle. Deductions are permitted from an employee\u2019s wages, but only for specified reasons (eg, on account of fines, deductions for damage to or loss of goods expressly entrusted to the employee and recovery of loans or advances). Deductions are generally permitted only up to 50% of the employee\u2019s wages."

SECTION 211, IPC: False charge of offence made with intent to injure.\u2014Whoev\u00ader, with intent to cause injury to any person, institutes or causes to be instituted any criminal proceeding against that person, or falsely charges any person with having committed an offence, knowing that there is no just or lawful ground for such proceeding or charge against that person, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both; and if such criminal proceeding be instituted on a false charge of an offence punishable with death, 1[imprisonment for life], or imprisonment for seven years or upwards, shall be punishable with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine. So, you should consider filing a counter  complaint  with the police officer with whom such complaint has been lodged or to his Senior police officer, who is empowered file a case against your ex wife for providing false and concocted information to the police. You can also consider filing a petition under section 482 CRPC but it it should only be done, once the FIR is lodged. Filing a petition for quashing in high court under the above mentioned section without any formal FIR would not be of any use to you. In case there is no FIR lodged by the police against your parents or yourself, there is no need to file quashing petition. Once her case are closed as false, you can file a suit for malicious prosecution against her and claim damages from her. Simultaneously you can also file a complaint against her for criminal defamation."

Ans On the ground of DESERTION you can file it. it is defined as follows:13(1)(ib) see last line. Section 13 in The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 13 Divorce. \u0097 (1) Any marriage solemnised, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, may, on a petition presented by either the husband or the wife, be dissolved by a decree of divorce on the ground that the other party\u0097 [(i) has, after the solemnisation of the marriage, had voluntary sexual intercourse with any person other than his or her spouse; or]  [(ia) has, after the solemnisation of the marriage, treated the petitioner with cruelty; or] [(ib) has deserted the petitioner for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition; or] 2. whats is better way for divorce either i file sec 9 if it will help me or can file directly divorce case . Ans: Directly file divorce case. 3 If i file sec 9 first then can i convert it in to divorce case before decision after some time if she dont wants to come Ans: Both sections are quite opposite to each other as such your case may not stand if you file under section 9 and then to section 13. I have read more than 10,000 judgments and prepared Head notes which are published in many law journals. Further I worked a judicial officer for 20 years. Out of my experience I say that you have to file divorce case directly. Section 9 in The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 9 Restitution of conjugal rights. \u0097 When either the husband or the wife has, without reasonable excuse, withdrawn from the society of the other, the aggrieved party may apply, by petition to the district court, for restitution of conjugal rights and the court, on being satisfied of the truth of the statements made in such petition and that there is no legal ground why the application should not be granted, may decree restitution of conjugal rights accordingly. 8 [ Explanation. \u0097Where a question arises whether there has been reasonable excuse for withdrawal from the society, the burden of proving reasonable excuse shall be on the person who has withdrawn from the society."

Previously in the State of Maharashtra, India, a non-agriculturist could not acquire agricultural land without the prior approval of the Collector.   A non-agriculturist can now buy agricultural land  http://sahakarsutra.blogspot.in/2016/04/a-non-agriculturist-can-now-buy.html Previously in the State of Maharashtra, India, a non-agriculturist could not acquire agricultural land without the prior approval of the Collector. On 1 January 2016, an amendment was made to the existing law to allow a non-agriculturist to acquire agricultural land subject to certain conditions.WHAT WAS THE LAW BEFORE THE AMENDMENT?Section 63 of the Maharashtra Tenancy and Agricultural Land Act, 1948 (\u201cMTAL\u201d) barred a sale, gift, exchange, lease or mortgage (in which possession is delivered) of agricultural land to a non-agriculturist or to any other persons holding land in excess of two-third of the ceiling area as determined under the Maharashtra Agricultural Lands (Ceiling on Holdings) Act, 1961, without the prior approval of the Collector.Consequentially, it became very difficult for a non-agriculturist to acquire agricultural land as the permission of the Collector or any other officer authorised by the State Government was required in advance. There was no guarantee that every applicant would receive this permission and in addition, the permission so granted was conditional. If any of the conditions on which the permission was granted was contravened, then the land so acquired could be forfeited by the Collector. This situation led to the need for an amendment to the existing law. WHAT IS THE AMENDMENT?The amendment, which came into force from 1 January 2016, was made in the form of adding a sub-section to Section 63 of the MTAL, whereby the following lands would be excluded from the purview of Section 63 of the MTAL:Land situated within the limits of a Municipal Corporation; orLand situated within the limits of a Municipal Council; orLand situated within the jurisdiction of Special Planning Authority; orLand situated within the jurisdiction of New Town Development Authority; orAny land allocated for residential, commercial, industrial or any other non-agricultural use as proposed in the draft/final Regional plan or Town Planning Scheme prepared under the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966.In short, a non-agriculturist can now acquire agricultural land for non-agricultural purpose (residential/commercial/industrial), if such land falls under any of the five exceptions to Section 63 of the MTAL as mentioned above.Time frame for using the land for non-agricultural purpose: It is imperative for the person who acquires the agricultural land for residential/commercial/industrial or any other non-agricultural purpose to put the land to such use within a period of 5 years from the date on which the land was transferred to him. If the period of 5 years lapses, then the Collector may grant an extension of another 5 years after payment of non-utilization charges which will be determined at the rate of 2% of the market value of such land per annum. Sale of land by the purchaser: If the purchaser or subsequent purchaser does not utilise the agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes and wants to sell the land prior to the expiry of the 10 year period, then the Collector may allow him to sell the land, provided the purchaser or subsequent purchaser pays the non-utilization charges to the Collector and the land so sold should be used for non-agricultural purposes only. The period for putting the land to non-agricultural use by the person purchasing the land will be the remaining period which is left unutilized by the person selling the land out of the specified period of 10 years. Additionally, the person selling the land will also have to deposit 25% of the market value of the land with the Collector. Collector will resume the land: If the purchaser or any subsequent purchaser does not use the land for non-agricultural purposes within a period of 5 years or within the period of 10 years upon payment of non-utilization charges, then the Collector shall resume the land after issuing one month\u2019s notice to the purchaser or subsequent purchaser as the case may be. The land so acquired by the Collector will vest with the Government free from all encumbrances. Option to the original owner to buy the land: The land so resumed by the Collector will be offered to the original owner on the same terms and conditions as it was sold by him. The original owner will have the right of first refusal. This right will have to be exercised by the original owner within a period of 90 days from the date of receipt of the offer. If the land is accepted by the original owner, then he will have to deposit the amount within a further period of 90 days. If he fails to exercise the right within a period of 90 days or if he fails to deposit the amount within a period of 90 days, then the land will be auctioned by the Collector.Auction of land: The land so auctioned shall be used for purposes mentioned in the draft/final Development plan or Regional plan or Town Planning scheme. The proceeds of the auction will be remitted to the purchaser or subsequent purchaser as the case may be, within a period of 90 days from the receipt of such auction proceeds. The amount paid to the purchaser or subsequent purchaser will be equal to the price at which he purchased the land. Thus, the amendment has eased the law as far as purchase of agricultural land by a non-agriculturist is concerned. What is commendable is the manner in which the government has achieved such a change where on the one hand fertile agricultural lands will continue to be governed by Section 63 of the MTAL but on the other hand, certain lands have excepted from this Section in order to make room for development without involving the burdensome process of obtaining approval in advance from the Collector."

        "query-text": "I got married in couple of years back as per Muslim sharia law (given meher on same day of marriage) and blessed with two kids, from past 3 years my marital life was quite disturbed as my ex-wife was addicted to phone/internet/social networking leaving behind leading the normal life with no attention towards kids, there are many other facts involved. In 2015 I was shocked to come across the facts about my ex-wife having affair with her own maternal brother and crossed all the limits which any husband on earth can accept, I discussed this matter with Mufti and pronounced divorced to her as per Muslim sharia law (fulfill the maintenance requirements) and got divorce certificate from concerned department and we also furnished the notice to take back her items and I was taking care of child expenses.   After 2 months of my divorce she with her own father and step mother filed a false 498A case against my parents, brother sister and uncle. During this course my family were out for to attend family function and horrible incident happened at my house valuables things has been stolen, damaged has been made to property and burnt my house from inside. Soon after this incident an FIR has been logged on behalf of us by area PS SI and my ex-wife and her associates where the prime suspect and later we came to know the direct involvement of my ex-wife, her own mother, and her step father with some of their associates when she visits my house with her step father and threaten us and said earlier they has burnt the house from inside and now they will do it from outside. But surprisingly their names has not been mentioned in FIR and no action has been taken till date.   However after few months to hide above incident false complaint has been made by my ex-wife with her mother, step father and associates (including local leaders) on my father (who is a senior citizen) and mother stating that \u201cMy parents have kept passports of my ex-wife and kids which has valid USA stamping till 2018 and asking my ex-wife to accept divorce than only they return the passports\u201d \u2013    [Few facts I want to bring into notice here which was totally ignored while investigation:    Why should my parents will keep passports as if my ex-wife flew abroad we will be easily out from false 498A case.   I am already divorced with divorce certificate in hand, asking for acceptance from ex-wife is nowhere related.    I had valid US visa stamping till 2014, how can she being on dependent visa holds valid visa till 2018   She herself holds the possession of passports as after few days of burnt incident, she posted on her Facebook page that she is on airport and travelling to Dubai.]   This matter was directly being handled by area Ex-SHO (circle) who is now additional CI and when my father visits area PS he has been wrongly treated and impartial behavior has been shown by SHO. He got very scared and fell ill after this incident as he is BP and Heart patient, very often visits of police with same SI (who handled the burn and theft investigation of my house) started at my house and also phone calls has been made to my father, brother and uncle to come and do settlement (demanding huge amount) in 498A case.one day they took my mother with my brother to police station and keep her in custody till 11pm in the night, seeing this all strange behavior of police My mother has given notice to higher authorities and as soon as notice has been furnished police has raided my father workshop situated in different zone and took his younger brother to police station with hand cuffed.

For the present you should arrange to come out of all her false cases and then plan to file counter cases including defamation cases for malicious prosecution. 4) If we have some strong genuine evidence which includes her adult chat and obscene pictures and video calls over skype/viber etc with her boyfriend from the phone she used which I have given to her, Can any action been taken against them as currently they are trying to manipulate evidence against us and threatening my parents to put false cybercrime complaint. On the basis of the said evidences, you may lodge a complaint against her under section 497 IPC for the adultery offences, but this can be lodged agaisnt the adulterer only and not agaisnt her though this will certainly make an impact. 5) In case bail rejected and custody granted by court, what other options I have to protect my father/family.

                "response-text": "Hello, As for common grounds of divorce, you have cruelty, adultery, desertion/abandonment (two years in India; three in Texas) and unsoundness of mind. This is based on a comparison of section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act and chapter 6, subtitle C, title 1 of the Texas Family Code. As for my advice to you, please read on.   First things first, you should strongly consider initiating divorce proceedings in India as opposed to Texas. This is based on the fact that you were married in India which continues to be your country of domicile and the jurisdiction with the closest contact with the dispute. The Hindu Marriage Act obviously governs you. More importantly, it is the jurisdiction that is likely to give you the most amount of grief if your wife sets her mind to it.    You see, enforcing a Texan decree \u2013 even in case of a contested, \u201cfault\u201d divorce \u2013 could be very time consuming and difficult in India for you. On the other hand, it would be relatively easy to resist any attempt by your wife to bring fresh divorce proceedings in Texas before or after an Indian decree in your favour (and she may never do that to begin with for myriad reasons). This opinion is based on a survey of Indian and Texan cases including Ashfaq v. Ashfaq, 467 S.W.3d 539 (Tex. App. 2015).   Any attempt to initiate fresh proceedings in Texas after an Indian court has ordered the marriage dissolved should come unstuck. The wife will have to show either of two things: (1) Indian court did not have jurisdiction or (2) the divorce proceedings in India were attended by lack of due process. This is a very tall ask that your wife should have a very hard time with. The matter will in all likelihood be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. You will have to get an expert to depose in the Texan court as to the relevant contents of Indian law (as per Tex.R. Evid. 203).   This is how the whole thing will play out:    You will file a divorce petition in India under the Hindu Marriage Act on the ground of mental cruelty among other things. If you have proof of actual adultery then that could be a ground in and of itself. You may or may not be able to convince your wife to part amicably during the pendency of said proceeding. If she comes around to your position, the matter will end there amicably. Otherwise you will eventually get your divorce (presuming you have enough evidence to sustain your petition). After the matter concludes in your favour she may not pursue the matter further \u2013 or at least not in Texas (on account of legal expenses, familiarity, etc.) If she initiates something in Texas you can have it thrown out on the ground of want of jurisdiction as described above.    I will need to know more to give you more specific advice, including info relating to your current living arrangement and properties in Texas. Hope that answers your question. Follow-up questions welcome."

        "query-text": "Dear experts,      I got married in Jan 2017, and by grace of the lord blessed with a baby boy in Mar 2018. In April 2018, wife moved to her paternal home saying that she'll be back within 15-20 days. In my culture infant first travel should be there to his/her maternal grandparents home. To which i agreed whole heartedly. Current month is Sep 2018 and she hasn't came back yet. Since May 2018 i have been trying to get her and my child back home - to which she wanted me to fulfill conditions like I should not carry my relations with my younger brothers and they shouldn't be allowed in Home, Get my property signed in her name and deposit certain lakhs of money in her bank account. These are non-sensical condition to which no man would ever agree, I made multiple attempts to get her understand that whatever i have is yours and not to make this kind of conditions. To which she responded that she will pull me and my family in court. I am suspecting a false dowry or DV case. I have started to record the calls of her to get evidences but i have only around 10 calls on which she repeatedly attacked/abused me and my family. After all these happened - i came to a conclusion that unfortunately this relationship is destined to be doomed.    I am looking for my options and rights. But reading internet makes me wonder if there is any justice to the Men at all. Having said that, i appeal to expert's better sense of judgement to educate me on below:      1) I have a property of around 35 L, & if this relationship that i have with my wife goes to court - I will need money. For which i may need to sell that land. Can she get a stay order and limit my option of having money to fight her allegation   2) I am concerned like all of you blessed with children - for my little child, I don't want to be a person to separate a child from his mother nor do I want to live without him. I am 100% sure that counselling will not help in my situation and narrow mindedness of the person whom, i refer to as my wife, is not letting her to understand the path to our mutual future. What would you suggest?   3) Father of my wife and her brother had a case registered against them from her brother's wife, - hiss wife was ill-treated and thrown out. To my knowledge the case is still in the court. Had i known this before - i would have never agreed to step inside their home. But what's done is done. Can this be utilized in my situation?      Looking forward to all your guidance in this matter. Thank you very much for patiently reading this. And thank you in advance for your suggestions and help.",

Can my wife or her family file a false 498a (dowry) case against me? What are the indications that a wife or her family can file 498a?  A. There are some indicators which are listed at: http://www.geocities.com/gorky_maksim/pages/assessrisk.htm Q. Neither I nor any of my relatives demanded or have taken any dowry. Can she still file 498a? A. Yes. Any Indian wife and her relative can file 498a on her husband, his parents, sisters, brothers, grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins, wives of brothers, and other relatives. 498a (dowry harassment case) leads to arrest without any verification or investigation.  Q. I have given a huge amount, say Rs. 5 lacs, to my wife or her parents by cheque. Can she still file 498a?  A. Yes. No investigation is done before 498a is filed and arrest warrants are issued without investigation.  Q. My parents never stayed with us. Can she still file 498a against them? A. Yes. Q. My wife or her family is threatening to file 498a and they are very abusive. What should I do?  A. Safeguard yourself, your parents and your relatives. 1) Be very polite in all circumstances. Record all conversations (voice, chat, email, letters, etc.) with those threatening and keep the originals in a safe place. Never produce the originals before anyone, not even before your lawyer. You can buy Olympus W-10 voice recorder, which costs about Rs.4500. You can also buy a telephone recorder. 2) Write a complaint to your nearest police station, detailing about blackmailing, her false allegations and her unscrupulous behavior. And request in your complaint to make her stop the threats and abuses immediately.  3) File RCR (Restitution of Conjugal Rights). Remember to include conditions that she should agree on before she starts living with you again.  4) Collect evidence to prove that you have neither demanded dowry or have taken it anytime. 5) Collect evidence to prove that she moved out of the bond of marriage for no apparent reason. 6) If she does not already know, make sure that she does not come to know that any of your family members is an NRI.  7) Don't remain home during weekends and holidays. Have proofs of where you were. For instance, if you were in a mall, have a credit card transaction in that mall and keep the copy of that transaction.  More FAQ\u2019s on request. Q. I think that I should go for divorce instead. Is it a good idea? A. Don't make the mistake of filing for divorce. You will land up in a lot of legal problems. Apply for divorce only after you get RCR in your favor or after you get an ex parte decree on your RCR or mental cruelty is as extreme as mentioned in http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/qrydisp.asp?tfnm=28609  Q. I'm very worried about my parents. What should I do to protect them? A. Disown them legally: ask your family members to give legal notice by way of affidavit in two newspapers. Ask them to produce the newspapers before the Circle Inspector and Investigating Officer before and when they come to arrest them. If your family members are still arrested, produce the newspapers at the time of applying for anticipatory/ regular bail.  Show up a smiling face to them. Your happy face will provide them the strength.  Q. My wife or her family are demanding money, joint property, joint account, separate accommodation, jewels, etc. and threaten, directly or indirectly, that they will file 498a if their demands are not met. What should I do?  A. Don't meet their unreasonable demands. It usually doesn't help. It will rob you of your hard-earned money that you need to spend on lawyers later. If you lose it now, you will not have anything to fight your case later in court and you'll become almost a bonded labor.  If you still need to pay them money, pay it as an explicit loan and only by cheque so that you have a record of the transaction.  Q. We went to the police, but they didn't write down what I stated verbally. What is the solution?  A. Simple. Write a complain letter yourself and submit the same in police station and get \"received stamp\" on xerox copy. If the police refuse to give a stamped copy, address your complaint letter to the \"police officer in-charge, local area\" and mention at the end of the letter that it is CC'ed to the SP. Then submit it to police. They are bound to take that and act on it. If they still do not give you a stamped copy, send it to the police by registered post and retain the acknowledgement. Q. I fear that if the police take any action on my complaint, my wife will lodge 498a immediately? Should I still submit the complaint?  A. Yes. Simply tell the police not to act on it. Even if they say they will act on it, they will not (99.99%). Q. When station in-charge of police station does not register the case, what can I do?  A. You have the below options. 1) Try to get the reason for not registering the complaint in written. 2) Approach SP of district.  3) Approach media. 4) Approach local heavyweights, NGOs, human rights activists, etc.  5) If any of the above does not work or you do not want to take these approaches, then the last and final solution will be to approach the court. Please read the judgment below which clearly states what you can do if police does not register your FIR. THE HON'BLE MR.MARKANDEY KATJU, THE CHIEF JUSTICE AND THE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE F.M.IBRAHIM KALIFULLA W.A. No. 401 of 2005 6 . In our opinion, if it is alleged that a crime has been committed and some one goes to file an F.I.R ., and either the F.I.R. is not lodged at the police station, or, having been lodged, it is alleged that proper investigation is not being done by the police, then the remedy of the complainant is to make an application under section 156(3) Cr.P.C. before the Magistrate mentioning all these facts, and it is open to the Magistrate to direct the police to lodge the FIR and/or to do a proper investigation of the alleged crime. Q. Is there anyway 498a can be averted at police station?  A. Yes. By effective bribing, 498a can be averted in police station permanently. But, if she has contacts, then it may not be possible. Q. I want to discuss my case with someone. What are the helpline numbers?  A. Below are the helpline numbers of volunteers. At these numbers, you can get help and counseling for pre-498a and post-498a cases.

What is considered as streedhan? Does it include the items that I or my parents gifted to her during or after the wedding ceremony?  A. Whatever is given to the wife (as gift) at the time of marriage and even after the marriage by either side is a part of streedhan. It also includes the articles which she has purchased (from her earnings) after the marriage.  However, the articles gifted to the husband from either side are not a part of streedhan. For example, clothes, rings, watches, etc. gifted to husband at the time of marriage are not a part of streedhan and she cannot claim that. Also, the money she spent to run household cannot be claimed by her.  Q. You demanded money to meet some emergency. Will it be called dowry?  A. No. A demand for money on account of some financial stringency or for meeting some urgent domestic expenses or for purchasing manure cannot be termed as a demand for dowry.  Q. Does the expenditure by the women side on marriage/engagement functions can be claimed by them before or during divorce?  A. No. Q. My wife lies that some or all of the items that are a part of streedhan are still with me. What should I do?  A. Collect evidence to prove that she is lying and that the items are with her. Q. My wife has filed a complaint against me in Women Cell stating that some or all of the items that are part of streedhan are still with me. What should I do?  A. In the Women Cell, you ask for the evidence, such as bills, photographs, etc, that proves that the items stated by her were indeed a part of streedhan. Return to your wife only those items for which she could provide evidence. Don't forget to get a signed document from her stating that the items have been returned to her. Keep all the bills, etc with yourself. If she submits any false bills, you can file a case under section IPC 420 against her. Q. Is it mandatory to make any commitments in Women Cell? A. No. Instead you should avoid saying you will live or will NOT live with her. If the women's cell tries to corner you, simply say that first your wife should stop threatening you and then you'll decide. You can also request women's cell to tell your wife that if she has any problems with the matrimony she is free to go to the family court and seek necessary CIVIL remedies. She should not convert that into a false CRIMINAL case.  Q. I know that my wife is going to file 498a against me and my relatives? Can I apply for anticipatory bail now?  A. You can apply for anticipatory bail only after your case goes into CAW cell. Q. Should I obtain Anticipatory Bail or should I wait until the FIR is lodged and obtain a regular bail?  A. Well it depends. Anticipatory bail costs significantly more than a regular bail. An anticipatory bail could cost you Rs 25,000/ and upwards whereas a regular bail would cost somewhere around 3000/-. If you obtain an anticipatory bail you never have to go to jail whereas for getting a regular bail you may get jailed first and then your lawyer applies for a regular bail and if the application is accepted, you get you out of jail. So it is up to you to decide whether you go for an AB or a regular bail. Moreover for obtaining an anticipatory bail you may have to prove in front of the judge that you are expecting a FIR to be lodged against you. Q. My wife has filed complaint against me and family. The FIR is not yet filed. It is at complaint stage. Police has called me to police station what should I do?  A. One of the common mistakes most 498a victims do is they go the police station not knowing that 498a is already filed. As soon as they walk in, they get arrested. So, better, send your lawyer to find the details. We have heard that bribing the police to get info about FIR works well. As soon as the FIR is registered, go underground and apply for Anticipatory Bail. Going underground doesn't harm your case. Q. My wife complaint against me under 498a? What should I do?  A. First, get bail application in court. If the police couldn't arrest you, do not surrender to the police. Second, keep collecting evidence. You have to create your evidence for innocence. Start to counter charge them and start making your story. Start writing letters to the President, the Prime Minister, media, human rights organizations, etc telling them of the misuse of the law. Q. I am an NRI and my wife has filed a FIR for dowry harassment under section 498a. Now, they say they have informed CBI and Interpol. Can they get me extradited?  A. The procedures involved in extradition are too complex and many murder accused have not got extradited. So, the chance of an extradition proceedings starting for 498a accused is nill. So, rest assured that this entire thing is to harass and confuse you. Q. I am a NRI and my wife went back to India and filed false 498a against me and my family. What should I do?  A. File a divorce petition in the place where you currently reside (provided you are eligible to file a petition based on the local laws). Get anticipatory bail or bail depending on the current situation for your parents in India. After you obtain your divorce get it legalized in India. If your false 498a case does not get quashed easily file counter cases against her for forgery and defamation etc to make your case stronger and for a possible quick settlement. Q. Can she oppose my bail application in court?  A. Not directly. It is only the state counsel who can be heard in opposing the bail application (The citation if os M.Cr.C.No.507 of 2006, Dated 05/05/2006). Her lawyer can also make a representation on her behalf. Q. My wife filed a false 498a case against me. Should I only defend myself or should I become offensive?  A. It is said that offense is the best defense. File a case under Cr.P.C. 227 stating that the 498a case filled by your wife is false. If you have enough proofs, or if she does not have enough proof to substantiate the charges, ask the judge to just dismiss the 498A case as it is a framed one.  To make your case stronger and to expect an earlier settlement file counter cases against her to give her a taste of her own venom.  Below is a list of counter cases. 32, 120B,  167 (investigation cannot be completed in 24 hours),  182 (offenses committed by letters), 191 (transfer on application of the accused),  197 (prosecution of judges and public servants),  199 (defamation),  200 (examination of complainant),  201 (Magistrate not competent), 204,  209 (triable exclusively by Court of Session), 211,  249 (absence of complainant),  250 (compensation for accusation), 306,  321 (withdrawl from prosecution),  323 (commit to Session Court), 355, 378, 379,  384 (summary dismissal of appeal),  392 (judge of Court of Appeal are equally divided),  406 (criminal breach of trust), 420,  467 (period of limitation), 471,  497 (adultery), 499,  500 (defamation),  504 (insult with intent to provoke a breach of peace),  506 (criminal intimidation), RCR  Damage recovery case u/s 9 of CPC (law of torts): If she breaks into your home, creates a scene, and goes to \" protection officer \" and lies that you abused her \"physically, emotionally or economically\", file a damage recovery case u/s 9 of CPC against her. Legally, you must issue notice on the same day or next day. The suit will continue for long time. It has no risk. Also u/s 9 of CPC (law of torts), claim damages for loss of consortium. Q. How do I make sure that my ex-wife does not file a false 498A again in the future?  A. She could possibly file a false 498a again in the future. The only recourse is to make her understand that you are not going to take it lightly and you are going to take appropriate actions if she does it again. If you break her first false 498a into multiple cases and file counter cases against her for defamation, forgery etc that may prevent her from refilling another 498a in future. Q. Does a man have to pay 1/3 of his salary as maintenance in case the wife claims maintenance?  A. No. Q. My wife filed a false case that I am impotent, do you suggest any judgements which can help me out from this false case? A. 1. AP High Court, Susarala Subramanya Shetty Vs S Padmavati, CMA 3155 of 2002. CORAM: Hon'ble J Chalameshwar & Gopala Krishna Tamada Alleging Impotency amounts to immense mental agony and cruelty  2. Rajasthan High Court, Nirmala Manohar Singh Vs Manohar Shivram Jagesha, First Appeal No 589 of 1985 CORAM: Hon'ble Mr. A V Savant Alleging Impotency amounts to immense mental agony and cruelty  3. Rajasthan High Court, Smt Shanti Devi Vs Raghav Prakash, CMA 19 of 1982 CORAM: Hon'ble Mr. Guman Lal Lodha Alleging Impotency amounts to immense mental agony and cruelty 4. Delhi High Court, Ashok Sharma Vs Santosh Sharma, FOA No 118 of 1982 Sorry, seems to have lost this judgment so can't give CORAM Alleging Impotency amounts to immense mental agony and cruelty 5. MP High Court, Smt Chandan Agarwal Vs Mukesh Kr. Agarwal FOA 39 of 1995 Hon'ble N P Singh Alleging Impotency and lodging 498a and defaming family for dowry amounts to immense mental agony and cruelty Q. What is the maximum maintenance amount for a resident Indian?  A. Maximum is around Rs.3000 per month. Exceptions are very rare. Q. What is the maximum maintenance amount for a non-resident Indian (NRI)?  A. Maximum is about Rs.10000 per month. Exceptions are very rare. Q. Can I appeal the order of maintenance?  A. Yes. You can appeal (get it set-aside) within 3 months of the order. Q. Can I bring some facts to the judge and get my maintenance reduced?  A. Yes.  1) If the wife is working, then the amount can be quite less. 2) If the wife owns a property, the amount can further be reduced (Section 25(1) of HMA).  3) Your other liabilities: house rent, medical bills for the amount spent on the treatment of your parents, liabilities towards sister(s), loan payments, provident fund, tax, etc.  4) Adultery or remarriage (Section 25(3) of HMA and Section 125(3) of CrPC) will lead to cancellation of maintenance.  5) Without any sufficient reason, the wife refuses to live with her husband (Section 125(4) of CrPC) . Use your wife's failure to comply with RCR. 6) Both are living seperately by mutual consent (Section 125(4) of CrPC). Q. Can my wife claim a share in my or in my parents' property?  A. No. Q. Can my wife claim Residence Rights in my or in my parents' property?  A. She can claim residence rights of a part of the last accommodation she lived in with you. Q. What is one-time alimony? A. Instead of giving regular maintenance, it may be possible to make a one time settlement in which the guy gives a lump sum amount to the wife. Often, the lawyers of both sides encourage the women to demand astronomical amounts as alimony. CAW (Crime Against Women) cells often coerce the man and his family as well. Sources tell, there are parties in this whole extortion who get their shares. One of our aims should be to bypass the crooks while negotiating these amounts. Q. My charge-sheet has not been submitted. What should I do? A. Normal time frame for submission of charge-sheet is 3 months. If it has taken longer,  1) Ask the Investigating Officer to issue a certificate that the 498a complaint is false.  2) Go for quash on FIR.  3) Use Right to Information (RTI). Q. First my wife filed 498a and then she filed Domestic Violence (DV) act. What should I do?  A. Appeal to high court for the stay of DV act. As long as 498a is ongoing, DV act application is not valid, and stay till the time high court petition is disposed off.  Q. My wife has already filed false 498a against me and my family, but now she wants to compromise and settle back with me again. What should I do?  A. It is not easy to trust someone who has resorted to use 498a in order to harass you and your family. You are the best judge of her and the situation after she comes back to live with you. If you want to give your wife a second chance, do so at your own peril. One of the biggest risks of letting her come back is that she will be able to file 304B and put you in jail. Most of 304B cases happen because of this reason. Q. I am an NRI. My wife filed false 498a/406 on me in India some time back. Now she says that she repents about all that happened and is ready to sign any agreements stating that she will not file such cases again, both in the US and in India. Can I take her back (to a foreign country) if I have such agreements?  A: Very important point to note that you cannot enter these kind of clauses that your wife going forward cannot file complaints against you under Domestic Violence in USA or in India.  Even Child Custody & Support is the controversial matter which your wife can always challenge in the court anywhere in the world even if you have already entered a clause in either Pre-Nuptial or Post-Nuptial agreements.  Only things which can work pretty much in these Pre-Nuptial & Post-Nuptial agreements are mutually agreed division of property, cash and other assets like car etc in the event of separation or divorce.  If you enter the clauses related to domestic violence or assault as such in to pre/post natal agreements, and something happen like that no court will agree on this and you will be charged for a Domestic Violence if your wife complaints to police and you will be jailed immediately for up to a year in USA (no idea on other countries). Once these charges will be proved wrong later on then you can sue your wife for your losses occurred during this period. But if your wife is not working then you can't do much to re-cover your losses.  Q. I have got an ex parte decree. What should I do?  A. Send by registered post a copy of the decree to her last known place of residence with an acknowledgment due. Publish the decree in a newspaper which has a edition in her city. Your job is over. Carry on with life. You can remarry one month after this publication. Q. Are the counseling centers at police stations sincere?  A. Generally No. They and police have a nexus. The counseling centers are normally run by NGOs. If the guy is a techie or an NRI, then the police ensure that 498a gets filed. If he and his wife somehow avert it, then they are directed to the counseling centre. These centers stage manage towards a 498a. Unofficial sources say half of the bribes police gets go to the NGOs via back channel. Q. Should I compromise for false 498a? Should I go for out of court settlement by paying money?  A. First of all, do not do compromise by paying money, if you have to compromise, do it without paying any single paisa. If you pay money, you are indirectly either accepting the blackmailing or agreeing the guilt. In the society, you are encouraging unscrupulous women to do more blackmailing. Moreover, when you will remarry after the divorce, your second wife will know that you are prone to blackmail. You will again be vulnerable to a second blackmail.  Despite of all this, if you decide to pay and compromise then DO NOT PAY all the money till high court or above courts have given the final order of compounding the IPC 498a and all offence including the divorce decree. You should get this in writing (in the same agreement) by her and her family members (get it notarized). Also get them to file court statement under IPC-156 that they will not challenge this order in higher courts and that they will take back all the cases filed against you and all your relatives in all the courts.  Q. Can the IPC-498a be compounded by lower courts (if wife gives the statement that she does not want to pursue the case?  A. No. Please remember that IPC 498a can be compounded only by High Courts (498a is compoundable in Andhra Pradesh) or the Supreme Court. Lower courts do not have this authority. Q. My passport has been impounded. How can I get it back?  A. Use section 451 and 457 of IPC to get them back. Q. I am not allowed to leave the jurisdiction of the court. What should I do?  A. Use section 437 of IPC to get the condition relaxed.  Your lawyer should file IPC 205 petition to allow you to travel. Q. What is the role of lawyers in 498a cases?  A. Lawyers generally encourage women to file 498a. Lawyers from both sides join hands and guide the case in such a manner that the case gets prolonged and the guy agrees for a hefty settlement. Lawyers get some 20% of the big settlement amount. Q. I feel my lawyer is squeezing me out. Could you suggest me how much should a lawyer charge for Anticipatory bail and regular bail? Could someone tell what would be the minimum and the uppermost limit for Bail Charges?  A. There is no approved schedule of rates. Rates vary on a case-by-case, person-to-person basis. However, you must tell the lawyer clearly about your budget. Lawyer fee and bail amount depends on the factors mentioned below.  a) Where the Bail application is being filed. Ex. Session/high Court. b) How senior and what is the reputation of the Lawyer. c) How many accused are involved? d) How difficult is the case? The charges vary from Rs 2,000/ to 50,000/ Q. What is the stand of judiciary on 498a misuse?  A. Judiciary knows very well about 498a misuse. Supreme Court called it legal terrorism. But all are a kind of helpless due to pressures from feminist groups. There is a bill on Rajya Sabha for amendment to 498a. Justice Malimath, former chief justice of Karnataka and Kerala high courts headed a committee which gave its report on comprehensive amendments on Criminal Laws. This committee recommended that 498a be made bailable and compoundable. Feminist groups and their contacts inside Amnesty International cried foul and threatened for agitation on this issue. Q. How long does a 498a case run? A. It generally runs for 4 to 5 years. Q. What is the conviction rate in 498a?  A. It is only 2% or even less. Q. Does 498a help the real dowry harassment victims?  A. Generally no. It helps sometimes when the girl is dead. The police often send the women back to her husband giving him and his family a warning. Q. How can I contribute to the fight against 498a?  A. You can write blogs and sign a Public Interest Lititigation (PIL) on the internet Q. What is the relation between 498a and feminism?  A. Indian feminism gets almost 100% inspired from western feminism. In the background, feminism and left-wing thinking is interconnected. Indian Feminists demand that 498a be kept as non-bailable and non-compoundable even though many women and old people spend time in jail, as they get falsely accused. They say, women must be protected from dowry deaths, no matter whether men are protected from misuse of 498a or not. This means, they do not care about men, his parents, sisters, brothers, and other relatives. Q. What is the difference between quashing, withdrawing and compromising 498A case against you?  A. Following are the terms used by lawyers and judges and police.  Setting aside- When a party gets aggrieved by any order of a lower court, a revision petition is filed to set aside that order. Quashing- When a party is aggrieved by a judgment, an appeal is filed to quash the judgment. Expunction -When a party is aggrieved by certain observations/findings and not necessarily the order/judgment, then the higher court is petitioned to expunge the portions objected. Withdrawing-When a complainant no more wants to pursue a case, s/he prays the trial court for withdrawal of the case. If the court is satisfied, then it orders as \"dismissed as withdrawn\". Since 498a is a cognizable criminal case, she cannot withdraw without your consent.  Compromise-Settle the matter outside the court and inform it to close the case. Reconciliation -Forgive and forget. The difference is that in compromise there may be terms and conditions of settlement but in reconciliation no there are no terms and conditions. Q. What is the difference between a petition getting dismissed and disposed?  A. Dismissed: Means the relief asked by you is Rejected. Disposed: The court gives some direction either to you or respondents to do or not to do something. Your main relief may or may not be granted. But some direction is given through these orders.  Q. Can a woman ask for interim maintenance during 498A case?  A. A wife can ask Interim Maintanence or Alimony at any time after she parted you. There is no time bar to specify that she should ask with in so and so days. If she prefers, she can ask at any time and even years will not bar her.   ________________________________________________________________________ Glossary AB: Anticipatory Bail CAW cell: Cell for Crime Against Women CI: Circle Inspector CPC.: Civil Procedure Code CrPC: Criminal Procedure Code CS: Charge-sheet DIL: Daughter-in-law FIL: Father-in-law  HMA: Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 HSA: Hindu Succession Act Hubby: Husband IO: Investigating Officer MIL: Mother-in-law NCW: National Commission for Women RCR: Restitution of Conjugal Rights (Section 9 of HMA)  RTI: Right to Information SIL: Sister-in-law  Cognizable: a police officer may, in accordance with the First Schedule or under and other law for the time being in force, arrest without warrant."

If she does not agree for mutual consent divorce, you can file a petition for divorce on grounds of cruelty, which is the valid ground for divorce under section 13 of Hindu Marriage Act where you would have to produce documentary evidence to show so that she is inflicting cruelty upon you and your family in order to get a decree of divorce from court. Also, your wife's putting condition on you to live separately and to leave your parents is a valid ground for divorce as it constitutes grave cruelty upon the spouse and the same has been categorically held by the Supreme Court of India."

Once it is filed it is defense for you if she files any other case against you.  wife tries to separate her husband from his parents amounts to cruelty, then husband is entitled for divorce. The Following Supreme court judgments will help you. Forcing Husband To Get Separated From His Parents, Amounts To \u2019Cruelty\u2019: SC The Supreme Court of India in Narendra vs. K.Meena has held that persistent effort of the wife to constrain her husband to be separated from the family constitutes an act of \u2018cruelty\u2019 to grant divorce. Hindu son can divorce wife if she tries to separate him from aged parents A Hindu son can divorce his wife for the cruelty of trying to pry him away from his \u201cpious obligation\u201d to live with his aged parents and provide shelter to them, the Supreme Court has held. A woman becomes a part of the husband\u2019s family and cannot seek to separate him from his parents for the sole reason that she wants to entirely enjoy his income, a Bench of Justices Anil R. Dave and L. Nageshwara Rao observed in a judgment. Insisting her husband to live separately from his parents is a western thought alien to our culture and ethos, Justice Dave, who wrote the judgment, said. \u201cIt is not a common practice or desirable culture for a Hindu son in India to get separated from his parents on getting married at the instance of the wife, especially when the son is the only earning member in the family. A son, brought up and given education by his parents, has a moral and legal obligation to take care and maintain the parents, when they become old and when they have either no income or have a meagre income,\u201d Justice Dave wrote. In India, generally people do not subscribe to the western thought, where, upon getting married or attaining majority, the son gets separated from the family, the court said. In normal circumstances, a wife is expected to be with the family of the husband after the marriage.  \u201cShe becomes integral to and forms part of the family of the husband and normally without any justifiable strong reason, she would never insist that her husband should get separated from the family and live only with her,\u201d Justice Dave observed. The court was confirming the divorce of a Karnataka-based couple in a recent judgment. Married in 1992, the lower court granted the husband divorce after he alleged cruelty on his wife\u2019s part. He quoted instances of her constant suspicions about him having illegal affairs with a maid. It was later found that no such maid as described by the wife ever worked in the couple\u2019s home In another instance, the apex court found that the wife had attempted to commit suicide but was rescued in the nick of time. She wanted to separate the man from his parents who were dependent on his income. However, the High Court had set aside the decree of divorce, saying the wife had a \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d to see her husband\u2019s income used for her and not his family members. Shuddering at the thought of the legal tangles in which the \u201cpoor husband\u201d would have found himself caught in had she succeeded in committing suicide, the Supreme Court concluded: \u201cThe mere idea with regard to facing legal consequences would put a husband under tremendous stress.\u201d"

Kamla Devi V. Mool Raj# If there is a positive finding that husband has failed to maintain wife, therefore the order of maintenance is passed. The Revisional court cannot upset and interfere with the finding of lower court. Munesh Kumari V. sheo Raj Singh# The questions related to child is illegitimate, is applicant a wife, being pre-eminently questions of fact cannot be reopened and revisional court cannot substitute its own views. Now if the finding of the trial court is that applicant is a legally wedded wife and high court disturbs the finding that applicant is not a legally wedded wife and disturbs the finding this cannot be permitted as the finding would become negative and such findings would have have a long lasting impact on the society with evil consequences.However if the finding of the high court is negetive than only higher courts have power to interfere with the order. Santosh(smt) V. Naresh Pal   MP HC | Maintenance order under S. 125 CrPC cancelled as wife was living separately without any justified reason   Madhya Pradesh High Court: S.K. Awasthi, J. contemplated a revision application under Section 19(4) of Family Courts Act, 1984 read with Sections 397 and 401 CrPC. In the instant application, the applicant was directed to pay Rs 3000 per month as maintenance under Section 125 CrPC. Facts leading to the filing of this revision application were that respondent-wife moved an application under Section 125 CrPC against the applicant for grant of a maintenance amount, she alleged that after some time of the marriage, the applicant persistently made a demand of dowry from the respondent; and he used to harass her. Since then, she was residing in the house of her mother. She does not had any source of income thus, she found it difficult to maintain herself, whereas the applicant had 10 bighas of agricultural land and he was also engaged in the business of selling cattle, thereby earning Rs 1,00,000 per annum. Therefore, a prayer was made by the respondent/wife for grant of maintenance of Rs 10,000 per month before the Family Court. The said application was partly allowed vide the impugned order and the Family Court had directed the applicant to pay Rs 3,000 per month towards the maintenance of the respondent. Feeling aggrieved by the fixation of a maintenance amount, the applicant had preferred this revision application. The applicant-husband contended that the marriage was solemnized in 2015 as per Muslim Rituals and Customs. It was further submitted that the respondent had earlier registered a case under Section 498-A of Penal Code, 1860 under Section 3 read with Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, but the matter was amicably settled between them but subsequently, the respondent again deserted him. The counsel for the applicant, M.K. Sharma, submitted that the respondent was not entitled to receive any maintenance as she had deserted the applicant without any reason. It was highlighted that the respondent did not want to live in a joint family and if the applicant arranged for a separate residence she was willing to return. Court on such contention by the applicant observed that, the Family Court had committed an error of law in allowing the application for grant of maintenance, as the case was not in favor of the respondent. The Court stated that, the respondent had accepted in her statement that earlier she lodged FIR against the applicant and his parents for the commission of the said offence. However, later on, she compromised the matter and returned back to her matrimonial house. Thereafter, she again left her matrimonial house, in her cross-examination in which she categorically stated that she was ready to live with the applicant if the applicant makes arrangement for their separate residence. The actions of the respondents were found contradictory. Hence the revision was allowed and the order was cancelled.[Aarif v. Shajida, 2019 SCC OnLine MP 1379, decided on [deleted]]"

It is not mandatory to visit CAW cell as that is only a mediation cell and no one can be forced to mediate with someone.  02. Since your marriage was solmenised in April 2019 itself so I would suggest you to file a case of voidable marriage under section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act seeking nullification of the marriage on the ground on forced consent. The good thing about this petition is that if you win this case you will get the status of single rather than getting the status of divorcee if you contest for divorce.  03. But before going for the case under section 12 file a criminal complaint in against your wife and in-laws under section 406, 415, 420, 504, 506 of the IPC stating that you have been duped on the pretext of this marriage and now are being threatened with dire consequences if you do not bow down to their illegal claims.  Send this complaint to the concern Police Station by the way of post. Keep the tracking report of the post with yourself. After a week send similar complaint to the DCP of your concern area by the way of post and keep the tracking report of that as well with yourself.  Then file your application under section 200 and 202 of CrPC before the court to get your criminal case registered in against your wife and in-laws.  Once you have reached to the court by the way of this route then approach the court under section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act for the nullification of your marriage. From hereon, stop entertaining your wife and in-laws through any medium either by way of phone, sms, social message etc. If they try calling or contacting you or family do not entertain them at all. In fact tell this to your distant relative also and warn them that if they get in touch with your wife or in-laws they may end up in court as she may use that conversation to implicate them in criminal cases. Install a CCTv camera at the gate of your house if possible even inside your home also so that if they try to enter in your house forcibly then that can be well recorded and be presented before the court.  Collect every evidence which is there with you for both the cases (criminal as well as nullification) and meet an advocate of your choice and detail him everything about your case. He will assist you further.  Prepare a date sheet detailing everything about this marriage right from the first talk till now. Prepare that in an excel sheet with three columns -  Date - Incident happened on that date - proof to back that incident which is being claimed on that date For e.g. DD.MM.YYYY - We met for the first time for the talk over matrimonial alliance at my home - I have bills of the food products purchased for this meeting."

Hindu Marriage Act is applicable in cases where both husband and wife are Hindus, or where they have converted into any of these religions. Where either of the husband or wife or both are not Hindus, the marriage is registered under The Special Marriage Act, 1954. 1.\tReligious Marriage Ceremony 2.\tCivil Marriage Ceremony Section 5 of The Hindu Marriage Act specifies that conditions must be met for a marriage to be able to take place. If a ceremony takes place, but the conditions are not met, the marriage is either void by default, or voidable. Section 7 of the Hindu Marriage Act recognises that there may be different, but equally valid ceremonies and customs of marriage. As such, Hindu marriage may be solemnized in accordance with the customary rites and ceremonies of either the bride or the groom. These rites and ceremonies include the Saptapadi and Kreva. A marriage cannot be registered unless the following conditions are fulfilled: 1.\ta ceremony of marriage has been performed; and 2.\tthe parties have been living together as husband and wife. 3.\tAdditionally, the parties must have been residing within the district of the Marriage Officer for a period of not less than thirty days immediately preceding the date on which the application is made to him for registration. So in your case you have to produce genuine documents/certificates like birth Certificate and residential certificates, a simple affidavit and a few photographs. It generally takes 2-3 hours to solemnize the marriage. A certificate is provided by the Arya Samaj Mandir. On this certificate, the married couple can also register his marriage in marriage registration office/court later."

                "response-text": "This is adverse possession as claimed against the title of owner without his permission but it can be taken as defence you cannot file a declaration suit on it. Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act confers power on the court to grant declaratory reliefs. Section 34 provides that any person entitled to any legal character, or to any right as to any property, may Institute a suit against any person denying, or interested to deny, his title to such character or right, and the court may in its discretion make therein a declaration that he is so entitled. There is no law which provides that when a person possesses a property adverse to the interest of the real owner, he becomes the owner of the property. On the other hand, when it is said that the person in adverse possession has perfected title, it only means that since the person who had the right to possession has allowed his right to be extinguished, the person who is in adverse possession will be entitled to hold the property as its absolute owner. As such, a suit for declaration of title by adverse possession can only be treated as a suit for declaration of a legal character. The question is as to whether a declaration of such a legal character can be sought. Article 65 of the schedule to the Limitation Act deals with the period of limitation for suits for possession of immovable property or any interest therein based on title. As per the said Article, the period of limitation prescribed for suits of the said nature is twelve years from the date when the possession of the defendant becomes adverse to the plaintiff. In other words, if the possession of the defendant does not become adverse to the plaintiff, there is no period of limitation for a suit for possession based on title. Article 65 does not confer any right on the defendant over the property. On the other hand, the said Article provides for a defence to persons in possession of immovable property of others. Section 27 of the Limitation Act provides that at the determination of the period prescribed to any person for instituting a suit for possession of any property, his right to such property shall be extinguished. Section 27 would operate only when a plea of adverse possession is established by the defendant in an action for possession based on title. In other words, the extinguishment of the right of the real owner is dependent on the establishment of adverse possession by the person in possession and the question of establishment of adverse possession arises only when a suit is filed for possession based on title. It is therefore, evident that the plea of adverse possession is only a shield and not a sword at all. If that be so, I have no hesitation to hold that a suit for declaration of title over a property by adverse possession and limitation is not maintainable. I draw support to this view from the decision of the Apex Court in Gurudwara Sahib v. Gram Panchayat Village Sirthala (supra). Paragraph 7 of the said judgment reads thus:  \"In the Second Appeal, the relief of ownership by adverse  possession is again denied holding that such a suit is not  maintainable. There cannot be any quarrel to this extent the  judgments of the courts below are correct and without any  blemish. Even if the plaintiff is found to be in adverse possession,  it cannot seek a declaration to the effect that such adverse  possession has matured into ownership. Only if proceedings filed  against the appellant and appellant is arrayed as defendant that it  can use this adverse possession as a shield/defence.\""

In such cases the transferor is debarred from agitating his title to the property against the purchaser."

                "response-text": "From examining all the facts of your query I want to say that-These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. At times, despite our best efforts, life takes a turn for the worst. We may have wanted different things from life, but life\u2019s got its own plan as well. A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that\u2019s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. Marriages are hard. Divorces\u2026even harder. Nobody enters a marriage thinking about a divorce in the end. If some are unable to cope with the harsh realities of marriage, the only viable option in front of them is to approach the Court and seek legal separation by way of mutual consent divorce. You know that Stamp paper is a sheet of paper with a printed revenue stamp of a fixed value like Rs. 10, Rs.20, Rs. 2000 etc. This is a source of revenue for the government/authority. In most of the States/Countries, valuable documents are only valid if done on a prescribed value of stamp paper. These values are provided by the govt. of the respective states from where the paper is purchased. These values may vary from state to state. In case of Thiruvengada Pillai & Ors vs Navneethammal & Anr, (2008) Supreme Court held that the Indian Stamp Act, 1889 is silent about the expiry date of stamp paper. The Proviso of the time interval of six months defined in Sec-54 is only for the purpose of entreat reimbursement of the value of the unused stamp paper, not for the use of stamp paper. Sec-54 does not entail the person to use the stamp paper within 6 months. Therefore, there is no cure for a stamp paper bought more than 6 months before the suggested date of implementation, being used for a document. However, there is no time limit for the effectiveness of stamps. Please understand that she might use it in future to adversely affect you. Amount of 50,000 or half of your salary is very high figure. Supreme Court in case of Dr. Kulbhushan Kumar vs. Raj Kumari and Anr. (1970) it was held that 25% of the husband\u2019s net salary would be just and proper to be awarded as maintenance to the respondent-wife. The amount of permanent alimony awarded to the wife must be befitting the status of the parties and the capacity of the spouse to pay maintenance. Maintenance is always dependant on the factual situation of the case and the court would be justified in moulding the claim for maintenance passed on various factors. While dealing with such cases in Supreme Court I have observed that the views of Courts are also divided when it comes to the validity and enforceability of prenups. In some judgments like in Sunita Devendra Deshprabhu v. Sita Devendra Deshprabu courts have taken into consideration prenups for the division of assets. But in some judgments like Tekait Mon Mohini Jemadai v. Basanta and Kumar Singh and Krishna Aiyar v. Balammal, they have considered prenups as non-executable and invalid.But in all the cases there was one thing common, courts have considered the prenups as an important factor in ascertaining the intentions of the parties and on the understanding on the basis of which the marriage has been solemnized. In all the courts, Prenups have played an important role in divisions of assets irrespective of the fact that there is no specific law pertaining to their enforceability and validity. Discussion with complete facts is required in such cases. You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification. I hope you and your family are safe and healthy.

Same sex, homo sexuality did not come under 497.  6) Family might not be impleaded in the case as family had no role to play. However, younger brother will have to defend himself in courts.

Divorce allows a person to break free from an onerous marital relationship. As per the law as it stands our legal system does not allow divorce to be granted on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage or irreconcilable differences. To get a divorce one has to prove wrongdoing on the part of other spouse, and impeccable conduct of one\u2019s own in order to win. Divorce is granted only on proof of fault or guilty conduct of one party and innocence of the other. The most common ground for divorce is cruelty. Another common ground is adultery (sexual intercourse outside wedlock) one instance of lapse of virtue can lead to divorce. Adultery is a ground for divorce under Section 13(1)(i) of Hindu Marriage Act, the spouse who engages in extra-marital intercourse is guilty of adultery. In case of adultery direct proof is difficult to get and one has to rely for proof thereof on circumstantial evidence and the same may be sufficiently proved from which adultery maybe inferred. The burden of proving adultery in a matrimonial case is on the person who makes the allegation. The standard of proof in \"proceedings under the Act being initially of a civil nature is by preponderance of, probabilities and not by proving it beyond reasonable doubt. General evidence of the ill-repute of the husband or of the lewd company that he keeps, or even that he knows the addresses of prostitutes and was seen with doubtful women, would neither prove nor probabilise adultery. Adulter , as a general rule, is proved by presumptive proof based on: (i) circumstantial evidence,  (ii) evidence 0 non-access and the birth of children,  (iii) Contracting venereal disease,  (iv) evidence of visit to houses of ill-repute,  (v) admissions made In previous proceedings,  (vi) confessions and admissions of the parties Mere suspicion is not sufficient.

These requirements are as follows \u2013  The exemption is available to individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) To claim the exemption, the sale proceeds should be used in the following manner \u2013  To buy a new residential property one year before the date of sale of the asset To buy a residential property within 2 years from the date of sale of the asset To construct a residential property within 3 years from the date of sale of the asset   If you invest a part of the sale proceeds in the property, the full exemption would not be allowed.

I would advise you to file a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act with the appropriate forum. In it, you can allege negligence and/or deficiency in service against the concerned hospital and medical practioners. To prove a case of medical negligence, you will first need to establish that the hospital/medical practitioner owed a duty of care to your wife and the said duty of care was breached. This seems to be true in your case in that the hospital did not wait even for 12 hours when the norm is 24 hours. But note that I am taking you on your word here. I am going to refrain from commenting on the chances of success of such a claim without a fuller grasp of facts. You can claim two types of damages: general and special. These two broad categories contain a number of sub categories including medical expenses incurred, future medical expenses, loss of income, loss of future earnings in case of disability, loss of consortium in certain cases, etc. First things first, you should quantify your claim with the help of an advocate and send them a legal notice. If they fail to meet your demands, you can file a complaint in the appropriate forum. Do note that you don\u2019t need an advocate to represent you in the consumer forum but I\u2019d would personally advise you to hire one seeing as medical negligence matters tend to be rather involved.

RAMAMOHANA RAO  AND  THE HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE S.S.SUNDAR  ========================================================== 31.Hence this Court is of the firm view that the respondent bank cannot exercise right of lien to secure any other liabilities of the mortgagor by retaining the documents of the mortgagor or guarantor, which are deposited with an intention to secure a particular loan transaction. Lien is primarily considered as a right to retain security. It is doubtful, whether in exercise of such right to retain the title deeds the mortgagee can bring the property for sale for recovery of some debt which is due from the mortgagor, in connection with a different transaction, which is not covered by the mortgage 37.In view of the findings as arrived at by this Court, the writ petition filed by the petitioner stands allowed and the respondent bank is directed to return the documents in respect of the properties belonging to the petitioner which were given as security by way of deposit of title deeds."

The agreement mentions \u201cA offered to sell the property to B for a valuable sale consideration of Rs 20 lakhs. Possession of the property will be handed over to B at the registration of the sale deed\u201d. So far B has paid Rs 17 lakhs to A.      The sale deed has not been registered.      Now A wants to sell the flat to C (I am the prospective purchaser C). B has no objection to C purchasing the flat from A. The consideration amount is nearly Rs 20 lakhs less than the value as per Sub Registrar office. The stamp duty will be paid as applicable to the property value as per Sub Registrar Office.      An advocate drafted a tripartite agreement defining A as vendor and B as agreement holder. The tripartite agreement will be signed by vendor A, agreement holder B and the purchaser C. An absolute sale deed has been drafted with A as vendor and C as purchaser and to be signed by B as Consenting Witness. A token sum has been agreed upon to be paid at the time of signing the tripartite agreement. The remaining amount is to be paid on registration of property. Advocate said that since B is not the owner of the property, all payments i.e., token payment as well as final payment; have to be in favour of A.      B wants that the final payment be split into two: 17 lakhs in favour of B and the remaining amount in favour of A. B wants that he is to be mentioned in absolute sale deed as Confirming Party but not as Consenting Witness.         PLEASE CLARIFY THE FOLLOWING:      Is it correct to make part payment to B by C, because the property is registered in the name of A.?      What is the difference between Confirming Party and Consenting Witness?      Is there any likelihood of C facing questions from Tax authorities \u2013 on why is the consideration amount for sale less than the property value by about Rs 20 lakhs.",

The prevailing withholding tax is deducted at source, and is 1% of the consideration payable to the seller. It is the responsibility of the buyer to deduct the tax from payment to seller and deposit the same in the government treasury. Where the transaction is less than Rs 50,00,000 /-, the liability to deduct tax at source will not be applicable.

IF you need to take a DNA test you have to file petition for that before the court.DNA test in a matter relating to paternity of a child should not be directed by the court as a matter of course or in a routine manner, whenever such a request is made. The court has to consider diverse aspects including presumption under Section 112 of the Evidence Act; pros and cons of such order and the test of \u201ceminent need\u201d whether it is not possible for the court to reach the truth without use of such test. DNA testing is the most legitimate and scientifically perfect means, which the husband could use, to establish his assertion of infidelity. This should simultaneously be taken as the most authentic, rightful and correct means also with the wife, for her to rebut the assertions made by the husband, and to establish that she had not been unfaithful, adulterous or disloyal. If the wife is right, she shall be proved to be so. Section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act also creates a legal presumption that the birth of a child during marriage would be a \u201cconclusive proof of legitimacy.\u201d Supreme Court judgment is meant to protect the honour of the child and its mother. In a matter where paternity of a child is in issue before the court, the use of DNA is an extremely delicate and sensitive aspect. The presumption of legitimacy is a presumption of law. When a child is born out of wedlock, there is a presumption in favour of his legitimacy and the presumption largely depends on the presumed fact that the parties to a marriage have necessary access to each other when a divorce petition is filed. The courts have always adopted a judicious approach after weighing the material on record by posing a question whether there exists sufficient material on record to dispel the presumption as to legitimacy at the behest of the person challenging the legitimacy warranting such direction or not and thereafter arrived at the positive finding as to the conducting and non conducting of the DNA tests on case to case basis. Courts do not order DNA tests just because you think you are not the father of the child.  That is for two reasons: (a)Woman's chastity should not be put to test just because the husband doubts her; and  (b) Child should not be bastardized unless there are strong irrefutable grounds. Husbands will not be allowed by Courts to go on a fishing expedition seeking the Courts to be involved to satisfy their doubts. So in your case , you have to establish the need for DNA test and convince the ingredients of Section 13(1)(i) of the Hindu Marriage Act."

But even that is not enough to escape from the conclusiveness of Section 112 of the Act, e.g, if a husband and wife were living together during the time of conception but the DNA test revealed that the child was not born to the husband, the conclusiveness in law would remain unrebuttable.\u201d"

No woman can be blamed for an adulterous relation relationship and no child can be called as illegitimate unless there is conclusive evidence in support of such conclusions. The case of Sunil Eknath Trambake v Leelavati Sunil Trambake clarified that in the matter of proving the paternity of a child, a DNA test can be ordered only in exceptional and deserving cases if it is in the interest of the child. The charge of adultery is serious as it casts aspersions on the character of the spouse affecting his/her reputation in the society besides raising question marks in terms of the parentage of the child delivered by the wife, therefore not only the charges of adultery should be specific but also should be established in all probabilities. The proceedings for adultery, under the Hindu Marriage Act, are in the nature of quasi-criminal, as such, higher standard of proof than mere preponderance of probabilities is required as was held in Partap v Veena. So you have to establish your case. How and to who the adulterous relationship done."

        "query-text": "My sister(36 yrs old) passed away on the 22nd of May, 2015. The cause of her death was due to utter negligence of her husband. She was totally bedridden for the past 7 days and was left unattended at home. My father had been repeatedly telling her husband to take her to the nearest hospital as he could feel that her condition was worsening. Her phone was out-of-order and the only way to reach her was on her husband's mobile. Most of the time he would not return our calls or hang-up abruptly. When we sensed that he's not taking any action my parents decided to travel to her place from Kolkata. But before they could reach she passed away. Only after my father literally cried and begged him he decided to take her to the clinic. When she was taken to the hospital the doctor declared as \"brought dead\". He said that sodium-potassium level was very low in her body. She was staying with her husband and her 6yr daughter only. Ever since she gave birth to a girl child she was mentally tortured by her husband and mother-in-law. All major responsibilities of the child were being take-up by my sister. My sister was a university topper(M.A. in English) and worked as a teacher for D.P.S. Rourkela. She was one of the best teachers in town. Somehow her popularity did not go down well with her in laws. She was a very strong woman but coyuldn't leave her husband beacuse she understood the importance of both mother and fatehr in a child's life. She's was married to him for 7 yrs only.      During her sickness he used to go outside and have his meals without feeding his wife/daughter( as told by my niece).       Now coming to the child, she's been staying with my parents in Kolkata since May 2015. She knows very well of her father's negligence and she was the only witness of her mother's ailment. He father has authorised my parents to be her guardian as she's studying now in D.P.S. Kolkata.      She's very close to our family. Her grandparents from the paternal side do not even inquire about her well-being. Her father sends 3000/- per month for her school fees which is not even the total fees we pay per month. Every year the school demands 11000/- at the beginning of he session which is being paid by my father who's a retired SAIL officer.      My husband and I are software engineers and currently live in U.S.A. We want legal custody of the child and file a case against him. We had lodged a complaint when the incident happened. But he started threatening us that he would take back my niece. My father had to withdraw the complaint as we did not want the child to be in such unsafe hands at any cost. Even the post mortem report doesn't have the reason for death. My father has been fighting for the Forensic report since them but we still do not have information on that. WE STILL DO NOT KNOW THE ACTUAL CAUSE OF HER DEATH.         Please advise.",

Question 1 - Is it now legally required by myself to file IA & become a necessary party in HC to protect my property which was sold by my brother without my consent to developer or since developer is already made as necessary party in my suit, is it enough to continue my partition suit ?      2.\tMy father made registered deed in 1980\u2019s among 5 sons & 2 daughters & given lion share to sons & limited share to daughters & preserved 10 acres as parents share till their life time & also mentioned in the deed of two things       (a)\tSuch parents\u2019 share of 10 acres should go to 5 sons equally after their life time.    However, after my father\u2019s death, 10 acres mutated into my mother name but before my mother death & when she was in bed written condition 10 acres illegally through GPA & in the name of gift deed got transferred into the name of one of my brothers son & as such other brothers has filed case for the same & case is pending    (b)\tFurther also stated that no more properties were left for partition in the joint family.       However, there were certain properties left & after my father\u2019s death such properties were shared by only 5 sons through creating unregistered deed but as per unregistered deed also not mutated properties among 5 sons & as such there were certain disputes among 5 sons & case is also pending.       As stated in 1st question, already I have filed case for my 1/8th share in respect of those properties which were not covered under a registered deed of 1972 & which were shared by 5 sons without daughters consent through unregistered deed.          Question 2 \u2013 as per latest SC judgment &as a coparcener can I challenge such clause of giving share to only 5 sons in such 10 acres parents share instead of sharing among all 8 members (1/8) since neither they not acted as per the deed or not taken any possession of the properties & as such, can I file impleading application to on-going case among 5 sons to share among all 8 members of the family.      Question 3    As per 1st question, partition suit filed by me is only with respect to properties not covered under registered deed & as such not brought 10 acres of parents share in my partition suit which relates to registered deed of 1980\u2019s. So, now is it correct to file impleading application in ongoing cases filed by my brothers for their share in 10 acres of parents share or shall I file IA in my partition suit case to bring even that parents shares o f 10 acres for 1/8th share among all members family.",

The partition suit of the property must only be filed in the court having jurisdiction over the partition property. The law of limitation governs the partition of property. According to the Limitation Act, the limitation period to file a partition suit is 12 years (Article 65 of the Limitation Act). The period of such 12 years begins when there is a notification of the adverse claim to the plaintiff or the co-owners in the public domain.The deed is executed on a stamp paper and registered with the sub-registrar\u2019s office. Once the partition deed gets registered, it becomes legal and binding. Partition by way of partition deed is quite simpler as the same takes place through negotiations between the families and avoids the long-standing decisions of the court.A partition suit is instituted when the above-mentioned options fail as the claimants have different points of view and don\u2019t settle at a common resolution. Ultimately, the claimants are left to file a partition suit in the court having its jurisdiction.  There is no fixed time as to when and how a partition suit will be concluded. The period needed in deciding a partition suit differs from case to case. Hence, in total, a minimum period of three years is equipped. Although, as already mentioned, there can be an extension of time with regards to the complexity of the matter.The court fee differs from state to state. It is not consistent and equivalent in all the places. The amount of the court fee depends upon the value of the suit property. No, a coparcener cannot sell the property during the pendency of the suit. Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 provides transfer of property of a pending suit wherein it is stated that in case of any suit or proceedings is continuing and any right to immovable property is directly and specifically in question, such property cannot be transferred or otherwise dealt with by any party to the suit or proceeding.

I requested the owner to have it corrected however they are not able to trace the party they had purchased the flat from and hence can't execute a rectification deed. The owner is saying that he has checked from the registrar office and they are stating that you can mention about these errors in the new sale deed that you execute that there are typographical errors on the index page and area name and floor should be read as so and so instead of what is wrongly mentioned. Need urgent suggestion please on whether should I go ahead with the registry with such an arrangement as I don't want to face any challenges in future whenever I plan to further sell the flat.

Petitioner  Through: Mr. M. Dutta, Advocate  versus  UNION OF INDIA ..... Respondent  Through: Mr. Ruchir Mishra, Advocate  CORAM:  HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE VIPIN SANGHI  JUDGMENT VIPIN SANGHI, J. 1. The present writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India has been preferred by Ms. Teesta Chattoraj, a minor through her mother and natural guardian Smt. Rajeshwari Chattoraj. The petitioner seeks issuance of a writ of certiorari quashing the letter dated 04.04.2011 (Ref. No.RPO/PG/133/11) issued by the respondent, i.e. the Regional Passport Officer (RPO), New Delhi, whereby the petitioners request for issuance of a passport has been declined. The petitioner also seeks a writ of mandamus directing the respondent RPO to issue a passport in favour of the petitioner on the basis of the information supplied by the petitioner in her passport application form. 2. The petitioner was born on 15.11.1995 at Kolkata. Her natural parents are Sh. Abhijit Ghosh and Smt. Rajeshwari Ghosh, who is now known as Rajehswari Chattoraj. When the petitioner was only about two years old, the natural parents of the petitioner obtained decree of divorce by mutual consent. So far as the petitioner is concerned, the terms agreed between her natural parents, inter alia, provided that the petitioner's mother will not claim and/or demand of maintenance and/or alimony for the minor child at present or in future from the petitioner's father. It was also agreed that the petitioner's mother would maintain the petitioner. The petitioner's father admitted that he has no right to see the child for all times to come and he will not interfere in any manner regarding rearing up the child by the Opposite party and her family members and that he shall have no right to claim and/or demand for custody of the said child from the Opposite party. 3. The petitioner's mother married Sh. Surojit Chattoraj at New Delhi on 04.03.1999. By registered deed of adoption deed dated 12.06.2006, the petitioner was given in adoption by her mother to her husband Sh. Surojit Chattoraj. The petitioner submits that religious ceremonies to mark the acceptance of the petitioner by her adopted father were also held, and were attended by members and friends of the family. 4. On 26.07.2010, the petitioner applied for a passport, through her mother, to the respondent authority. The petitioner was required to provide, inter alia, the registered adoption deed, which was also provided. After much waiting, the petitioner was informed by the impugned communication that her application could not be accepted, as it had been found on scrutiny that the petitioners biological father's name, as per her birth certificate, had not been mentioned in the passport application form, and the adoption deed was not in accordance with the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (\"HAMA\"). 5. The gist of the communication dated 04.04.2011 issued by the RPO reads as follows: \"On scrutiny of file, it is seen that biological father's name as per birth certificate has not mentioned in the passport application form. The adoption Deed as per Adoption Act is also not valid. As per rules of Ministry of External Affairs Circular No.VI/401/01/05/2008 dated 05.10.2009 serial No.4(2) \"In the event of remarriage after divorce, the name of step- father/step mother cannot be written in the passport of children from the previous marriage. The relationship of the child to his biological parents subsists, even after divorce by parents. It is also not possible to leave the column of father or mother blank in the passport in such cases. Therefore, such applicants must write the names of their biological parents in the application form. However, if the stepfather or stepmother is appointed by a Court as legal guardian, the name of such step-parent can be written as legal guardian\". In view of the instruction, you are advised to furnish a fresh Form-1 with name of biological father or a Court Order appointing you as a Legal Guardian. This may be treated as Final Reminder, your compliance may reach this office within 15 days, failing which you have nothing to say and your complaint may be treated as closed\". (emphasis supplied). 6. Consequently, the petitioner has preferred this petition, accusing the respondent authority of acting arbitrarily, illegally and malafide. 7. The submission of Mr. Dutta, learned counsel for the petitioner is that the respondent RPO has no authority or jurisdiction to deny the issuance of a passport to the petitioner by going into the legality or otherwise of the adoption deed. He submits that the adoption deed has been duly registered. He submits that the RPO cannot question, or sit in judgment over the validity, or otherwise, of the adoption deed. 8. It is argued that the respondent authority does not function as an adjudicating authority, who could rule on the validity or otherwise of the adoption deed. He further submits that the only grounds on which the passport can be refused by the RPO are contained in Section 6 of the Passports Act, 1967, and the ground raised by the RPO, namely, that the adoption deed is not valid is not mentioned as a ground in Section 6 of the Passports Act. 9. It is argued that by declining the passport to the petitioner, the petitioner's fundamental right to travel has been infringed. In support of this submission, learned counsel for the petitioner places reliance upon a decision of the Full Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Pawandeep Singh v. Union of India decided on 07.11.2003, reported as 2003 LawSuit (P&H) 1221, which has been followed subsequently in Satinder Pal Singh Sibia v. Union of India & Anr., 2007 (1) HLR 59. 10. Learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that even otherwise it cannot be said that the adoption deed is not in accordance with the HAMA. It is submitted that Section 9 of HAMA provides that the mother of a child has the capacity to give the child in adoption. He further submits that proviso to Section 9(2) also stands fully satisfied, inasmuch, as, it can be said that the petitioner's natural father has \"finally renounced\" the petitioner's world, inasmuch, as, he had, at the time of obtaining divorce by mutual consent, given up his rights to have anything to do with the petitioner, and he had also renounced his responsibilities towards the petitioner as a father. 11. In support of this submission, learned counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance upon the definition of the expression \"renounce\" and \"renounce the world\" and \"renouncing\", as contained in the Advanced Law Lexicon by P. Ramanatha Aiyar (Third Edition); Black's Law Dictionary (Eighth Edition), and; the Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English (Eighth Edition). 12. He also places reliance on an unreported judgment of the Bombay High Court in Maroti Vitthal Bhatwalkar & Anr. v. Mahila Vikas Mandal, Chandrapur, 2007 (2) AIR Bom R 44, to submit that even when the biological parents are alive, the Court could allow the application of the strangers to take the child in adoption in the interest and welfare of the child. 13. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent submits that the RPO is enjoined by Section 5 of the Passports Act to make such an enquiry as it may consider necessary, and thereafter by an order in writing, either issue the passport or refuse the same. Learned counsel submits that under Section 5(3) of the Passports Act, it is provided that in case a passport is issued with an endorsement or is refused, the passport officer is obliged to record his reasons in brief, which has been done in the present case. 14. He further submits that the Punjab and Haryana High Court while rendering the aforesaid decisions did not consider the opening words of Section 6(1) and 6(2) of the Passports Act, which reads \"Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the passport authority shall refuse .... .... ....\". He submits that apart from the ground specifically mentioned in Section 6, the passport officer can refuse issuance of a passport on the ground that the information furnished by the applicant is incorrect or insufficient, and can require the applicant to resubmit the application by providing the correct and complete information. 15. Learned counsel for the respondent submits that in the petitioner's passport application form, the name of the father was mentioned as that of the adopted father, and not the natural father. During the course of verification of the factual disclosures made in the petitioner's application, the petitioner was required to provide the adoption deed. The adoption deed, though registered, is not valid, since, even a bare perusal of the adoption deed shows that the consent of the natural father has not been obtained, and it is not even the petitioner's case that the petitioner's natural father has either finally renounced the world, or has ceased to be a Hindu, or has been declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be of unsound mind. Reference is made to Section 9(2) of HAMA. 16. It is further argued that merely because the petitioner's father renounced or waived his rights, qua the petitioner, and also gave up his obligations to maintain the petitioner at the time of obtaining divorce by mutual consent, the same cannot be construed as a final renunciation of the world. 17. So far as the submission of the petitioner founded upon the decisions of the Punjab and Haryana High Court is concerned, I reject the same. With utmost respect and with due deference to the Punjab and Haryana High Court, I cannot agree with the view taken in the aforesaid two decisions. 18. In the case of Pawandeep Singh (supra), the passport was refused on the ground that the adoption deed, on the basis of which the passport application was moved, was not valid. In this case, the petitioner was born on 27.08.1989 in Punjab. Both his parents had died by October 1998. His real grandparents gave him in adoption to their other son Shri Satpal Singh and his wife, who were living in Italy, and an adoption deed dated 17.05.1999 was executed and registered in the office of the Sub Registrar, Ludhiana. The respondents contention was that under the provisions of HAMA, Sh. Satpal Singh and his wife, who had sons of their own, could not have adopted the petitioner and, therefore, the adoption was invalid. 19. The Full Bench, after extracting Section 6 of the Passports Act, observed as follows: \"9. A bare perusal of Section 6 afore-mentioned shows that except on four grounds mentioned in Sub Section 1 and nine grounds mentioned in Sub- section 2 of Section 6 on no other ground there could be refusal to grant Passport or travel document. 10. In Ganpathi National Middle School v. M. Durai Khanna, (1996) 6 S.C.C. 464 and State of H.P. v. H.P. State Recognised & Aided Schools Managing Committees and Ors., (1995)4 S.C.C. 507 the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that a child has got a fundamental right of education. In Satwant Singh Sawhney v. D. Ramarathnam, Assistant Passport Officer, A.I.R. 1967 S.C. 1836 it was held to the effect that Article 21 takes in the right of locomotion and to travel abroad. Hidayatullah, J. in his dissenting judgment also considered that there is no doubt a fundamental right to equality in the matter of grant of passports (subject to reasonable classifications). In Mrs. Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, (1978)1 S.C.C. 248, the Apex Court laid down the applicable tests under Article 19 in relation to impounding of passport. Under our constitutional scheme the fundamental right enshrined under Article 21 is available not only to adults or non citizens but also to the minors. The Government cannot deprive the minor's right to have a better education or to live a dignified life, apart from love and affection of his own uncle and Aunt though the stand taken by the Respondents that adoption was not valid is correct since the Aunt and Uncle are having their own sons. This significant aspect of the matter was not considered earlier by the Division Bench. The judgment of the Division Bench has also not considered the provisions of Section 6 of the Act. It is, thus, per inqurium. We are, thus, constrained to overrule this decision. 11. We have no hesitation in holding that the action of the Respondent No. 2 in refusing to grant Passport to the Petitioner in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, is in teeth of Article 14 which is antithesis to any arbitrary action and against the Petitioner's fundamental rights enshrined under Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India\". (Emphasis supplied) 20. With the utmost respect, the Full Bench failed to notice the opening words of Section 6(1) and (2) of the Passports Act. Insofar it is relevant, Section 6 of the Passports Act reads as follows: \"6. Refusal of passports, travel documents, etc. - (1) Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the passport authority shall refuse to make an endorsement for visiting any country under clause (b) or clause (c) of sub- section (2) of section 5 on any one or more of the following grounds, and on no other ground, namely:--  (a) .... .... ....  (b) .... .... ....  (c) .... .... ....  (d) .... .... .... (2) Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the passport authority shall refuse to issue a passport or travel document for visiting any foreign country under clause (c) of sub- section (2) of section 5 on any one or more of the following grounds, and on no other ground, namely:--  (a) .... .... ....  (b) .... .... ....  (c) .... .... ....  .... .... ....  (i) .... .... ......\". 21. The Full Bench also did not notice Section 5(2) and (3) of the Passports Act, which reads as follows: \"5. Applications for passports, travel documents, etc. and orders thereon. - ... .... .... ...... .... ..... ..... ..... ..... ..... ..... ..... (2) On receipt of an application [under this section,] the passport authority, after making such inquiry, if any, as it may consider necessary, shall, subject to the other provisions of this Act, by order in writing,- (a) issue the passport or travel document with endorsement or, as the case may be, make on the passport or travel document the endorsement, in respect of the foreign country or countries specified in the application; or (b) issue the passport or travel document with endorsement, or, as the case may be, make on the passport or travel document the endorsement, in respect of one or more of the foreign countries specified in the application and refuse to make an endorsement in respect of the other country or countries; or (c) refuse to issue the passport or travel document or, as the case may be, refuse to make on the passport or travel document any endorsement. (3) Where the passport authority makes an order under clause (b) or clause (c) of sub- section (2) on the application of any person, it shall record in writing a brief statement of its reasons for making such order and furnish to that person on demand a copy of the same unless in any case the passport authority is of the opinion that it will not be in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of India, friendly relations of India with any foreign country or in the interests of the general public to furnish such copy\". (Emphasis supplied) 22. The observations made by the Full Bench that except for the four grounds mentioned in sub section (1) and nine grounds mentioned in sub section (2) of Section 6, the passport officer could not refuse the passport or travel documents on any other ground, clearly misses the opening words of Section 6(1) and 6(2) \"Subject to the other provisions of this Act ..... ..... ......\". Pertinently, the Full Bench also acknowledges that the stand taken by the passport authority, to the effect that the adoption was not valid, was correct. However, it directed issuance of a passport on considerations of breach of Article 21 of the Constitution, in case the passport was denied to the applicant. 23. An application for seeking issuance of a passport is required to be made under Section 5(1) and on receipt of an application, the passport authority is required to make his enquiry and thereafter pass an order. He may either decide to issue the passport in terms of clause (a) of Section 5(2), or to issue a passport with an endorsement, or refuse to make an endorsement in respect of some countries in terms of clause (b) of Section 5(2), or he may altogether refuse to issue a passport under clause (c) of Section 5(2). In case he passes an order under clause (b) and/or (c) of Section 5(2), he is required to record brief reasons therefor. Therefore, if the details and particulars mentioned in a passport application by an applicant are found to be incorrect or deficient upon a scrutiny of the application and the documents produced in support of it, the passport authority is not obliged to issue a passport, merely because such a case may not be covered by the ground contained in Section 6(1) or 6(2) of the Passports Act. 24. Take, for example, a case where the applicant mentions his wrong name, or wrong name of his parents; his incorrect address; his incorrect date of birth and makes false declaration with regard to such other information, as may be required to be furnished in the application. It is quite possible that none of such information may actually be covered by the grounds contained in clauses (a) to (d) of Section 6(1) or clauses (a) to (i) of Section 6(2) of the Act. Does it mean that the passport authority, despite finding such inaccuracies in the application form, is obliged to issue a passport merely because the ground contained in Section 6(1) and 6(2) are not made out? In my view, the obvious and plain answer has to be a \"No\". 25. The Parliament deliberately used the words \"Subject to the other provisions of this Act\" in Section 6(1) and 6(2) of the Act, to take care of all such situations. In my view, what Section 6(1) and 6(2) of the Act provide is that if the application of the applicant is otherwise found to be complete and truthful in respect of the information required to be provided in the application for issuance of a passport or for seeking an endorsement thereon, the same may still be refused for the grounds mentioned in Section 6(1) and 6(2) respectively. Pertinently, the present cannot be even termed as a refusal to issue a passport to the petitioner altogether. All that the petitioner has been informed is to make correction in the information provided in the application form and to resubmit the same. 26. The fundamental right available under Article 21, which includes the right of locomotion and to travel abroad, is subject to reasonable restrictions. It cannot be said that a citizen has a right to obtain a passport by furnishing incorrect or wrong information with regard to his name, age, address or parentage. He cannot claim that non issuance of the passport with incorrect/false information is infringing his fundamental right of locomotion or to travel abroad. In my view, it cannot be said that the passport authority has no jurisdiction whatsoever to go into the issue of correctness or otherwise of the adoption deed, even in case where, on the face of it, the said adoption deed appears to be in contravention of the law. The enquiry that the passport authority is required to undertake under Section 5 of the Passport Act is a serious enquiry. Such an enquiry cannot be done cursorily or perfunctorily. If, during the course of the enquiry, it comes to the notice of the passport authority that the documents provided by the applicant did not support the claims made by the applicant in his application for issuance of a passport, he would not only be entitled, but would be duty bound to raise the issue with the applicant. A passport is not only a travel document, but is also an identity document. The identity of a person is determined, inter alia, by his parentage. Therefore, unless there is a legal adoption of the applicant, he/she is bound to give the name of his/her natural parents and cannot choose to provide the name of the adopted parent(s) in his/her application form. 27. I now proceed to consider the submissions of learned counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner's adoption deed in favour of Shri Surojit Chattoraj is valid. Sections 9(1) and 9(2) of the HAMA are relevant and reads as follows:- \"9. Persons capable of giving in adoption.- (1) No person except the father or mother or the guardian of a child shall have the capacity to give the child in adoption. (2) Subject to the provisions of sub-section (4), the father or the mother, if alive, shall have equal right to give a son or daughter in adoption: Provided that such right shall not be exercised by either of them save with the consent of the other unless one of them has completely and finally renounced the word or has ceased to be a Hindu or has been declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be of unsound mind.\" 28. From the aforesaid reading, it is clear that both parents of a child, if alive, have equal right to give the child in adoption. Therefore, the right of the petitioner's mother, Smt. Rajeshwari Chattoraj to give the petitioner in adoption cannot be questioned. However, the law is very clear that such right cannot be exercised by either of the parents of the child \"save with the consent of the other, unless one of them has deliberately and finally renounced the world or has ceased to be a Hindu or has been declared by a Court of competent jurisdiction to be of unsound mind.\" Consequently, the consent of the petitioner's natural father was required to give the petitioner in adoption to Surojit Chattoraj. However, such consent would not be necessary if the petitioner's natural father had, inter alia, \"finally renounced the world\". 29. The issue is whether, in the facts of this case, it can be said that the petitioner's father, Shri Abhijit Ghosh has finally renounced the world. 30. The petitioner has placed reliance on the meaning of the expression \"renounce\" and \"renounce the world\" contained in the Advanced Law Lexicon by P. Ramanatha Aiyer 3rd Edition 2007 Reprint. \"Renounce\" is said to mean \"to give up a right; surrender; abandon, refuse to recognize any longer (as) to renounce treaty principles, authority, heirship, etc. \"Renounce the world\" would mean \"to withdraw from worldly interests in order to lead a spiritual life.\" Reference is made to Section 13(1)(vi) of the Hindu Marriage Act. The expression \"renouncing\" means \"making formal resignation of some right or trust especially of one's position as heir or executor\". The Black's Law Dictionary Eighth Edition explains the expression \"renounce\" to mean \"to give up or abandon formally (a right or interest); to disclaim (renounce an inheritance), to refuse to follow or obey; to decline to recognize or observe (renounce one's allegiance)\". The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English defines the expression \"renounce\" as \"consent formally to abandon; surrender; give up ( a claim, right, possession, etc); repudiate; refuse to recognize any longer (renouncing their father's authority); a decline further association or disclaim relationship with (renounced my former friends); withdraw from; discontinue; forsake; refuse or resign a right or position esp., as an heir or trustee\". \"Renounce the world\" means \"abandon society or material affairs.\" 31. From the reading of aforesaid definitions and meaning, no doubt, it could be said that the natural father of the petitioner, Shri Abhijit Ghosh has renounced his rights and obligations qua, the petitioner and the petitioner's mother renounced her rights qua the natural father, Shri Abhijit Ghosh. But can it be said that the petitioner's natural father has \"renounced the world\"? 32. In my view, on a plain grammatical and literal interpretation of the said words, it cannot be said that the petitioner's natural father Shri Abhijit Ghosh has renounced the world, as the renounciation of the world by a person would involve and entail his severing his relationships with all other human beings and would also entail the giving up of all material wealth and pleasures. 33. In Madhusudhan Mohapatra Vs. Gobind Sabat and Another, AIR 1965 Orrisa 54, the High Court takes note of an earlier decision reported as Baldeo Prasad Vs. Arya Pritinidhi Sabha, AIR 1930 ALL 643, where the Court took the view that the mere fact that a person declares that he has become a sanyasi or that he has described himself as such, or wears clothes ordinarily worn by the sanyasis would not make him a perfect sanyasi. He must not only retire from the worldly interests and become dead to the world, but to attain this, he must perform the necessary ceremonies without which the renunciation will not be complete. 34. It is not even the petitioner's case that Shri Abhijit Ghosh has, in that wider and natural sense, renounced the world. All that the petitioner contends is that Shri Abhijit Ghosh, her natural father, has not no concern with the petitioner any longer. Had the intention of the legislature been to exclude the consent of that parent, who may have cut off all his relationship with the minor child, on account of the divorce obtained by the parents, the legislature would not have used the expression \"renounce the world\" but would have used the words like \"severed his or her relationship with the minor child\" instead. It is not for this Court to read into the plain language used by the legislature, words which are not there. 35. The petitioner's mother could not have secured the right, at the time of her obtaining divorce from Shri Abhijit Ghosh, to claim that the petitioner was not the naturally born child of her natural father, Shri Abhijit Ghosh. The petitioner's mother also could not have taken away the petitioner's right to claim that Shri Abhijit Ghosh is her natural father. The petitioner's right to claim her status as the daughter and an heir of Shri Abhijit Ghosh also could not have been taken away by her mother by entering into a compromise with her natural father. The rights which inhere in the petitioner on account of her being a natural heir of her natural father continue to survive. The identity of the petitioner is derived by the fact that the petitioner is the naturally born child of her parents i.e. Shri Abhijit Ghosh and Smt. Rajeshwari Ghosh, now known as Smt. Rajeshwari Chattoraj. The settlement arrived at between the petitioner's parents at the time when they obtained the divorce cannot be said to include an implied consent by the petitioner's father to the giving in adoption of the petitioner to any other person. 36. The decision relied upon by the petitioner in the case of Maroti Vitthal Bhatwalkar (supra), though founded upon a different factual matrix does support the petitioner's argument. However, I have difficulty following the said decision in the light of the clear and express language used in Sections 5 and 6 of the HAMA. These provisions read as follows:- \"5. Adoptions to be regulated by this Chapter- (1) No adoption shall be made after the commencement of this Act by or to a Hindu except in accordance with the provisions contained in this Chapter, and any adoption made in contravention of the said provisions shall be void. (2) An adoption which is void shall neither create any rights in the adoptive family in favour of any person which he or she could not have acquired except by reason of the adoption, nor destroy the rights of any person in the family of his or her birth. 6. Requisites of a valid adoption.- No adoption shall be valid unless- (i) the person adopting has the capacity, and also the right, to take in adoption; (ii) the person giving in adoption has the capacity to do so; (iii) the person adopted is capable of being taken in adoption; and (iv) the adoption is made in compliance with the other conditions mentioned in this Chapter.\" 37. It is pertinent to note that both Sections 5 and 6 of the HAMA begin with the words \"no adoption shall be made........\" and \"no adoption shall be valid unless.........\" It is, therefore, clear that both these provisions are mandatory. From a reading of Section 5, it is clear that an adoption not made in accordance with the provisions of Chapter II of the HAMA is void. The adoption is not valid unless the person giving in adoption has the capacity to do so and the adoption is made in compliance with the conditions mentioned in Chapter II of the HAMA, which would include the condition mentioned in the proviso to Section 9(2) of the said Act. 38. For all the aforesaid reasons, I dismiss this petition leaving it open to the petitioner to comply with the objections raised by the RPO and to resubmit her application with the correct details, inter alia, with regard to her parentage. The parties are left to bear their respective costs. (VIPIN SANGHI) JUDGE MARCH 30, 2012 sr/as"

        "query-text": "Dear Sir/Madam,    My father (called as 2nd party) had a 40' * 60' property in Bangalore which he bought from 1st party in 1993. Another person (3rd party) claimed ownership by proceding a sale deed from the very same 1st party in the year 2013.     However 3 years ago, the property share between 2nd party and 3rd party was settled through mutual consent, in the ratio of 3:1. 75% property - Portion A to 2nd party (my father) and 25% property - Portion B to the 3rd party by court, through a compromise decree.    This bifurcation of Portion A and Portion B has not happened in documents/sub-registrar yet. Sub-registrar mentions that an execution decree is needed to consider bifurcation, and the EC (encumbarance) on the entire land shows up currently under the name of 3rd party.    Now the 3rd party has come forward to sell his share (25% property) to us (2nd party). Though this looks rosy, i want to understand the correct process to execute and register the same.    I believe we need to open the court suite, and file a petition to cancel the sale deed of the 3rd party. Do let me know if there is any other alternative.    Is it needed that once the 3rd parties' sale deed is cancelled through court case/order, does the property need to be re-registered by us (2nd party)?    Do we need to again pay the stamp duty and registration fees?    Will the Encumberance (EC) reflect 2nd parties name automatically, once the sale deed of the 3rd party is cancelled? OR any further step to be executed?    Does any other checks- newspaper advertisement/checks at sub-registrar need to be peformed, to ensure no other transaction has happened, behind the walls without our knowledge, before 2nd party makes a payment to the 3rd party.

                "response-text": "Dear Sir/Ma'am, Since, the bifurcation of the property has not been registered in the documents or with the sub registrar, I shall suggest you to go through the following procedures for the registration of your share of the land.  Without registration, a buyer has no legal right over the property so, one cannot sell it to anyone under the Transfer of Property Rights Act. Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908, mandates that documents of immovable property need to be compulsorily registered. Therefore, it is suggested to go through the procedure mentioned below. Procedure of Registration  The property documents that need to be registered, should be submitted to the office of the Sub-Registrar of Assurances within whose jurisdiction the property, which is the subject matter of transfer, is situated. The authorised signatories for the seller and the purchaser, have to be present along with two witnesses, for registration of the documents. The signatories should carry their proof of identity. The documents that are accepted for this purpose, include Aadhaar Card, PAN Card, or any other proof of identity issued by a government authority. The signatories also have to furnish the power of authority, if they are representing someone else.  You need to present the property card to the sub-registrar, along with the original documents and proof of payment of stamp duty. Before registering the documents, the sub-registrar will verify whether adequate stamp duty has been paid for the property, as per the stamp duty ready reckoner. In case there is any deficit in the stamp duty, the registrar will refuse to register the documents. Note here that witnesses are quite important in the overall process. The two witnesses that you intend to present during the registration, will also have to establish their identity in front of the sub-registrar. For this purpose, they should also carry their ID proofs and their address proofs. Additionally, their biometric identity will also be scanned during the process.  Execution  Execution is the enforcement of a decree by a judicial process which enables the decree-holder to realize the fruits of the decree and judgment passed by the competent Court in his favour. The Registration Act and Transfer of property Act deals with the manner in which the title in the property can be transferred. An important aspect of execution of a document is attestation of the document. Similarly, section 17 of Registration Act provides the list of documents which require compulsory registration.  Execution of Sale deeds  Execution of the sale deed is technically the concluding part of property-purchase process. After a buyer and a seller reach an agreement, they first execute an agreement to sell, a document that sets the terms and conditions based on which the future transaction will take place. A sale deed, also referred to as conveyance deed, is the main document in a transaction of sale and purchase of property. A sale deed acts as the main legal document that evidences the sale and transfer of ownership of property in favour of the buyer from the seller. It also acts as the main document for further sale by the buyer as it establishes his proof of ownership of the property. Through the sale deed, the transferor transfers his rights to the transferee. The transferee or the purchaser then acquires absolute ownership of the property. A sale deed is executed after the execution of the agreement to sell, and after compliance of various terms and conditions detailed in the agreement to sell as agreed upon between the buyer and seller.    Order XXIII Rule 3 CPC pertaining to the compromise of the suit: \"Compromise of suit: Where it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that a suit has been adjusted wholly or in part by any lawful agreement or compromise, in writing and signed by the parties or where the defendant satisfies the plaintiff in respect of the whole or any part of the subject-matter of the suit, the Court shall order such agreement, compromise or satisfaction to be recorded and shall pass a decree in accordance therewith so far as it relates to the parties to the suit, whether or not \"the subject-matter of the agreement, compromise or satisfaction is the same as the subject matter of the suit.\" Since, the compromise decree between the 2nd and the 3rd party had been cancelled by the court, this means that the sale deed between 1st and 3rd party and the bifurcation of the property is again a matter of dispute. In this case, whether the sale deed is executed or not, to avoid any risk, registration of land is mandatory before any such sale."

A partition deed for a property is executed to divide the property among different people - usually among the family members. A partition is a division of a property held jointly by several persons, so that each person gets a share and becomes the owner of the share allotted to him. It is done by dividing the property according to the shares to which each of the parties is entitled to in law as applicable to them. In case a partition is by mutual consent, a partition deed is executed by the co-owners. The partition deed is required to be registered at the office of the sub-registrar of the place where the property is situated. A partition deed creates new owners of a property and needs to be registered at the office of the sub-registrar to give it a legal and binding effect. The deed should in particular mention the date from which the partition is effective. The names of the parties and their respective shares should be specifically mentioned. The stamp duty payable in such a case is Rs 1,000 for each share of the property. Further, the registration fee will be Rs 500 in Mumbai, Maharashtra.

The bench said the three essentials of a gift under Mohammadan Law are (i) declaration of the gift by the donor (2) acceptance of the gift by the donee and (3) delivery of possession. \"Though the rules of Mohammadan Law do not make writing essential to the validity of a gift, an oral gift fulfilling all the three essentials make the gift complete and irrevocable. However, the donor may record the transaction of gift in writing. In our opinion, merely because the gift is reduced to writing by a Mohammadan instead of it having been made orally, such writing does not become a formal document or instrument of gift. When a gift could be made by Mohammadan orally, its nature and character is not changed because of it having been made by a written document. What is important for a valid gift under Mohammadan Law is that three essential requisites must be fulfilled,\" Justice Lodha writing the judgement said. The apex court passed the judgement while upholding the appeal filed by Yakub challenging the High Court's ruling which had set aside a Visakhapatnam trial court decree that no such registeration was required.

The same matter was also put up to National Human Rights Commission and National Woman Commission in the same week, and till date no action on our complain.      the matter is very clearly mentioned in the complain and also proofs are provided.      The complaint is as follows:      I have purchased a flat in Ranchi, Jharkhand, in Feb 2019.      The family was staying in the flat and I was working far from home at Jaipur, the neighbors started fighting and threatening to kill for some dispute for the common area which is only up to the door bell of my flat. which in all means belong to me, as the gate door is part of the flat and not the common area.   We got threatened and left with the family for Jaipur in the month of July 2019.       There was no intimation by the other flat owners regarding the association formed for aforesaid maintenance of the common area till now.       They used to call every month for maintenance charges, and threat me for the consequences many a times on working hours and mostly during meeting from different numbers, one day out of frustration there was exchange of some foul words, as they threatened to harm me and my family.      In the meanwhile we visited Ranchi for some work related to bank in the month of February 2020. As we reached the flat we found that the power was not available and the D G was not working and so we used the stairs to get to the flat with luggage, which is on the third floor. We found that Power was disconnected of the flat from the Electricity meter. Water connection was also found disconnected, I set right both the problems myself, It is obvious that they have disconnected the Water and Electricity of my flat. All the neighbors started asking why are you here and again threatened us, so we left Ranchi once again.      Now, they started bullying and threatening on the whatsapp group of the unregistered society, on which I raised an obligation, they started to threaten me with cutting down of the water connection and Electricity connection and to harm me physically. It is very difficult situation as I have been devoid to use the property and now, they are demanding maintenance charges for the unregistered society.    On asking for rules, regulations and legal notice for the dues they are not ready to listen for anything.      I belong to the backward community and the other party is full of so called forward people, they also commented on my backward class.      Please give the way ahead.      Police, NHRC and NWC are not taking any action in the case,       What should be done now?      Thanks,      Regards,",

Originally This property was bought from a SBI (state bank Of India) Distress property auction, it was bought by me as an individual NRI. And was supposed to be registered on my individual name    a close friend of mine helped me to get a buyer for this property and sold it for 9.11 cr. To one of his business partner And asked me to register this property on a company name    with some manipulation the property was registered on a Pvt Ltd company so it can be easily sold without getting into hassle of transfer fee etc.   he further requested to help him with 2.5 Cr which he will return me in a year time.   So the arrangement was made that out of 9.11 Cr. 2.5 will go to my friend and balance 7.61 cr will be given to me.   I received 2.5 Cr. And balance was gives as PDC chqs. Of 3 months by the buyer, also my friend made a loan contract and issued me few PDC chqs of 2.5 Cr for a year.   upon this agreements and a payment of 2.5 Cr. And PDC. My close friend requested that you are flying out of India why don't you transfer the company to the buyers and handover all original documents, since they are my business partner there is no doubt on them. I was satisfied with the buyers initiatives and PDC chqs with a notarized contract, I transferred the property (company XYZ Pvt Ltd.) to the buyer    after 3 months at my surprise all chqs given by the buyer were bounced and I stared chasing him for final payment being out of india.   After a chase of almost a year they decided to return this property back to me and asked their 2.5 Cr. Which they gave me via bank transfer.   My same close friend arranged an another buyer for the same price (9.11) since I was stuck in this deal this time my friend asked me to help him with 3 Cr. So the new buyer agreed to pay 2.5 cr. To the old buyer and 3 cr. To be given to my close friend and balance to me. Again my close friend issued me PDC chqs and a notarized contract to acknowledge the loan of 3 cr.   2.5 cr. Was paid back to old buyer and the company was transferred to the new buyer also they handed over all original documents of the property to new buyer.   the buyer asked me to sign a notarized contract that I have received all payments and I don't have any claim/dues on this property. He transferred 5 Cr (2.5 to old buyer and 2.5 to me) and some 80 lakhs in cash, also he gave me 2 chqs of 50k Rs. For share transfer of that company, out of these 2 chq one chq of 50k Rs was not paid   later he denied the balance payment saying there were some dues on this property and he spent that rest of the amount   also the chqs of 3cr given by my friends are not yet cleared, he hasnt paid that payment and has been requesting more time    those 2 buyers were the business partner with my friend and were doing all this with a plan of adjusting their due amount from my friend.   1 buyer had to take 2.5 cr and",

You may see the following law on GPA and also consult property advocate with all your documents since you are investing huge amount in purchasing the property. =============================================================================== No property sale on power of attorney: Supreme Court Property sales through the common practice of general power of attorney (GPA) will not give ownership title to the buyer. In a landmark judgment that is expected to send a large number of property owners into a tizzy, the Supreme Court held that the GPA method of immovableproperty sales is not a valid form of transfer of property. A three-judge bench presided over by Justice R. V. Raveendran said that property can be lawfully transferred only through registered sale deeds. \"A power of attorney is not an instrument of transfer in regard to any right, title or interest in an immovable property,\" the bench said, after interpreting various provisions of the law concerning property sales. However, the bench said the judgment will not affect \"genuine transactions\" under the GPA. The judgment delivered on Wednesday would have an impact on both freehold and leasehold properties and affect the mode of transfer of property in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) where GPA sales are very common. Even though it can cause some hardship to those who have already purchased property through the GPA, the order will help curb evasion of duties, flow of black money into real estate and also save people from being cheated by unscrupulous owners selling the same property to several people.

The principal has to obtain a \"live\" certificate with his photograph affixed to it from a registered medical practitioner or a gazetted officer. These certificates are valid for 30 days.As per a recent order of the inspector general of registration, the new rules are applicable to all POAs registered from February 4. By law, POA is not valid once the principal dies. Section 34 of Tamil Nadu Registration Act says it is the duty of the sub-registrar to ascertain whether the POA holder has the right to execute a transaction on behalf of the principal. But sub-registrars register property documents without bothering to verify whether the principals were alive.\"In Tamil Nadu, where a large number of land transactions are carried out on the basis of POAs to circumvent payment of stamp duty and registration fees. Many instances have been reported of POA holders selling land after the death of the principal. Buyers get into trouble when legal heirs of the principal claim rights over the property. Such cases end up in protracted legal battles and ultimately the sale deeds are declared invalid,\" said a senior official.There have been instances of people impersonating land owners and executing fraudulent POAs. In one case, land worth 9 crore on Venkatnarayana Road was sold to a business group based on a POA, reportedly executed by the land owner in 2008. Legal heirs of the land owner subsequently filed a case of forgery against the business group, brokers and others involved in the deal as the owner had died 28 years earlier. When police refused to take prompt action, the owners moved the court. As per law, the principal also has the right to rescind a POA. \"If there is a mention of a consideration (amount) in the POA, the holder can claim that money through legal means. But he cannot claim rights over the property once the POA is rescinded or the principal dies,\" said the official.In 2010-11, more than 3.75 lakh POAs were registered across Tamil Nadu for property-related transactions. The number came down to 1.8 lakh last year. It is going up again this year, said the official."

Developer made partial payments during the yr but could not make full payment.He requested extnsn multiple times. With each extnsn request,he provided security cheques with revised payment amount as per agreed terms.   Developer revoked PoA by sending a letter & gave some other undrconstruction flats as collateral & promised to close transaction in next 4 mnths.(for some of these flats he did not get permission from PMC & hence were not constructed)   Once again,Developer requested for another extension,after taking request letter & fresh PDCs.(I had no option but to cooperate with d builder).This time Developer offered his Shares (equivalent to amount payable)(via a signed agreement without Notarizing it). He said their Pvt Ltd Co.was about to be acquired by another firm & his money will get released which he can use to pay me back.The last extension was done in July 2022.   After this Developer started avoiding meeting n phone calls,so we had to deposit the security cheques as validity expired in Oct 2022.All cheques were Dis-honored. I sent a legal notice for the same U/s 138.   Developer replied to this notice saying that he was expecting an interest rate of 9-11% pa & he has already paid the interest+principle amt based on his assumption & the cheques were for security only. Developer now is threatening to take legal action under Maharashtra Money Lending Act as excessive interest is charged.We supported the Developer for more than 4 yrs & now he is playing a new trick to avoid balance payment.The original MOU clearly mentions 18% interest as agreed return on invstmnt,also he has repeatedly provided cheques with calculation as per 18%.

Her parents were rude to me blaming i am not taking care of her properly inspite of me explaining them about her, they abused and blackmailed me as well.

I am raised by single parent, my mom is retired govt employee as her service time is less she is not eligible for pension. She got heart stroke due to my marriage due to which i wanted to take her complete responsibility as elder son by sending her 20k ( my salary is 60k) every month for her rent/medicals/maid/groceries etc. My wife doesnt want me to take care of my mom and refuses me from sending her money, I am living seperately from my mom just because i am afraid that my wife would harm my mom as she is violent and doesnt like my mom.

Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code states that \u201cwhoever attempts to commit suicide and does any act towards the commission of such an offense shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with a fine or with both. Many people who experience suicidal thoughts do not die by suicide, although they may exhibit suicidal behavior or make suicide attempts. People who find themselves experiencing suicidal thoughts or behaviors may find that they do so as a result of conditions such as depression, hopelessness, severe anxiety, insomnia, or panic attacks. Not all people who are diagnosed with these or other medical or mental health conditions will experience suicidal ideation, but some may. A person may have thoughts of suicide for no discernable reason, but often suicidal ideation may occur as a symptom or result of a mental health condition or after one experiences a challenging life event, such as a failed or failing relationship(s); grief; medical illness; rejection; sexual abuse, emotional abuse, or physical abuse; or unemployment. If a person is determined to kill him/herself, nothing is going to stop them. Most suicidal people do not want death; they want the pain to stop. The impulse to end it all, however overpowering, does not last forever. Consult a Physiatrist and psychologist. Psychologist can solve her mental emotion and Physiatrist can solve her physical imbalance like hormone variations .Proper communication is also the best medicine. Mental disorders occupy a premier position in the matrix of causation of suicide.  Under section 340 B, if a married woman dies within seven years of her marriage in suspicious circumstances and it is proved that she was subjected to harassment, then the husband and his relatives can be punished. They may face imprisonment from seven years to life. The husband knows that if his wife commits suicide or attempts to commit suicide, then he will be definitely roped in the offences of Section 304B or 498A of the Indian Penal Code and then continues to live in a shadow of unspoken fear. A solitary instance can be considered as an outburst of the anger or frustration. However, if such threats are given intermittently, then the husband definitely suffers a psychological trauma of remaining under constant fear that his wife is likely to commit suicide if things go against her If repeated threats are given by the wife and if the preparations for suicide are made, though having no intention to commit, but with an intention to create a pressure or with a view to gain the expected result from the husband, then it amounts to cruelty."

The important ingredients for capital gains are, therefore, existence of a capital asset, transfer of such capital asset and profits or gains that arise from such transfer. All transfer of capital assets attracts capital gains. Capital assets are those properties that have an enduring value and they are not consumable. To neutralize the erosion of value of money over the years the cost index for the year of sale is factored in while calculating the cost of investment so that the impact of inflation is neutralized and only the actual gain to the seller is brought to tax. Long term Capital gains are computed by deducting from the full value of consideration for the transfer of a capital asset the following : - Expenditure connected exclusively with the transfer; - The indexed cost of acquisition of the asset, and - The indexed cost of improvement, if any, of that asset. In the case of shares, expenditure in connection with the transfer includes the stock broker\u2019s commission but the salary of an employee is not deducted in computing capital gains though the employee may have helped in the transfer of the shares. Cost of acquisition, in such cases includes the price-paid, cost of share transfer stamps, cost of postage for sending the shares for transfer to the transfer-agents of the company, legal expenses etc. As per section 54 of income tax act, in case the asset transferred is a long term capital asset being a residential house, and if out of the capital gains, a new residential house is constructed within 3 years, or purchased 1 year before or 2 years after the date of transfer, then exemption on the LTCG is available on the amount of investment in the new asset to the extent of the capital gains. It may be noted that the amount of capital gains not appropriated towards purchase or construction may be deposited in the Capital Gains Account Scheme of a public sector bank before the due date of filing of Income Tax Return. This amount should subsequently be used for purchase or construction of a new house within 3 years. Section 54F: When the asset transferred is a long term capital asset other than a residential house, and if out of the consideration, investment in purchase or construction of a residential house is made within the specified time as in sec. 54, then exemption from the capital gains will be available as: (i) If cost of new asset is greater than the net consideration received, the entire capital gain is exempt. (ii) Otherwise, exemption = Capital Gains x Cost of new asset/Net consideration. It may be noted that this exemption is not available, if on the date of transfer, the assessee owns any house other than the new asset. It may be noted that the Finance Act 2000 has provided that with effect from assessment year 2001-2002, the above exemption shall not be available if assessee owns more than one residential house, other than new asset, on the date of transfer. Investment in the Capital Gains Account Scheme may be made as in Sec.54."

You have the option to call the police by just dialing the police number 100 and police will come to the place mentioned by you in the phone call. They will come to the spot and ask you the problem and then will take the action against them. And, when they will reach the spot you should be having sufficient proof to prove the harassment by neighbors. Harassment Through Nuisance You may be living in an apartment or in a duplex, often it happens, when you hear loud music sound from the neighbor\u2019s house, you try to ignore that sound for as long as possible but sometimes, such noise may make life difficult. This type of nuisance is defined in Section 268 of the Indian Penal Act. Section 268 of the Indian Penal Code defines nuisance when the person is guilty of a public nuisance when he does any act which causes injury, danger or annoyance to the public or the people in general who live or occupy the property in the neighborhood. A common nuisance is not excused on the ground that it causes some convenience or advantage. If this type of harassment is faced by you from your neighbor then, you can file an application under Section 268 of IPC in the court of magistrate. Punishment of nuisance is defined in Section 290 of IPC, which is mere Rs. 200 but the court can do much more. As a matter of fact, calling 100 is most effective as, after a visit or two from the police, such nuisance is likely to stop. In extreme cases, police may even confiscate the instruments that are used to cause nuisance like \u2013 loudspeakers or sound boxes, or drones, cameras or such other tools. Sometimes, police does not intervene despite laws being there as they do not like extra work on their plate or because the other party is very influential. In such cases, you may need to take help of legal experts."

II) Hindu marriage act will not apply to your case as your wife is a parsi by religion and only Special Marriage Act will be applicable in your case. III) Section 28 of Special Marriage Act will be applicable to your case in case both the parties are applying for Mutual consent Divorce.  The Synopsis of relevant sections of Marriage Act(Hindu Marriage Act and Special Marriage Act) is produced here under for reference. 1) Hindu marriage act -  1a. Section 2(1) of Hindu Marriage act -This section therefore applies to Hindus by religion in any of its forms and Hindus within the extended meaning i.e. Buddhist, Jaina or Sikh and in fact, applies to all such persons domiciled in the country who are not Muslims, Christians, Parsi or Jew, unless it is proved that such persons are not governed by the Act under any custom or usage. The Act applies to Hindus outside the territory of India only if such a Hindu is domiciled in the territory of India 2) The Special Marriage Act, 1954 (the Act), was enacted to provide a special form of marriage, to persons in India, and Indian nationals abroad, irrespective of the faith which either party to the marriage may profess.  3) Under sec. 28 of the Act, which primarily deals with the provisions relating to obtaining a divorce by mutual consent in respect of a marriage solemnized and/or registered under the Act, a petition for divorce by mutual consent may be presented to the District Court.  4). A few key points to be considered while seeking a divorce by mutual consent are as follows: 4a) . A petition for divorce must be presented to the District Court by both parties together. 4b) The petition must be on the grounds, i) that they have been living separately for a period of one year or more, ii) that they have not been able to live together, and iii) that they have mutually agreed that the marriage should be dissolved.

A806 at Samethana Lakefront Apartments, Samethanahalli owned by SPL Housing   to us through a broker named Azam([deleted],[deleted]), on 24th May,2015.      The flat was incomplete and many works were pending. Mr.Bharadwaj (employee of SPL) and Azam agreed orally that the work will be completed within 3 weeks and registration and possession will be given within 3 weeks.      1. Flat cost was Rs. 31,75000 including registration which we contacted PNB Housing through the Builder and they agreed a home loan of 2678000lakhs and on 27th May 2015, the loan was approved.      2. Paid the advance amount of 6 lakhs by cheque on 25th May, 2015 against the flat No. A-806 which was incomplete.      3. Paid the remaining 35000 by cheque again on 1st June 2015.       4. The buider agreed for July 5th to do the house warming ceremony.       5. Got call from Bharadwaj to issue cheque for releasing the loan amount from bank. Even got threatened when asked for more time for the same.      6. Cheques were issued immediately and 95% of the loan amount was released to the builder.      7. But urfortunately on July 5th, the work was not even started.      8. And from other workers we got to know that the builder is not going to do any work on that apartment.      9. Builder later agreed that and was ready to give another flat which is A203 and it was ready to occupy.      10. We informed the bank about this swap via mail and call. Bank associate told us on call that they will collect the required documents from the builder about the swap.      11. We insisted the builder about doing the agreement again but he informed us that it will take a long time in banking process and it's better to go for registration which we trusted but later came to know he was cheating.      12. We have done the pooja for A203 and started living      13. So We have an agreement on Flat A806, But we are living in A203.      14. On further pressure applied on builder, They provided a NOC for A203.      15. Later, we got to know that A203 is Mortgaged with City Union Bank.      16. Now and always builder is asking for more time again and again which is going endlessly.         In a nutshell, we paid 32 lakh Rs for a flat and paying the EMI but the flat is still not registered in our name and the same flat in mortgaged with another bank which was hidden to us.         Registered office of the Builder: #33-44/1&2, 8th Main, 4th Cross, RMV Extension, Sadashivnagar , Bangalore - 560080         Kindly let me know what all legal action can be taken in this regard, Both against the bank and builder.      Is it possible to stop the EMI till the registration is done? What are the steps to stop the ECS         Thanks,   Rahul",

If the accused is found guilty at the conclusion of the trial, he must be present in person to receive the sentence. Also, his presence is necessary if imprisonment is to be enforced. Further, the supremacy of the law will be questionable if there is no formal process to bring the required persons before the court. For this reason,CrPC provides three ways for compelling the appearance of any person who is required to be present in the court, in the court -  1.\tSummons,  2.\tWarrant, and  3.\tProclamation for person absconding A Summons is a process issued by a Court, calling upon a person to appear before a Magistrate. It is used for the purpose of notifying an individual of his legal obligation to appear before the Magistrate as a response to a violation of the law. It is addressed to a defendant in a legal proceeding. the summons will announce to the person to whom it is directed that a legal proceeding has been started against that person, and that a file has been started in the court records. The summons announces a date and time on which the person must appear in court. A person who is summoned is legally bound to appear before the court on the given date and time. Willful disobedience is liable to be punished under Section 174 of IPC. It is a ground for contempt of court.As per Section 61, every summons issued by a Court under this Code shall be in writing and in duplicate. It must be signed by the presiding officer of the Court or by such other officer as the High Court may, from time to time, by rule direct. It must also bear the seal of the Court. The summons should contain adequate particulars such as the date, time, and place, of the offence charged. It should also contain the date, time, and place where the summoned person is supposed to appear. The standard format of a summons is given in Form 1 of Second schedule. As per Section 205, a magistrate issuing the summons may permit the accused to appear by his lawyer if he sees reason to do so. Warrant A written order issued by a judicial officer or other authorized person commanding a law enforcement officer to perform some act incident to the administration of justice.Warrant is used to bring persons to court who have ignored a subpoena or a court appearance.A warrant of arrest is a written authority given by a competent magistrate for the arrest of a person. It is a more drastic step than the issue of a summons. It is addressed to a person, usually a police officer, to apprehend and produce the offender in front of the court.  Essential Elements of a valid warrant -  1. The warrant must clearly mention the name and other particulars of the person to be arrested. As per Section 70(1), every warrant of arrest shall be in writing. It must be signed by the presiding officer of the court and must bear the seal of the court. As per section 70(2), a warrant remains in force until it is canceled or is executed. Normally, Form 2 of Second schedule is used to write a warrant. 2. It must show the person to whom the authority to arrest has been given. As per Section 72, a warrant is normally directed to one or more police officers but, if necessary, the court may direct it to any other person or persons. Further, section 73 provides that a magistrate may direct a warrant to any person within his jurisdiction for the arrest of any escaped convict, proclaimed offender, or of any person who is accused of a non-bailable offence and is evading arrest.  3. It may include a direction that if the person arrested under the warrant executes a bond and gives security for his attendance in court, he shall be released. Warrant with such a direction is called as bailable warrant of arrest. 4. It must clearly specify the offence. It is mandatory to present the Accused before the court. In the case of IPC 420 IPC, is a major offence, non-bailable, and cognisible ( police can arrest without warrant ), punishable with imprisonment for 7 years.but if the investigation is over you should take an undertaking and seek bail."

There are some incidents that happen in your life and those incidents are so strong that they change your DNA. At times, despite our best efforts, life takes a turn for the worst. We may have wanted different things from life, but life\u2019s got its own plan as well. A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that\u2019s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. Marriages are hard. Divorces\u2026even harder. Nobody enters marriage thinking about a divorce in the end. If some are unable to cope with the harsh realities of marriage, the only viable option in front of them is to approach the Court and seek legal separation. I have come across many cases like this. Under Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, the parties can seek divorce by mutual consent by filing a petition before the court. Mutual consent means that both the parties agree for peaceful separation. Mutual Consent Divorce is a simple way of coming out of the marriage and dissolve it legally. Important requirement is the mutual consent of the husband & wife. There are two aspects on which Husband & Wife have to reach to consensus. One is the alimony or maintenance issues. As per Law there is no minimum or maximum limit of maintenance. It could be any figure or no figure. Next important consideration is the Child Custody. This can also be worked out effectively between the parties. Child Custody in Mutual Consent Divorce can be shared or joint or exclusive depending upon the understanding of the spouses. Contested divorce petition can also be filed if grounds are available. As you know not everyone has the financial capability to afford expenses incurred in legal procedures. It is not justified if justice is compromised due to the differences of \u2018rich and poor\u2019.

On 11 May 2019, my parents are staying in New Edaiyur (Mamalapuram) and they were assaulted by a neighbor,his wife and his son due to some financial matter. The neighbour is a distant relative and he is working in a central government office and he is studying in MIT, chennai. On 11 May 2019, he assaulted my father and verbally abused my mother and he lifted his lungi in the public place to insult my further, which is an obscene behavior. On the same day, we have filed a complaint in the police station and I have also e-mailed about this incident to the central government office and the educational institution requesting disciplinary action/inquiry against a neighbour and his son considering the insecurity of my parents\u2019 safety. On 21 May 2019, police interrogated about the case on 21 May 2019 and advised to settle the case amicably without filing FIR but warned both that they will face serious consequences in terms of job & education if they involve in police enquiry again.       On 23 May 2019, I have updated about the status of the case the central government office and the educational institution and requested the status of disciplinary action/inquiry against a neighbour and his son. Now, both of them were called by the central government office and the educational institution for inquiry. An aggressive neibhbour is threatening us to files police case against our family for the actions initiated by central government office and the educational institution. The requests to central government office and the educational institution were purely to provide information about the assault/ obsecene behaviours/ of neighbour & his family to the institutions and ensure they are not causing any harm to my parents in future since I am away from home. Bothe the central government office and the educational institution did not acknowledge my e-mails. However, they started their actions and I am not aware of the outcome of actions initiated by these institutions.       Is it an offence to send a request for inquiry/ disciplinary action mails to central government office and the educational institution based on the actual facts/information?   Can the police file a case for sending a request for inquiry/ disciplinary action mails to central government office and the educational institution?   Is it possible to file a case without knowing the outcome of actions initiated by central government office and the educational institution?   If there is a false compliant by a neighbor, how to challenge the case?    Can I request the help of these institutions, if there is any false police complaint against us?

If you want to file for speedy trial in high court in Andhra Pradesh, you can take the following steps:   Collect evidence: You should collect all the relevant evidence to support your claim for speedy trial, such as:  Your petition and documents filed in the family court The orders and proceedings of the family court The dates and reasons for any delay or adjournment in the family court The impact of the delay on your health, finances, reputation, or rights   Consult a lawyer: You should consult a lawyer who is well-versed in family laws and writ petitions. You should explain your case to the lawyer and seek his or her advice on the best course of action. You should also ask the lawyer about the fees, time frame, and chances of success of your case.  File a writ petition: You should file a writ petition in the High Court of Andhra Pradesh under Article 226 of the Constitution of India seeking a writ of mandamus directing the family court to expedite the trial of your divorce case. You should also seek an interim order staying any further delay or adjournment in the family court pending disposal of your writ petition. You should submit your evidence and documents along with your writ petition. You should also cite the relevant provisions of law and precedents that support your claim for speedy trial, such as:  Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which guarantees the right to life and personal liberty, which includes the right to speedy trial. Section 21-B of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, which provides that every petition under this Act shall be tried as expeditiously as possible and endeavour shall be made to conclude the trial within six months from the date of service of notice of the petition. Section 19 (6) of the Family Courts Act, 1984, which provides that every suit or proceeding shall be disposed of as expeditiously as possible and endeavour shall be made to conclude the trial within six months from the date of service of summons. The guidelines issued by the Supreme Court in various cases such as Hussainara Khatoon v. State of Bihar, P. Ramachandra Rao v. State of Karnataka, Anil Rai v. State of Bihar, etc.   These are some of the steps that you can take to file for speedy trial in high court in Andhra Pradesh."

I met Ms.K parents in 2006 as I wished to her marry her, they including Ms.K denied this relationship and said I belonged to lower caste.   2 yrs ago I met a girl Ms.S and after a year of knowing each other I decided to move on. Ms.K came to know that I was moving on through a comman friend. Since then she has been calling and wants to meet me regularly. She spoke to her parents that she wants to marry me and her parents said no to this relationship as I belong to a different & lower caste. To convince her parents and stop me from moving on she found a way out \"SUICIDE.\"   On the 14th February she had her first attempt by consuming a bottle full of pills and tried to hang herself. Her parents agreed but she couldn't hold me back. When my parents heard of her attempt they supported her and the parents spoke among themselves and decided all the dates without my knowledge. Even then I did not agree, she started to threaten to drag me and my parents to court.   I was left with no choice but to agree and got married to Ms.K In april 2015. Since then we have been arguing everyday and when I speak to the girl I wanted to marry she threatens on more suicide attempts. The girl I wanted to marry Ms.S chose to move on and I was left with Ms.K. For the past 6 months there have been 4 suicide attempts and multiple arguments. She leaves for her home town promising never to return, but shows up at my house within 10 to 15 days.   She abused Ms.S who left and sent her messages full of threats. I want an annulment from this marriage as soon as possible. My work and my parents have suffered a lot. I can't see this happening anymore. I want a way out and I want my parents & family members to be unhurt.   Please advise.",

                "response-text": "Judicial separation is an instrument devised under law to afford some time for introspection to both the parties to a troubled marriage. Law allows an opportunity to both the husband and the wife to think about the continuance of their relationship while at the same time directing them to live separate, thus allowing them the much needed space and independence to choose their path. The provision for judicial separation is contained in section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 A decree for judicial separation can be sought on all those ground on which decree for dissolution of marriage, i.e. divorce can be sought, and one among them is insanity. Even where a decree for judicial separation is passed in favour of the husband, maintenance may still be awarded to a wife. Though section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act does not provide any time as to how long judicial separation can last. But section 13 of the Act provides that if there is no resumption of co-habitation between the parties one year after the decree for judicial separation is passed, the parties can get a decree for divorce on this ground itself. But divorce on this ground will be given only when one year has expired after the passing of the decree for judicial separation and not earlier. Thus judicial separation is one option before you now.  You can apply for it on the grounds of cruelty. Definition of Cruelty: Treated the petitioner with such cruelty as to cause a reasonable apprehension in the mind of the petitioner that it will be harmful or injurious for the petitioner to live with the other party. Cruelty contemplated by the aforesaid clause may be both physical and mental. Mental cruelty must be of such a nature that the parties cannot reasonably be expected to live together. The situation must be such that the wronged party cannot reasonably be asked to put in with such conduct and continue to live with the other party. Judicial or legal separation permits the parties to a marriage to live apart. It is a relief short of actual dissolution of marriage. So long as the decree is in force the parties to the marriage are permitted to live apart and it shall no longer be obligatory for either party to cohabit with the other. Now you can decide further course of action."

In my opinion the court cannot pass an order to impound passport for such reasons.  Sub-section (3)(e) of Section 10 of the Act provides for impounding of a passport if proceedings in respect of an offence alleged to have been committed by the holder of the passport or travel document are pending before a criminal court in India. Thus, the Passport Authority has the power to impound the passport under the Act. Section 102 of Cr.P.C. gives powers to the police officer to seize any property which may be alleged or suspected to have been stolen or which may be found under circumstances which create suspicion of the commission of any offence. Sub-section (5) of Section 165 of Cr.P.C. provides that the copies of record made under sub-section (1) or sub-section (3) shall forthwith be sent to the nearest Magistrate empowered to take cognizance to the offence whereas Section 104 of Cr.P.C. authorizes the court to impound any document or thing produced before it under the Code. Section 165 of Cr.P.C. does not speak about the passport which has been searched and seized as in the present case. It does not speak about the documents found in search, but copies of the records prepared under sub-section (1) and sub-section (3). Impound means to keep in custody of the law. \tThe Act being a specific Act whereas Section 104 of Cr.P.C. is a general provision for impounding any document or thing, it shall prevail over that Section in the Cr.P.C. as regards the passport. Thus, by necessary implication, the power of Court to impound any document or thing produced before it would exclude passport.  Section 10A of the Act which provides for an order to suspend with immediate effect any passport or travel document; such other appropriate order which may have the effect of rendering any passport or travel document invalid, for a period not exceeding four weeks, if the Central Government or any designated officer on its satisfaction holds that it is necessary in public interest to do without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in Section 10 by approaching the Central Government or any designated officer. Therefore, it appears that the passport of the appellant cannot be impounded except by the Passport Authority in accordance with law."

I have notified the landlord through email that I want to move on. My notice period is 2 months. But I decided to move within a month. Now my landlord is asking for the last month's rent and refusing to settle it against the security deposit. He is also threatening to lock me out. Can he kick me out for just the last month's rent that is during the notice period? I am already in the process of moving and I would be done in at most three more days. I have already paid the rent up to the last month.      I had brought the problem of water dripping to his notice by email 8 months back, continued exchanges of several emails during this time and he failed to resolve the issue. My understanding is, I don't even have to pay the rent for the full notice period, I only have to pay for the time I am actually living in the flat, because of unlivable conditions. Not only is he not agreeing to that, he is demanding this month's rent which is in the notice period and refusing to adjust it against the security deposit. My monthly rent is 17200 and the security deposit is 60000.      Can I sue him for threatening me?

The Learned XI Additional City Civil & Sessions Judge, (CBI Cases Relating to Banks and Financial Institutions), Chennai, while passing the impugned order on 24.6.2014 in Crl.M.P.No.1680 of 2014 in C.C.No.22 of 1997 (filed by the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8), had inter alia, observed that ..... The present petition has been filed without any bona fide. No purpose will be served by calling for documents, which are admittedly considered by the prosecution to the effect that they are not available in the Court records. This matter has already been decided by this Court in an earlier petition filed by A.1 and A.2 in Crl.M.P.No.5021 of 2013 dated 8.1.2014 and this fact is well known to the Petitioners/Accused and the present Petition is filed only to protract the disposal of the case and the steps taken by the Petitioners frivolously with a mala fide intention has to be taken into consideration by the Court very seriously and resultantly dismissed the petition by ordering an exemplary cost of Rs.10,000/- to be borne by the Petitioners equally, i.e., Rs.5,000/- each to be deposited with the Tamil Nadu Legal Services Authority, Chennai. 3. Assailing the correctness of order of dismissal passed by the trial Court in Crl.M.P.No.1680 of 2014 in C.C.No.22 of 1997, the Learned Counsel for the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8 urges before this Court that the original complaints should have been sent along with the F.I.Rs to the Court and as such, it forms part of 'Court Records' and as such, the said 'Records' are to be maintained pending trial. 4. Advancing his arguments, the Learned Counsel for the Petitioners contends that the trial Court had categorically admitted that nine F.I.Rs. were registered on the basis of nine written complaints by the respective Managers. However, it had on an erroneous view rejected the Miscellaneous Petition (filed by the Petitioners) which had ultimately resulted in serious miscarriage of Justice. 5. The Learned Counsel for the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8 relies on the order of this Court reported in (CDJ 2013 MHC 5619) K.RAMAJEYAM Vs. STATE REP. BY THE INSPECTOR OF POLICE, THIRUVALLORE DISTRICT, whereby and whereunder in paragraphs 6, 10 and 11, it is observed as under: 6. The learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that copies of documents which ought to have been furnished to the accused by the committal Court under Section 207 Cr.P.C since were not given, it can be sought for from the Sessions Court. The documents sought for are necessary for the accused to make effective defence. Such furnishing of copies of documents is right of the accused and it is part of principle of fair trial. In support of his submissions, the learned counsel also cited V.K. SASIKALA Vs. State rep. by SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE (2012 (9) SCC 771). 10. No man shall be deprived of his life and liberty except by procedure established by law\" is constitutionally guaranteed to everyone. (See Article 21, Constitution of India). Only after following a 'fair, reasonable and equitable procedure', the liberty of a person can be curtailed in accordance with law (see MANEKA GANDHI VS. UNION OF INDIA, AIR 1978 SC 25). Right of the accused to defend himself as against the accusations made against him is constitutionally guaranteed (see Article 22, Constitution of India). 11. No one shall be condemned unheard. Before condemning a person, reasonable opportunity must be given to him. If only the basis of accusations, materials are revealed the indicted person can defend himself effectively. Without furnishing, disclosing him copies of the incriminating materials asking him to defend will be an empty formality. It is really not giving him opportunity much less a reasonable opportunity. It is as good as denying him opportunity. These are foundations of principles of justice and fair play. These are basis of principles of natural justice. 6. Also, the Learned Counsel for the Petitioners in the aforesaid decision refers to paragraphs 14 and 15 whereby and whereunder, it is observed as follows: 14. Section 207 Cr.P.C., runs as under: \"207. Supply to the accused of copy of police report and other documents.- In any case where the proceeding has been instituted on a police report, the Magistrate shall, without delay, furnish to the accused, free of cost, a copy of each of the following:- (i) the police report; (ii) the first information report recorded under Section 154; (iii) the statements recorded under sub-section (3) of Section 161 of all persons whom the prosecution proposes to examine as its witnesses, excluding therefrom any part in regard to which a request for such exclusion has been made by police officer under sub-section (6) of Section 173; (iv) the confessions and statements, if any, recorded under Section 164; (v) any other document or relevant extract thereof forwarded to the Magistrate with the police report under sub-section (5) of Section 173: Provided that the Magistrate may, after perusing any such part of a statement as is referred to in clause (iii) and considering the reasons given by the police officer for the request, direct that a copy of that part of the statement or of such portion thereof as the Magistrate thinks proper, shall be furnished to the accused: Provided further that if the Magistrate is satisfied that any document referred to in clause (v) is voluminous, he shall, instead of furnishing the accused with a copy thereof, direct that he will only be allowed to inspect it either personally or through pleader in Court.\" 15. The said provisions are commonly applicable to all type of cases instituted upon police reports. In fact, only upon complying the requirement of Section 207 Cr.PC., a Magistrate can commit the case to the Court of Sessions. (see Section 209 Cr.P.C). Section 208 Cr.P.C., is similar provision applicable to sessions cases instituted upon private complaints. Such compliance is condition precedent for commitment of the cases to the Court of Sessions. If the copies of the documents mentioned in Section 207 Cr.P.C., are not supplied to the accused either in full or in part, he cannot effectively defend himself before the trial Court, namely, Sessions Court. 7. The Learned Counsel for the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8 proceeds to submit that the right of the Accused to receive the 'Documents/statements' submitted before the Court is absolute and it must be adhered to by the Complainant. Apart from that, it is the primordial duty of the Court of Law to ensure the supply of 'Documents/statements' to the Accused in accordance with Law. 8. Expatiating his plea, the Learned Counsel for the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8 contends that to claim the documents within the ambit of Sections 207, 243 read with the provisions of Section 173 in its entirety and the power of the Court under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code to summon the documents signifies and provides precepts which would govern the right of the Accused to claim the copies of the statements and documents which the prosecution had collected during investigation and upon which they rely upon. 9. The Learned Counsel for the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8 strenuously submits that furnishing of copies of the documents is the duty of the Court and even documents which were forwarded to the Court and which are not relied upon by the prosecution may be of assistance to the Accused to prove his innocence. 10. Further, it is represented on behalf of the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8 that even if the requisite documents are not forwarded to the concerned competent Court by the prosecution/Police and the same are still with the Police, then, it becomes the duty of the Court to direct the Police to produce those documents to the Court and subsequently, it is for the Court to furnish the copies of the same to the Accused. 11. The Learned Counsel for the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8 seeks in aid of the Judgment reported in (CDJ 2012 BHC 2503) KAMAL AHMED MOHAMMED VAKIL ANSARI & OTHERS Vs. THE STATE OF MAHARASHTRA whereby and whereunder in paragraphs 52, 53 and 60, it is observed and held as under: 52. The refusal of the trial court to direct the Nodal Officers to file affidavits in support of their claims that the relevant data was not available was improper and not in accordance with law. If the court did not want the Nodal Officers to file the affidavits, it could have itself questioned the Nodal Officers on oath in that regard and could have recorded their evidence with liberty to the prosecution and to the accused, to question them further in that regard. Infact, such a course would have been proper and would be rather inevitable if the court wanted to feel satisfied about Nonavailability of such record. 53. The impugned orders are clearly wrong. The trial court should have considered the likelihood of the relevant CDRs being available with the investigating agency, and ought to have considered the application for issue of search warrants in the light of the various stands taken by the prosecution / investigating agency, in that regard, from time to time. It need not have been at once satisfied, that there exists no such record which the accused wanted to get produced. Similarly, accepting the contents of the letters brought by Nodal Officers, as true, without requiring them to state the material facts on oath, was also not proper. Further, whether it was possible to retrieve the data with the help of the Information Technology Department of the concerned Mobile Service Provider Companies, needed serious consideration, and the trial did not apply its mind to this aspect. 60. As regard the availability of the relevant documents with the investigating agency, though no conclusion at this stage can be arrived at by this court, the fact remains that the matter needs to be further considered by the trial court. If, on such further consideration of the matter, the trial court comes to the conclusion that the investigating agency can be believed to be in possession of such records, then it should consider the prayer of the accused persons to issue a search warrant to search for the relevant records. 12. The Learned Counsel for the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8 invites the attention of this Court to the Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in (CDJ 2012 SC 654) V.K.SASIKALA Vs. STATE REP BY SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE wherein in paragraphs 217, 218, 219, 220 and 221, it is observed as follows: 217. Further, Section 91 empowers the court to summon production of any document or thing which the court considers necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or another proceeding under the provisions of the Code. Where Section 91 read with Section 243 says that if the accused is called upon to enter his defence and produce his evidence there he has also been given the right to apply to the court for issuance of process for compelling the attendance of any witness for the purpose of examination, cross-examination or the production of any document or other thing for which the court has to pass a reasoned order. 218. The liberty of an accused cannot be interfered with except under due process of law. The expression due process of law shall deem to include fairness in trial. The court (sic Code) gives a right to the accused to receive all documents and statements as well as to move an application for production of any record or witness in support of his case. This constitutional mandate and statutory rights given to the accused place an implied obligation upon the prosecution (prosecution and the Prosecutor) to make fair disclosure. The concept of fair disclosure would take in its ambit furnishing of a document which the prosecution relies upon whether filed in court or not. That document should essentially be furnished to the accused and even in the cases where during investigation a document is bona fide obtained by the investigating agency and in the opinion of the Prosecutor is relevant and would help in arriving at the truth, that document should also be disclosed to the accused. 219. The role and obligation of the Prosecutor particularly in relation to disclosure cannot be equated under our law to that prevalent under the English system as aforereferred to. But at the same time, the demand for a fair trial cannot be ignored. It may be of different consequences where a document which has been obtained suspiciously, fraudulently or by causing undue advantage to the accused during investigation such document could be denied in the discretion of the Prosecutor to the accused whether the prosecution relies or not upon such documents, however in other cases the obligation to disclose would be more certain. As already noticed the provisions of Section 207 have a material bearing on this subject and make an interesting reading. This provision not only require or mandate that the court without delay and free of cost should furnish to the accused copies of the police report, first information report, statements, confessional statements of the persons recorded under Section 161 whom the prosecution wishes to examine as witnesses, of course, excluding any part of a statement or document as contemplated under Section 173(6) of the Code, any other document or relevant extract thereof which has been submitted to the Magistrate by the police under sub-section (5) of Section 173. In contradistinction to the provisions of Section 173, where the legislature has used the expression documents on which the prosecution relies are not used under Section 207 of the Code. Therefore, the provisions of Section 207 of the Code will have to be given liberal and relevant meaning so as to achieve its object. Not only this, the documents submitted to the Magistrate along with the report under Section 173(5) would deem to include the documents which have to be sent to the Magistrate during the course of investigation as per the requirement of Section 170(2) of the Code. 220. The right of the accused with regard to disclosure of documents is a limited right but is codified and is the very foundation of a fair investigation and trial. On such matters, the accused cannot claim an indefeasible legal right to claim every document of the police file or even the portions which are permitted to be excluded from the documents annexed to the report under Section 173(2) as per orders of the court. But certain rights of the accused flow both from the codified law as well as from equitable concepts of the constitutional jurisdiction, as substantial variation to such procedure would frustrate the very basis of a fair trial. To claim documents within the purview of scope of Sections 207, 243 read with the provisions of Section 173 in its entirety and power of the court under Section 91 of the Code to summon documents signifies and provides precepts which will govern the right of the accused to claim copies of the statement and documents which the prosecution has collected during investigation and upon which they rely. 221. It will be difficult for the Court to say that the accused has no right to claim copies of the documents or request the Court for production of a document which is part of the general diary subject to satisfying the basic ingredients of law stated therein. A document which has been obtained bona fide and has bearing on the case of the prosecution and in the opinion of the Public Prosecutor, the same should be disclosed to the accused in the interest of justice and fair investigation and trial should be furnished to the accused. Then that document should be disclosed to the accused giving him chance of fair defence, particularly when non-production or disclosure of such a document would affect administration of criminal justice and the defence of the accused prejudicially. 13. Also, in the aforesaid Judgment, at paragraphs 17, 19 and 20 it is observed as follows: 17. The issue that has emerged before us is, therefore, somewhat larger than what has been projected by the State and what has been dealt with by the High Court. The question arising would no longer be one of compliance or non-compliance with the provisions of Section 207 Cr.P.C. and would travel beyond the confines of the strict language of the provisions of the Cr.P.C. and touch upon the larger doctrine of a free and fair trial that has been painstakingly built up by the courts on a purposive interpretation of Article 21 of the Constitution. It is not the stage of making of the request; the efflux of time that has occurred or the prior conduct of the accused that is material. What is of significance is if in a given situation the accused comes to the court contending that some papers forwarded to the Court by the investigating agency have not been exhibited by the prosecution as the same favours the accused the court must concede a right to in the accused to have an access to the said documents, if so claimed. This, according to us, is the core issue in the case which must be answered affirmatively. In this regard, we would like to be specific in saying that we find it difficult to agree with the view taken by the High Court that the accused must be made to await the conclusion of the trial to test the plea of prejudice that he may have raised. Such a plea must be answered at the earliest and certainly before the conclusion of the trial, even though it may be raised by the accused belately. This is how the scales of justice in our Criminal Jurisprudence have to be balanced. 19. Any debate or discussion with regard to the purport and object of the examination of an accused under Section 313 Cr.P.C. is wholly unnecessary as the law in this regard is fairly well settled by a long line of the decisions of this Court. The examination of an accused under Section 313 Cr.P.C. not only provides the accused an opportunity to explain the incriminating circumstances appearing against him in the prosecution evidence but such examination also permits him to put forward his own version, if he so chooses, with regard to his involvement or otherwise in the crime alleged against him. Viewed from the latter point of view, the examination of an accused under Section 313 Cr.P.C. does have a fair nexus with the defence that he may choose to bring, if the need arises. Any failure on the part of the accused to put forward his version of the case in his examination under Section 313 Cr.P.C. may have the effect of curtailing his rights in the event the accused chooses to take up a specific defence and examine defence witnesses. Besides, the answers given by the accused in his examination, if incorrect or incomplete, may also jeopardise him as such incorrect or incomplete answers may have the effect of strengthening the prosecution case against the accused. In this connection it may be appropriate to refer to two paragraphs of the judgment of this Court in Manu Sao Vs. State of Bihar (2010 (12) SCC 3100) which are extracted below:- 13. As already noticed, the object of recording the statement of the accused under Section 313 of the Code is to put all incriminating evidence against the accused so as to provide him an opportunity to explain such incriminating circumstances appearing against him in the evidence of the prosecution. At the same time, also to permit him to put forward his own version or reasons, if he so chooses, in relation to his involvement or otherwise in the crime. The court has been empowered to examine the accused but only after the prosecution evidence has been concluded. It is a mandatory obligation upon the court and besides ensuring the compliance therewith the court has to keep in mind that the accused gets a fair chance to explain his conduct. The option lies with the accused to maintain silence coupled with simpliciter denial or in the alternative to explain his version and reasons for his alleged involvement in the commission of crime. This is the statement which the accused makes without fear or right of the other party to cross-examine him. However, if the statements made are false, the court is entitled to draw adverse inferences and pass consequential orders, as may be called for, in accordance with law. The primary purpose is to establish a direct dialogue between the court and the accused and to put to the accused every important incriminating piece of evidence and grant him an opportunity to answer and explain. Once such a statement is recorded, the next question that has to be considered by the court is to what extent and consequences such statement can be used during the enquiry and the trial. Over the period of time, the courts have explained this concept and now it has attained, more or less, certainty in the field of criminal jurisprudence. 14. The statement of the accused can be used to test the veracity of the exculpatory nature of the admission, if any, made by the accused. It can be taken into consideration in any enquiry or trial but still it is not strictly evidence in the case. The provisions of Section 313(4) explicitly provides that the answers given by the accused may be taken into consideration in such enquiry or trial and put in evidence against the accused in any other enquiry or trial for any other offence for which such answers may tend to show he has committed. In other words, the use is permissible as per the provisions of the Code but has its own limitations. The courts may rely on a portion of the statement of the accused and find him guilty in consideration of the other evidence against him led by the prosecution, however, such statements made under this section should not be considered in isolation but in conjunction with evidence adduced by the prosecution. 20. If the above is the avowed purport and object of the examination of an accused under Section 313 Cr.P.C., we do not see as to how the appellant (second accused) can be denied an access to the documents in respect of which prayers have been made in the applications dated 29.3.2012 (for certified copies of the unmarked documents) and dated 18.4.2012 (for inspection) before the learned trial Court. While the anxiety to bring the trial to its earliest conclusion has to be shared it is fundamental that in the process none of the well entrenched principles of law that have been laboriously built by illuminating judicial precedents is sacrificed or compromised. In no circumstance, the cause of justice can be made to suffer, though, undoubtedly, it is highly desirable that the finality of any trial is achieved in the quickest possible time. In view of what has been stated above and to balance the need to bring the prosecution in the present case to its earliest conclusion and at the same time to protect and preserve the right of the accused to a fair trial we are of the view that the following directions would take care of the conflicting interests that have surfaced in the present case:- (1) The accused No.2, i.e. the appellant herein, be allowed an inspection of the unmarked and unexhibited documents referred to by her in the application dated 29.3.2012, i.e., IA No. 711 of 2012 in CC No.2008/2004 filed in the Court of XXXVI Additional City Civil & Sessions Judge, Bangalore; (2) Such inspection will be completed within a period of 21 days from the date of receipt of this order by the learned trial court. The venue of such inspection and also the persons who will be permitted to be present at the time of inspection will be decided by the learned trial court. (3) The right of inspection conferred by this order will not affect the validity of any part of the trial till date, including, the examination of the accused No.1 under Section 313 Cr.P.C. which has since been completed or any part of such examination of the second accused that may have been completed in the meantime. (4) In the event the third and the fourth accused also desire inspection of the unmarked and unexhibited documents such inspection will be allowed by the learned trial court. In such an event the process of inspection will also be simultaneously carried out and completed within the period of 21 days stipulated in the present order. 14. Conversely, the Learned Counsel for the Respondent/Complainant contends that the original complaints relating to the F.I.Rs. in the case are at present not available in the original records of the case and also that the original F.I.Rs in the case were already marked as Exhibits P.1289 to P.1297 without any objection from the side of the Petitioners. 15. The Learned Counsel for the Respondent/Complainant projects his argument that the main case is about 27 years old and in this case, the arguments on the side of the Prosecution were completed and written arguments were also submitted on 10.1.2013. Furthermore, on 28.1.2013, the argument on the side of A.20 was completed and on 29.1.2013, the argument on the side of A.14 was completed. Added further, on 30.1.2013, the arguments on the side of A.5, A.15 and A.18 were completed. In fact, on 1.2.2013, the argument of A.22 was completed and 4.2.2013, the argument of A.13 and A.19 were completed. 16. It is not in dispute that the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8 filed Crl.M.P.No.1680 of 2014 in C.C.No.22 of 1997 on the file of the trial Court under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which speaks of Summons to produce document or other thing. 17. It cannot be gainsaid that the powers conferred under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code are enabling in character and aimed at arming the Court of any Officer-in-charge of the Police Station to enforce and to ensure the production of any document or other things, necessary or desirable, for the purpose of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code, by issuing a summon or a written order to those in possession of such material. 18. The jurisdiction under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code when invoked by the Accused, the desirability and necessity of the same will have to be looked into by a Court of Law mainly in the context of the purpose, i.e., 1. investigation, 2. inquiry, 3. trial or other proceedings under the Code. 19. In fact, the ingredients of Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code clearly enjoin that it concerns with documents forming the subject of a criminal offence, as also with the documents, which can be pressed into service in evidence to assist or support prosecution. 20. It is true that the Court of Law is bound to consider whether there is a prima facie case for summoning whether these documents are relevant and whether they do have a bearing in a given case. If the Court thinks they are, then, it can order production. Also that a Court may also consider whether the documents etc., are being suppressed or may be tampered with or destroyed by a litigant in whose possession it is or may be entirely lost. 21. Whether certain documents ought to be summoned or not is essentially in the discretion of trial Court. Indeed, except for very good reasons, the High Court should not interfere with that discretion as per the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in (AIR 1970 SC 962) ASSISTANT CUSTOMS COLLECTOR, BOMBAY Vs. L.R.MALWANI. 22. Where the documents have no relevance to the case on hand, nor it is desirable for the Court to summon, the Court is quite competent enough to negative the relief sought for in the petition, as opined by this Court. 23. As far as the present case is concerned that even though the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8 filed the Crl.M.P.No.1680 of 2014 in C.C.No.22 of 1997 under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the very fact that they are not available in the 'Court Records' and also in view of the fact that the Respondent/Complainant has averred in the counter before this Court in Crl.O.P.No.18997 of 2014 to the effect that, the then Public Prosecutor had also filed a memo before the trial Court that it was difficult to trace the original complaints and the same was part of Court records, this Court is of the considered view that the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8 can take advantage of the said fact before the trial Court at the time of the arguments of the main case in C.C.No.22 of 1997 and to seek the appropriate remedy in the manner known to law and in accordance with law, if they so desire/advised. That apart, since the said original nine F.I.Rs. are not available and also that the F.I.Rs. were marked as Exhibits P.1289 to P.1297 before the trial Court on behalf of the Respondent/Complainant, then this Court is of the considered view the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8 can take advantage of the same and to seek appropriate remedy thereto. 24. Although it would have been desirable on the part of the Respondent/Complainant to mark the original complaints, yet in view of the established fact as on date the said nine complainants are not available, then this Court is of the considered view that no useful purpose would be served in allowing the Crl.M.P.No.1680 of 2014 filed by the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8. Per contra, the same would result in an otiose one. Viewed in that perspective, the Criminal Original Petition fails. 25. Insofar as the direction issued by the trial Court in Crl.M.P.No.1680 of 2014 in C.C.No.22 of 1997 through its order dated 24.6.2014 that the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8 should deposit a sum of Rs.5,000/- each to the Tamil Nadu Legal Services Authority, Chennai as an exemplary cost, this Court, taking note of overall conspectus and attendant facts and circumstances of the present case in an encircling fashion, comes to an irresistible conclusion that the ends of justice would be met, if this Court orders the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8 each of them to pay Rs.2,500/- to the Tamil Nadu Legal Services Authority, Chennai, within two weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order and accordingly, directs them to pay a sum of Rs.2,500/- each to the Tamil Nadu Legal Services Authority, Chennai, within fourteen days from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. 26. It is made clear that the dismissal of the present Criminal Original Petition by this Court will not preclude the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8 to raise all the factual and legal pleas before the trial Court at the time of the arguments of the main case in C.C.No.22 of 1997 (including non marking of the original complaints) and to seek appropriate remedy in accordance with law, if they so desire/advised. 27. In the result, the criminal original petition is dismissed. Connected M.P.No.1 of 2014 is closed. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11.8.2014 INDEX : YES/NO INTERNET : YES/NO lan To: 1.

The Learned XI Additional City Civil & Sessions Judge, (CBI Cases Relating to Banks and Financial Institutions), Chennai, while passing the impugned order on 24.6.2014 in Crl.M.P.No.1680 of 2014 in C.C.No.22 of 1997 (filed by the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8), had inter alia, observed that ..... The present petition has been filed without any bona fide. No purpose will be served by calling for documents, which are admittedly considered by the prosecution to the effect that they are not available in the Court records. This matter has already been decided by this Court in an earlier petition filed by A.1 and A.2 in Crl.M.P.No.5021 of 2013 dated 8.1.2014 and this fact is well known to the Petitioners/Accused and the present Petition is filed only to protract the disposal of the case and the steps taken by the Petitioners frivolously with a mala fide intention has to be taken into consideration by the Court very seriously and resultantly dismissed the petition by ordering an exemplary cost of Rs.10,000/- to be borne by the Petitioners equally, i.e., Rs.5,000/- each to be deposited with the Tamil Nadu Legal Services Authority, Chennai. 3. Assailing the correctness of order of dismissal passed by the trial Court in Crl.M.P.No.1680 of 2014 in C.C.No.22 of 1997, the Learned Counsel for the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8 urges before this Court that the original complaints should have been sent along with the F.I.Rs to the Court and as such, it forms part of 'Court Records' and as such, the said 'Records' are to be maintained pending trial. 4. Advancing his arguments, the Learned Counsel for the Petitioners contends that the trial Court had categorically admitted that nine F.I.Rs. were registered on the basis of nine written complaints by the respective Managers. However, it had on an erroneous view rejected the Miscellaneous Petition (filed by the Petitioners) which had ultimately resulted in serious miscarriage of Justice. 5. The Learned Counsel for the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8 relies on the order of this Court reported in (CDJ 2013 MHC 5619) K.RAMAJEYAM Vs. STATE REP. BY THE INSPECTOR OF POLICE, THIRUVALLORE DISTRICT, whereby and whereunder in paragraphs 6, 10 and 11, it is observed as under: 6. The learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that copies of documents which ought to have been furnished to the accused by the committal Court under Section 207 Cr.P.C since were not given, it can be sought for from the Sessions Court. The documents sought for are necessary for the accused to make effective defence. Such furnishing of copies of documents is right of the accused and it is part of principle of fair trial. In support of his submissions, the learned counsel also cited V.K. SASIKALA Vs. State rep. by SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE (2012 (9) SCC 771). 10. No man shall be deprived of his life and liberty except by procedure established by law\" is constitutionally guaranteed to everyone. (See Article 21, Constitution of India). Only after following a 'fair, reasonable and equitable procedure', the liberty of a person can be curtailed in accordance with law (see MANEKA GANDHI VS. UNION OF INDIA, AIR 1978 SC 25). Right of the accused to defend himself as against the accusations made against him is constitutionally guaranteed (see Article 22, Constitution of India). 11. No one shall be condemned unheard. Before condemning a person, reasonable opportunity must be given to him. If only the basis of accusations, materials are revealed the indicted person can defend himself effectively. Without furnishing, disclosing him copies of the incriminating materials asking him to defend will be an empty formality. It is really not giving him opportunity much less a reasonable opportunity. It is as good as denying him opportunity. These are foundations of principles of justice and fair play. These are basis of principles of natural justice. 6. Also, the Learned Counsel for the Petitioners in the aforesaid decision refers to paragraphs 14 and 15 whereby and whereunder, it is observed as follows: 14. Section 207 Cr.P.C., runs as under: \"207. Supply to the accused of copy of police report and other documents.- In any case where the proceeding has been instituted on a police report, the Magistrate shall, without delay, furnish to the accused, free of cost, a copy of each of the following:- (i) the police report; (ii) the first information report recorded under Section 154; (iii) the statements recorded under sub-section (3) of Section 161 of all persons whom the prosecution proposes to examine as its witnesses, excluding therefrom any part in regard to which a request for such exclusion has been made by police officer under sub-section (6) of Section 173; (iv) the confessions and statements, if any, recorded under Section 164; (v) any other document or relevant extract thereof forwarded to the Magistrate with the police report under sub-section (5) of Section 173: Provided that the Magistrate may, after perusing any such part of a statement as is referred to in clause (iii) and considering the reasons given by the police officer for the request, direct that a copy of that part of the statement or of such portion thereof as the Magistrate thinks proper, shall be furnished to the accused: Provided further that if the Magistrate is satisfied that any document referred to in clause (v) is voluminous, he shall, instead of furnishing the accused with a copy thereof, direct that he will only be allowed to inspect it either personally or through pleader in Court.\" 15. The said provisions are commonly applicable to all type of cases instituted upon police reports. In fact, only upon complying the requirement of Section 207 Cr.PC., a Magistrate can commit the case to the Court of Sessions. (see Section 209 Cr.P.C). Section 208 Cr.P.C., is similar provision applicable to sessions cases instituted upon private complaints. Such compliance is condition precedent for commitment of the cases to the Court of Sessions. If the copies of the documents mentioned in Section 207 Cr.P.C., are not supplied to the accused either in full or in part, he cannot effectively defend himself before the trial Court, namely, Sessions Court. 7. The Learned Counsel for the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8 proceeds to submit that the right of the Accused to receive the 'Documents/statements' submitted before the Court is absolute and it must be adhered to by the Complainant. Apart from that, it is the primordial duty of the Court of Law to ensure the supply of 'Documents/statements' to the Accused in accordance with Law. 8. Expatiating his plea, the Learned Counsel for the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8 contends that to claim the documents within the ambit of Sections 207, 243 read with the provisions of Section 173 in its entirety and the power of the Court under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code to summon the documents signifies and provides precepts which would govern the right of the Accused to claim the copies of the statements and documents which the prosecution had collected during investigation and upon which they rely upon. 9. The Learned Counsel for the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8 strenuously submits that furnishing of copies of the documents is the duty of the Court and even documents which were forwarded to the Court and which are not relied upon by the prosecution may be of assistance to the Accused to prove his innocence. 10. Further, it is represented on behalf of the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8 that even if the requisite documents are not forwarded to the concerned competent Court by the prosecution/Police and the same are still with the Police, then, it becomes the duty of the Court to direct the Police to produce those documents to the Court and subsequently, it is for the Court to furnish the copies of the same to the Accused. 11. The Learned Counsel for the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8 seeks in aid of the Judgment reported in (CDJ 2012 BHC 2503) KAMAL AHMED MOHAMMED VAKIL ANSARI & OTHERS Vs. THE STATE OF MAHARASHTRA whereby and whereunder in paragraphs 52, 53 and 60, it is observed and held as under: 52. The refusal of the trial court to direct the Nodal Officers to file affidavits in support of their claims that the relevant data was not available was improper and not in accordance with law. If the court did not want the Nodal Officers to file the affidavits, it could have itself questioned the Nodal Officers on oath in that regard and could have recorded their evidence with liberty to the prosecution and to the accused, to question them further in that regard. Infact, such a course would have been proper and would be rather inevitable if the court wanted to feel satisfied about Nonavailability of such record. 53. The impugned orders are clearly wrong. The trial court should have considered the likelihood of the relevant CDRs being available with the investigating agency, and ought to have considered the application for issue of search warrants in the light of the various stands taken by the prosecution / investigating agency, in that regard, from time to time. It need not have been at once satisfied, that there exists no such record which the accused wanted to get produced. Similarly, accepting the contents of the letters brought by Nodal Officers, as true, without requiring them to state the material facts on oath, was also not proper. Further, whether it was possible to retrieve the data with the help of the Information Technology Department of the concerned Mobile Service Provider Companies, needed serious consideration, and the trial did not apply its mind to this aspect. 60. As regard the availability of the relevant documents with the investigating agency, though no conclusion at this stage can be arrived at by this court, the fact remains that the matter needs to be further considered by the trial court. If, on such further consideration of the matter, the trial court comes to the conclusion that the investigating agency can be believed to be in possession of such records, then it should consider the prayer of the accused persons to issue a search warrant to search for the relevant records. 12. The Learned Counsel for the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8 invites the attention of this Court to the Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in (CDJ 2012 SC 654) V.K.SASIKALA Vs. STATE REP BY SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE wherein in paragraphs 217, 218, 219, 220 and 221, it is observed as follows: 217. Further, Section 91 empowers the court to summon production of any document or thing which the court considers necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or another proceeding under the provisions of the Code. Where Section 91 read with Section 243 says that if the accused is called upon to enter his defence and produce his evidence there he has also been given the right to apply to the court for issuance of process for compelling the attendance of any witness for the purpose of examination, cross-examination or the production of any document or other thing for which the court has to pass a reasoned order. 218. The liberty of an accused cannot be interfered with except under due process of law. The expression due process of law shall deem to include fairness in trial. The court (sic Code) gives a right to the accused to receive all documents and statements as well as to move an application for production of any record or witness in support of his case. This constitutional mandate and statutory rights given to the accused place an implied obligation upon the prosecution (prosecution and the Prosecutor) to make fair disclosure. The concept of fair disclosure would take in its ambit furnishing of a document which the prosecution relies upon whether filed in court or not. That document should essentially be furnished to the accused and even in the cases where during investigation a document is bona fide obtained by the investigating agency and in the opinion of the Prosecutor is relevant and would help in arriving at the truth, that document should also be disclosed to the accused. 219. The role and obligation of the Prosecutor particularly in relation to disclosure cannot be equated under our law to that prevalent under the English system as aforereferred to. But at the same time, the demand for a fair trial cannot be ignored. It may be of different consequences where a document which has been obtained suspiciously, fraudulently or by causing undue advantage to the accused during investigation such document could be denied in the discretion of the Prosecutor to the accused whether the prosecution relies or not upon such documents, however in other cases the obligation to disclose would be more certain. As already noticed the provisions of Section 207 have a material bearing on this subject and make an interesting reading. This provision not only require or mandate that the court without delay and free of cost should furnish to the accused copies of the police report, first information report, statements, confessional statements of the persons recorded under Section 161 whom the prosecution wishes to examine as witnesses, of course, excluding any part of a statement or document as contemplated under Section 173(6) of the Code, any other document or relevant extract thereof which has been submitted to the Magistrate by the police under sub-section (5) of Section 173. In contradistinction to the provisions of Section 173, where the legislature has used the expression documents on which the prosecution relies are not used under Section 207 of the Code. Therefore, the provisions of Section 207 of the Code will have to be given liberal and relevant meaning so as to achieve its object. Not only this, the documents submitted to the Magistrate along with the report under Section 173(5) would deem to include the documents which have to be sent to the Magistrate during the course of investigation as per the requirement of Section 170(2) of the Code. 220. The right of the accused with regard to disclosure of documents is a limited right but is codified and is the very foundation of a fair investigation and trial. On such matters, the accused cannot claim an indefeasible legal right to claim every document of the police file or even the portions which are permitted to be excluded from the documents annexed to the report under Section 173(2) as per orders of the court. But certain rights of the accused flow both from the codified law as well as from equitable concepts of the constitutional jurisdiction, as substantial variation to such procedure would frustrate the very basis of a fair trial. To claim documents within the purview of scope of Sections 207, 243 read with the provisions of Section 173 in its entirety and power of the court under Section 91 of the Code to summon documents signifies and provides precepts which will govern the right of the accused to claim copies of the statement and documents which the prosecution has collected during investigation and upon which they rely. 221. It will be difficult for the Court to say that the accused has no right to claim copies of the documents or request the Court for production of a document which is part of the general diary subject to satisfying the basic ingredients of law stated therein. A document which has been obtained bona fide and has bearing on the case of the prosecution and in the opinion of the Public Prosecutor, the same should be disclosed to the accused in the interest of justice and fair investigation and trial should be furnished to the accused. Then that document should be disclosed to the accused giving him chance of fair defence, particularly when non-production or disclosure of such a document would affect administration of criminal justice and the defence of the accused prejudicially. 13. Also, in the aforesaid Judgment, at paragraphs 17, 19 and 20 it is observed as follows: 17. The issue that has emerged before us is, therefore, somewhat larger than what has been projected by the State and what has been dealt with by the High Court. The question arising would no longer be one of compliance or non-compliance with the provisions of Section 207 Cr.P.C. and would travel beyond the confines of the strict language of the provisions of the Cr.P.C. and touch upon the larger doctrine of a free and fair trial that has been painstakingly built up by the courts on a purposive interpretation of Article 21 of the Constitution. It is not the stage of making of the request; the efflux of time that has occurred or the prior conduct of the accused that is material. What is of significance is if in a given situation the accused comes to the court contending that some papers forwarded to the Court by the investigating agency have not been exhibited by the prosecution as the same favours the accused the court must concede a right to in the accused to have an access to the said documents, if so claimed. This, according to us, is the core issue in the case which must be answered affirmatively. In this regard, we would like to be specific in saying that we find it difficult to agree with the view taken by the High Court that the accused must be made to await the conclusion of the trial to test the plea of prejudice that he may have raised. Such a plea must be answered at the earliest and certainly before the conclusion of the trial, even though it may be raised by the accused belately. This is how the scales of justice in our Criminal Jurisprudence have to be balanced. 19. Any debate or discussion with regard to the purport and object of the examination of an accused under Section 313 Cr.P.C. is wholly unnecessary as the law in this regard is fairly well settled by a long line of the decisions of this Court. The examination of an accused under Section 313 Cr.P.C. not only provides the accused an opportunity to explain the incriminating circumstances appearing against him in the prosecution evidence but such examination also permits him to put forward his own version, if he so chooses, with regard to his involvement or otherwise in the crime alleged against him. Viewed from the latter point of view, the examination of an accused under Section 313 Cr.P.C. does have a fair nexus with the defence that he may choose to bring, if the need arises. Any failure on the part of the accused to put forward his version of the case in his examination under Section 313 Cr.P.C. may have the effect of curtailing his rights in the event the accused chooses to take up a specific defence and examine defence witnesses. Besides, the answers given by the accused in his examination, if incorrect or incomplete, may also jeopardise him as such incorrect or incomplete answers may have the effect of strengthening the prosecution case against the accused. In this connection it may be appropriate to refer to two paragraphs of the judgment of this Court in Manu Sao Vs. State of Bihar (2010 (12) SCC 3100) which are extracted below:- 13. As already noticed, the object of recording the statement of the accused under Section 313 of the Code is to put all incriminating evidence against the accused so as to provide him an opportunity to explain such incriminating circumstances appearing against him in the evidence of the prosecution. At the same time, also to permit him to put forward his own version or reasons, if he so chooses, in relation to his involvement or otherwise in the crime. The court has been empowered to examine the accused but only after the prosecution evidence has been concluded. It is a mandatory obligation upon the court and besides ensuring the compliance therewith the court has to keep in mind that the accused gets a fair chance to explain his conduct. The option lies with the accused to maintain silence coupled with simpliciter denial or in the alternative to explain his version and reasons for his alleged involvement in the commission of crime. This is the statement which the accused makes without fear or right of the other party to cross-examine him. However, if the statements made are false, the court is entitled to draw adverse inferences and pass consequential orders, as may be called for, in accordance with law. The primary purpose is to establish a direct dialogue between the court and the accused and to put to the accused every important incriminating piece of evidence and grant him an opportunity to answer and explain. Once such a statement is recorded, the next question that has to be considered by the court is to what extent and consequences such statement can be used during the enquiry and the trial. Over the period of time, the courts have explained this concept and now it has attained, more or less, certainty in the field of criminal jurisprudence. 14. The statement of the accused can be used to test the veracity of the exculpatory nature of the admission, if any, made by the accused. It can be taken into consideration in any enquiry or trial but still it is not strictly evidence in the case. The provisions of Section 313(4) explicitly provides that the answers given by the accused may be taken into consideration in such enquiry or trial and put in evidence against the accused in any other enquiry or trial for any other offence for which such answers may tend to show he has committed. In other words, the use is permissible as per the provisions of the Code but has its own limitations. The courts may rely on a portion of the statement of the accused and find him guilty in consideration of the other evidence against him led by the prosecution, however, such statements made under this section should not be considered in isolation but in conjunction with evidence adduced by the prosecution. 20. If the above is the avowed purport and object of the examination of an accused under Section 313 Cr.P.C., we do not see as to how the appellant (second accused) can be denied an access to the documents in respect of which prayers have been made in the applications dated 29.3.2012 (for certified copies of the unmarked documents) and dated 18.4.2012 (for inspection) before the learned trial Court. While the anxiety to bring the trial to its earliest conclusion has to be shared it is fundamental that in the process none of the well entrenched principles of law that have been laboriously built by illuminating judicial precedents is sacrificed or compromised. In no circumstance, the cause of justice can be made to suffer, though, undoubtedly, it is highly desirable that the finality of any trial is achieved in the quickest possible time. In view of what has been stated above and to balance the need to bring the prosecution in the present case to its earliest conclusion and at the same time to protect and preserve the right of the accused to a fair trial we are of the view that the following directions would take care of the conflicting interests that have surfaced in the present case:- (1) The accused No.2, i.e. the appellant herein, be allowed an inspection of the unmarked and unexhibited documents referred to by her in the application dated 29.3.2012, i.e., IA No. 711 of 2012 in CC No.2008/2004 filed in the Court of XXXVI Additional City Civil & Sessions Judge, Bangalore; (2) Such inspection will be completed within a period of 21 days from the date of receipt of this order by the learned trial court. The venue of such inspection and also the persons who will be permitted to be present at the time of inspection will be decided by the learned trial court. (3) The right of inspection conferred by this order will not affect the validity of any part of the trial till date, including, the examination of the accused No.1 under Section 313 Cr.P.C. which has since been completed or any part of such examination of the second accused that may have been completed in the meantime. (4) In the event the third and the fourth accused also desire inspection of the unmarked and unexhibited documents such inspection will be allowed by the learned trial court. In such an event the process of inspection will also be simultaneously carried out and completed within the period of 21 days stipulated in the present order. 14. Conversely, the Learned Counsel for the Respondent/Complainant contends that the original complaints relating to the F.I.Rs. in the case are at present not available in the original records of the case and also that the original F.I.Rs in the case were already marked as Exhibits P.1289 to P.1297 without any objection from the side of the Petitioners. 15. The Learned Counsel for the Respondent/Complainant projects his argument that the main case is about 27 years old and in this case, the arguments on the side of the Prosecution were completed and written arguments were also submitted on 10.1.2013. Furthermore, on 28.1.2013, the argument on the side of A.20 was completed and on 29.1.2013, the argument on the side of A.14 was completed. Added further, on 30.1.2013, the arguments on the side of A.5, A.15 and A.18 were completed. In fact, on 1.2.2013, the argument of A.22 was completed and 4.2.2013, the argument of A.13 and A.19 were completed. 16. It is not in dispute that the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8 filed Crl.M.P.No.1680 of 2014 in C.C.No.22 of 1997 on the file of the trial Court under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which speaks of Summons to produce document or other thing. 17. It cannot be gainsaid that the powers conferred under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code are enabling in character and aimed at arming the Court of any Officer-in-charge of the Police Station to enforce and to ensure the production of any document or other things, necessary or desirable, for the purpose of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code, by issuing a summon or a written order to those in possession of such material. 18. The jurisdiction under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code when invoked by the Accused, the desirability and necessity of the same will have to be looked into by a Court of Law mainly in the context of the purpose, i.e., 1. investigation, 2. inquiry, 3. trial or other proceedings under the Code. 19. In fact, the ingredients of Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code clearly enjoin that it concerns with documents forming the subject of a criminal offence, as also with the documents, which can be pressed into service in evidence to assist or support prosecution. 20. It is true that the Court of Law is bound to consider whether there is a prima facie case for summoning whether these documents are relevant and whether they do have a bearing in a given case. If the Court thinks they are, then, it can order production. Also that a Court may also consider whether the documents etc., are being suppressed or may be tampered with or destroyed by a litigant in whose possession it is or may be entirely lost. 21. Whether certain documents ought to be summoned or not is essentially in the discretion of trial Court. Indeed, except for very good reasons, the High Court should not interfere with that discretion as per the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in (AIR 1970 SC 962) ASSISTANT CUSTOMS COLLECTOR, BOMBAY Vs. L.R.MALWANI. 22. Where the documents have no relevance to the case on hand, nor it is desirable for the Court to summon, the Court is quite competent enough to negative the relief sought for in the petition, as opined by this Court. 23. As far as the present case is concerned that even though the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8 filed the Crl.M.P.No.1680 of 2014 in C.C.No.22 of 1997 under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the very fact that they are not available in the 'Court Records' and also in view of the fact that the Respondent/Complainant has averred in the counter before this Court in Crl.O.P.No.18997 of 2014 to the effect that, the then Public Prosecutor had also filed a memo before the trial Court that it was difficult to trace the original complaints and the same was part of Court records, this Court is of the considered view that the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8 can take advantage of the said fact before the trial Court at the time of the arguments of the main case in C.C.No.22 of 1997 and to seek the appropriate remedy in the manner known to law and in accordance with law, if they so desire/advised. That apart, since the said original nine F.I.Rs. are not available and also that the F.I.Rs. were marked as Exhibits P.1289 to P.1297 before the trial Court on behalf of the Respondent/Complainant, then this Court is of the considered view the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8 can take advantage of the same and to seek appropriate remedy thereto. 24. Although it would have been desirable on the part of the Respondent/Complainant to mark the original complaints, yet in view of the established fact as on date the said nine complainants are not available, then this Court is of the considered view that no useful purpose would be served in allowing the Crl.M.P.No.1680 of 2014 filed by the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8. Per contra, the same would result in an otiose one. Viewed in that perspective, the Criminal Original Petition fails. 25. Insofar as the direction issued by the trial Court in Crl.M.P.No.1680 of 2014 in C.C.No.22 of 1997 through its order dated 24.6.2014 that the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8 should deposit a sum of Rs.5,000/- each to the Tamil Nadu Legal Services Authority, Chennai as an exemplary cost, this Court, taking note of overall conspectus and attendant facts and circumstances of the present case in an encircling fashion, comes to an irresistible conclusion that the ends of justice would be met, if this Court orders the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8 each of them to pay Rs.2,500/- to the Tamil Nadu Legal Services Authority, Chennai, within two weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order and accordingly, directs them to pay a sum of Rs.2,500/- each to the Tamil Nadu Legal Services Authority, Chennai, within fourteen days from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. 26. It is made clear that the dismissal of the present Criminal Original Petition by this Court will not preclude the Petitioners/A.7 and A.8 to raise all the factual and legal pleas before the trial Court at the time of the arguments of the main case in C.C.No.22 of 1997 (including non marking of the original complaints) and to seek appropriate remedy in accordance with law, if they so desire/advised. 27. In the result, the criminal original petition is dismissed. Connected M.P.No.1 of 2014 is closed. Best of Luck .. stay blessed."

If there was a DV judgment (under Section 12 with various sub-sections) in May 2019 that directed maintenance for your minor daughter, she might be seeking enforcement of this maintenance order through Section 128 CrPC. Section 31 of the DV Act allows a Magistrate to grant interim and ex parte orders, and it's possible that due to the time elapsed since the judgment in May 2019, she might not be able to file under this section anymore. The reason for choosing Section 128 CrPC could be related to enforcement and execution of the existing DV judgment. Filing Section 128 CrPC Connected to DV Case: Whether she can file a petition under Section 128 CrPC connected to the DV case would depend on the laws and rules? You might be able to challenge the filing based on reasons such as delay, but whether the petition is maintainable would depend on precedents . How to Proceed: If you have evidence to support your claim that the allegations in the DV case were false, it's important to present this evidence to the court. Transfer of Visitation Rights Case and Challenge to Section 128 CrPC: Transferring the visitation rights case and challenging the Section 128 CrPC petition could be options, but the viability of these options would depend on the specific circumstances. Yes, you have strong grounds to believe that the police complaint and CSR could support your case."

Thirdly the buyer has done a fraud so in worst case if it is attached by the bank and order attain finality then you can claim damages from the seller and can register a criminal case of fraud against him Since they are process of auction you have not challanged possession notice of bank under section 13 and physical possession under 14 sarfesi act before DRT file a writ petition before high court seek relief.

At the end when the issues became uncontrollable my husband acted onesided and started asking for proofs for all thing happening around (its all a well planned game from my MIL for which I couldnt show him proofs),Since I didnt have any issues with my Huband, I managed to be patient and controlled myself as far as possible.       Now its that we have Kid, my MIL is creating problems between me and my husband using my Kid, . At one point of time we had an argument and my husband who came at the middle, didnt even ask as to what happened and he said his mother has the first rights and I dont have any rights including on my kid... Which really collapsed me and I took my kid and left home because of her      Since I am working, Now i am staying in a separate house in the same city for last four months.. I initiated so many talks with my husband, I can understand he regrets for whatever he has done, however he is been insticated so much , what he says is he is not ready to have two different house... he wants his Mom and wife under one roof, even if the life is not peaceful.      I asked him to stay with his mom, but to take care of us, after all he is a father. But in Last four months he has not even inquired abt his Kid...      I am very much stressed. I will have to be a slave to my MIL if I go back. I personally didnt have any issues with my husband and our marriage was also not easy, we faced so many battles to get married...

The Certified Standing Orders framed under the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946 as introduced in Air India Ltd. and as applicable to the establishment, required the employer to define the terms and the conditions of applicable to a workman and inform him of the same. The Certified Standing Order, deals with the condition under which an employee can tender his resignation. He is entitled to receive the certificate of service rendered at the time of cessation of his employment. The Certified Standing Order confers a right on the employer, under the Act of 1946, not to accept the resignation if at the relevant time of his resignation any disciplinary action is pending or is contemplated. The Court has pointed out that it is apparent from a bare reading of the provisions contained in Standing Order 18 of the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946 that workman has a right to resign from the services by giving a notice of the period as prescribed under Standing Order 17 which provides termination of services by serving 30 days notice upon a permanent workman and seven days notice with respect to workman who is on probation and temporary workman by serving a 24 hours notice. Thus, for a permanent employee, a period of 30 days is provided to terminate or resign as is apparent on a conjoint reading of provisions of Standing Orders 17 and 18. In the Court\u2019s opinion, from a bare reading of the provisions contained in Standing Order 18, it is crystal clear that a permanent employee has a right to resign from the services by giving a notice of the period of 30 days as prescribed under Standing Order 17, and is entitled to obtain certificate from the employer for the period services have been rendered. Clause 2 of Standing Order 18 provides that in case resignation is submitted with immediate effect or at any time before expiry of notice period, acceptance is necessary. Acceptance of resignation is not required in case a notice has been given of 30 days. It would operative from and effective on the lapse of the period. It is right of a workman to serve an employer and to resign also by serving notice of 30 days. The bond to serve was only for five years as stipulated in his order of appointment. The period of bond to serve was admittedly over. There is no other Standing Order or Rule which puts a fetter on an employee to resign or confers power on the employer to reject a resignation. No disciplinary proceedings was pending or contemplated against an employee in the case, when he resigned. The resignation became effective after lapse of 30 days period. There was no power with the employer as per Standing Order 18 to reject such a resignation. Moreover, the bond period of five years service was already over. A case of voluntary retirement stands on a different footing than that of resignation. Voluntary retirement is with certain civil consequences of monetary benefits. It would depend upon the phraseology used in a particular provision whether prayer made for the resignation or for voluntary retirement is required to be accepted or it takes effect without acceptance. In the facts of the case, in the Standing Order 18, there is no provision for acceptance of resignation, notice is served for requisite period of 30 days, obviously, the appellant had the right to resign from the services. In view of enunciation of law and on consideration of the provisions contained in the Standing Order 18, in the facts and circumstances of the case, the Court has been of the opinion that appellant has rightly terminated the relationship by serving the requisite notice for resignation. The Court has held that in this case, there is no such requirement of acceptance by such an employee under the provisions of the Standing Order 18 read with 17. Thus, the decision in the case \u2013 Moti Ram v. Param Dev and Another \u2013 (1993) 2 SCC 725 paragraphs 16 and 18 ,heavily relied upon by the Respondent\u2019s counsel , is not applicable ,as factual matrix in that case is different from this case. The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal and quashed the HC\u2019s judgment and order and the order passed by the respondent- employer declining to accept the resignation. The benefits which may be available shall be paid to the appellant. Provident Fund with the prevailing rate of interest from time to time. The gratuity, if payable or any other benefit, shall be paid with interest at 6 pc per annum. Outstanding amount, if any, has been ordered to be paid within three months from the date of the judgment."

The Specific Relief (Amendment) Act, 2018 (\"Amendment Act\") has brought about significant amendments to the Specific Relief Act, 1963 (\"Act\"), the critical one being that specific performance is now (unless a case falls within the exceptions) the norm instead of a discretionary power with indian courts.   Under specific relief act sec 14 it is specifically mentioned that CONTRACTS, WHICH CANNOT BE SPECIFICALLY ENFORCED [14. Contracts not specifically enforceable.\u2014The following contracts cannot be specifically enforced, namely:\u2014 (a) where a party to the contract has obtained substituted performance of contract in accordance with the provisions of section 20; (b) a contract, the performance of which involves the performance of a continuous duty which the court cannot supervise;(c) a contract which is so dependent on the personal qualifications of the parties that the court cannot enforce specific performance of its material terms; and (d) a contract which is in its nature determinable.   So the duties which is so dependent on the personal qualifications of the parties that the court cannot enforce specific performance of its material terms, or the performance of which involves the performance of a continuous duty which the court cannot supervise can not specifically enforced. most organization have a condition of \u201dlieu of\u201d. Typically the notice period can be waived \u201din lieu of\u201d pay deduction. And most employees exercise that option by negotiating the difference with the other organization. There are always exceptions but no ethical organization can force an employee to serve the notice unless there is a pressing business need or \u201dnotice pay\u201d refusal from the employee or monetary advances provided to the employee. So you need not to worry as legally you can not be force to serve if you are ready for the pay deduction, and for more clarification we need to see the appointment letter.   Hope this will help plz rate.."

In the meanwhile search for their personal addresses from the office of Registrar of Companies and search for their individual properties and file civil suit to attach the property before judgment under following provision of law.  ========================================================================================= Order 38, Rule 5 CPC:- (1) Where, at any stage of a suit, the Court is satisfied, by affidavit or otherwise, that the defendant, with intent to obstruct or delay the execution of any decree that may be passed against him,- \u2013 (a) is about to dispose of the whole or any part of his property, or \u2013 (b) is about to remove the whole or any part of his property from the local limits of the jurisdiction of the Court, \u2013 the Court may direct the defendant, within a time to be fixed by it, either to furnish security, in such sum as may be specified in the order, to produce and place at the disposal of the Court, when required, the said property or the value of the same, or such portion thereof as may be sufficient to satisfy the decree, or to appear and show cause why he should not furnish security. \u2013 (2) The plaintiff shall, unless the court otherwise directs, specify the property required to be attached and the estimated value thereof. \u2013 (3) The Court may also in the order direct the conditional attachment of the whole or any portion of the property so specified. \u2013 (4) If an order of attachment is made without complying with the provisions of sub-rule (1) of this rule such attachment shall be void. Where defendant may be called upon to furnish security for production of property Scope of rule:- The Scheme of Order 38 and the use of the words `to obstruct or delay the execution of any decree that may be passed against him\u2019 in Rule 5 make it clear that before exercising the power under the said Rule, the court should be satisfied that there is a reasonable chance of a decree being passed in the suit against the defendant. This would mean that the court should be satisfied the plaintiff has a prima facie case. If the averments in the plaint and the documents produced in support of it, do not satisfy the court about the existence of a prima facie case, the court will not go to the next stage of examining whether the interest of the plaintiff should be protected by exercising power under Order 38 Rule 5CPC. . (See the Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in the CASE NO.: Appeal (civil) 6171 of 2001, Raman Tech. & Process Engg. Co. & Anr. Vs.Solanki Traders, DATE OF JUDGMENT: 20/11/2007; 2008 (2) SCC 302). The Hon\u2019ble Apex Court held in the case of Raman Tech. & Process Engg. Co. & Anr the power under Order 38 Rule 5 CPC is drastic and extraordinary power. Such power should not be exercised mechanically or merely for the asking. Application of Order 38, Rule 5 CPC:- Where the property is the property in suit, an injunction should be obtained :- Where the property is the property in suit, an injunction should be obtained under O.XXXIX r.1, Clause (a), which may be enforced under r.2 of that Order by imprisonment or attachment, And where the property is not that in suit, an alternative is given under r.1 of the same Order, Clause (b), where the words \u2018Property\u2019 is not confined to property within the jurisdiction, or property which is in dispute in the suit. [ Raja Goculdas Vs. Jankibai, 5 Bom. L.R. 570, at p.574 (1903), where it is pointed out that Joy narain Geeree Vs. Shibpershad,6 W.R. Misc. 1 (1866) is not applicable as Sec. 93 of the Code of 1859 was expressly limited to the property in dispute.]. No attachment on light grounds:- In 1866, in the case of Gamble Vs Bholgir [2 BHCR 146,161], it was observed that the jurisdiction to attach before judgment should be exercised with great discretion, and no court should grant such an attachment on light grounds or unless it is perfectly satisfied with trustworthy evidence that the defendant is about to dispose of his property or to remove it from the jurisdiction of the Court. Where the most perfect good faith is wanting, the application should be rejected:- In all applications for attachment before judgment, there must be uberrina fides on the part of plaintiff, and where the most perfect good faith is wanting the application should be rejected. Ref. Ahmed Ali Vs. Gladstone Wyllie, 7 W.R 508 (1867). Any stage of the suit :- The application can be made at any stage of the suit, but can be entertained only so long as the suit is pending. See Sri Rammanik Vs.Tin Cowri Rai, B.L.R 68 FB (1869). Intention to obstruct or delay the execution of any decree which might be passed:- The facts mentioned in clauses (a) and (b) must have been done with the intent mentioned in the first paragraph, namely, to obstruct or delay the execution of any decree which might be passed. Ref: Ram Narain Vs. Levy, 2 Hyde, 183 (1864). The words, \u2018 about to dispose of \u2019:- Clause (a) says, is \u2018 about to dispose of \u2019,etc., therefore the section does not apply where the defendant has actually parted with the properties. Ref: Soorjee Kumar Vs. Issur Chunder, Bourke, 243 (1865). It does not refer exclusively to movable properties:- The Section does not refer exclusively to movable properties but applies to immoveable properties also. Ref: Bishambar Vs. Sukhdesi, 16 A 186 (1894). Attachment of property covers its profits:- As has been held in Ram Coomar Vs. Gobindnath, 12 W.R. 391 (1869), attachment of property covers its profits. But if the owner is allowed to enjoy them the profits cease to be specifically liable. In Govindrao Mahadik v. Devi Sahai, , the Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court held at para 58 of its judgment as follows: \u201cAttachment before judgment is levied where the Court on an application of the plaintiff is satisfied that the defendant, with intent to obstruct or delay the execution of any decree that may be passed against him (a) is about to dispose of the whole or any part of his property, or (b) is about to remove the whole or any part of his property from the local limits of the jurisdiction of the Court. The sole object behind the order levying attachment before judgment is to give an assurance to the plaintiff that his decree if made would be satisfied. It is a sort of a guarantee against decree becoming infructuous for want of property available from which the plaintiff can satisfy the decree.\u201d \u2013 In the case of Mamidala Suresh Babu And Ors. vs Tirumalasetti Krishnamurthy and \u2026 2006 (3) ALD 605, 2006 (3) ALT 250, the Hon\u2019ble High Court of Andhra Pradesh, it was held that the sine qua non for an order of attachment before judgment or for an order demanding security before judgment is that the defendant is disposing of or about to dispose of his property with the dishonest intention of defeating or delaying the possible decree in the suit. The merits of the claims of the contending parties are merely ancillary factors for consideration by the Court in arriving at a conclusion with regard to the essential requirements of Order 38, Rule 5, C.P.C. [Also See. Nowroji Pudumjee v. Deccan Bank Ltd., A. I. R. (8) 1921 Bom. 69]. Property without the jurisdiction:- It was held under the last Code both that the section did not and did apply where the property sought to be attached was beyond the jurisdiction of the Court in which the suit was pending. A Court which cannot attach primarily in execution of its decree cannot attach in anticipation of it. It was therefore held, even under the Code of 1859, that a Court of Small Causes could not attach immoveable property under this section. It was held that the Court had jurisdiction where the property was a chose in action due from the Collector who, like the judgment-debtor, resided within the jurisdiction of the attaching court. See. Ravji Moreshwar Vs. Narayan Ballal, 3 Bom. L.R. 462 (1901). Effect of attachment:- If we go through the ruling of the Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court in the case of Sardar Govindrao Mahadik & Anr vs Devi Sahai & Ors, 1982 AIR 989, 1982 SCR (2) 186, we can find answer to this question. What is the effect of attachment before judgment ? Attachment before judgment is levied where the court on an application of the plaintiff is satisfied that the defendant, with intent to obstruct or delay the execution of any decree that may be passed against him (a) is about to dispose of the whole or any part of his property. Or (b) is about to remove the whole or any part of his property from the local limits of the jurisdiction of the Court. The sole object behind the order levying attachment before judgment is to give an assurance to the plaintiff that his decree if made would be satisfied. It is a sort of a guarantee against decree becoming infructuous for want of property available from which the plaintiff can satisfy the decree. The provision in section 64 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that where an attachment has been made, any private transfer or delivery of the property attached or of any interest therein and any payment to the judgment debtor of any debt, dividend or other monies contrary to. such attachment, shall be void as against all claims enforceable under the attachment. What is claimed enforceable is the claim for which the decree is made. Motilal\u2019s suit was for a money claim. It finally ended in a decree for Rs. 500 by High Court and in between the 1st appellate court had dismissed Motilal\u2019s suit in entirety. There is nothing to show that the attachment which would come to an end on the suit being dismissed would get revived if a second appeal is filed which ultimately succeeds. In fact, a dismissal of the suit may terminate the attachment and the same would not be revived even if the suit is restored and this becomes manifestly clear from the newly added provision in sub rule (2) of rule 11 A of order XXXIII, C.P.C. which provides that attachment before judgment in a suit which is dismissed for default shall not be revived merely because by reason of the fact that the order for the dismissal of the suit for default has been set aside and the suit has been restored. As a corollary it would appear that if attachment before judgment is obtained in a suit which ends in a decree but if in appeal the decree is set aside the attachment of necessity must fail. There should be no difficulty in reaching this conclusion. (See 1982 AIR 989; 1982 SCR (2) 186; 1982 SCC (1) 237; and 1982 SCALE (1)191; and S. Noordeen vs S. Thiru Venkita Reddiar & Ors: 1996 AIR 1293, 1996 SCC (3) 289 for more knowledge as this aspect.) \u2013 To know the effect of Order XXXVIII Rules 5, and 7 of the Code of Civil Procedure; and section 136 of the Code of Civil Procedure, it is better to go through the following rulings: Rajender Singh vs Ramdhar Singh And Ors (2001) (CASE NO.: Appeal (civil) 4394 of 1991), Bansropan Singh and Others v.

Shah Talchand Parswachand & Co., AIR (1963) Mys. 147, Vannarakkal Kallalathil Sreedharan v. Chandramaath Balakrishnan and another, [1990] 3 SCC 291 and the Hon\u2019ble Apex Court approved the views expressed in Paparaju Veeraraghavayya v. Killaru Kamala Devi.

        "query-text": "Dear Learned Lawyers.      I am a person with no background in law and regarding one of my personal case, regarding the right of my mother in her father\u2019s property, I would like your valuable suggestions on some issues   .   TOPIC 1   Firstly, as far as my knowledge about succession goes, it is as under:-   1. That THE HINDU SUCCESSION ACT 1956 defines two kinds of properties with different rules of succession:   )      Coparcener Property (Section 6)   When a male Hindu dies after the commencement of this Act, having at the time of his death an interest in a Mitakshara coparcenary property, his interest in the property shall devolve by survivorship upon the surviving members of the coparcenary and not in accordance with this Act.   A Hindu Mitakshara Coparcenary is a body narrower than a Hindu joint family and consists only of males of up to 4 generations who acquire an interest in the Coparcenary property or the joint family property by birth with a unity of possession. The person having interest in the coparcenary property is known as a coparcener.       Coparcenary property consists of the ancestral property and not the separate property of a coparcener. Ancestral property is the property inherited by a Hindu from his father, father\u2019s father or father\u2019s, father\u2019s father whereas the property inherited from any other relation or the self-acquired property of the person is his separate property.       b)         The property of a Male Hindu dying intestate (a property acquired by \u201chim\u201d) (Section 8)   In this the daughters and sons come in Class I heirs.   So as far as the daughters\u2019 right is concerned, it has already been there since the Act of 1956, but in Self-Acquired Property of her Father dying intestate.   2. In 2005 an Amendment Act came into force (Act 39 of 2005).   An amendment was made in Section 6 which defines the daughter as also the co-parcener, but to avail this right the father must have been alive on 9th September 2005. (as interpreted by Honourable Supreme Court recently)   So, the AMENDMENT OF 2005 deals with the co-parcenar properties and not at all with the Self-Acquired Property. The daughters\u2019 right in self Acquired Properties of father has already been in the Act of 1956 and is not related with Section 6 (Amended). So as far as the right of a daughter is concerned in the SELF-ACQUIRED PROPERTY of father dying intestate, the date of death of father is insignificant, as this succession is not governed by Section 6.       Question 1   If I am wrong/incorrect anywhere please update accordingly!      TOPIC 2       Rights in Self-acquired Agricultural Lands   Here I see lots of controversial opinions. There are legal advisors saying that a daugfhter have no right in the agricultural land as it is governed by the state law and not by Hindu Succession Act. However, there are another group which advocates for the same order of succession.   Here I would like to refer Tukaram Genba Jadhav And Others vs Laxman Genba Jadhav And Another on 4 March, 1994 of Bombay High Court with the final decision:   \u201cAfter going through all the decisions cited at the bar with the assistance of learned counsel for the appellant and the learned counsel who appeared as Amicus Curiae to assist the Court, I have reached the conclusion that there is no real conflict between the various decisions of the High Courts in the country. It may be stated in the passing that our Court has decided hundreds and thousands of matters during all these years on the footing that the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 is applicable to agricultural lands save and except to the extent provided in Section 4(2) of the Act. I am happy to conclude that after due scrutiny of all the relevant case-law on the subject, the conclusion of the Court is the same. In my opinion, there is no merit in the appeal. The appeal fails.\u201d   (The detailed judgement can be read at http://indiankanoon.org/doc/292295/)   Section 4(2) of Hindu Succession Act provides the over-riding clauses of this Act.   For the removal of doubts it is hereby declared that nothing contained in this Act shall be deemed to affect the provisions of any law for the time being in force providing for the prevention of fragmentation of agricultural holdings or for the fixation of ceilings or for the devolution of tenancy rights in respect of such holdings.       Question 2   Can you please elaborate the terms and conditions evolving:   PREVENTION OF FRAGMENTATION OF AGRICULTURAL HOLDINGS   FIXATION OF CEILINGS   DEVOLUTION OF TENANCY RIGHTS IN RESPECT OF SUCH HOLDINGS   Question 3   If the sons want to sell the agricultural land for the purpose of commercial/residential construction so how Section 4(2) of Hindu Succession Act is applicable there?      Question 4      Under which conditions, the succession to an agricultural land is governed by Hindu Succession Act 1956 and not by State Tenancy Laws (as in light of the above referred Bombay High Court Order)?       Question 5   As in the amendment of 2005, Section 4(2) has been omitted bringing agricultural land at par with other properties, so what if the daughter claims her share after 2005, but the death of father was in 1986.

If no male descendant is there, the rights of the deceased would come to be inherited even by his brothers or other male relatives but not by his own daughter. In categorical terms, the Act has preferred the brother of a deceased to a married daughter of the deceased for inheritance in tenure holding. Thus, even in a nuclear family where there is no male survivor, the married daughter cannot inherit the rights, rather her uncle has been found by our legislature in its wisdom, to be a suitable heir to inherit the tenure holding."

Director Of Consolidation, Amroha And 6 Others  Counsel for Petitioner :- Archna, Gyan Shankar Ojha, Manoj Srivastava  Counsel for Respondent :-C.S.C.,Mithilesh Kumar Mishra, Nitya Prakash Tiwari, A.S.G.I.  Hon'ble Ram Surat Ram (Maurya),J.  1.\tHeard Sri Gyan Shankar Ojha, for the petitioner and Sri Ganga Prasad Yadav, Additional Chief Standing Counsel, for respondents-1 to 3 and Sri Nitya Prakash Tiwari, for respondent-7 and Sri Ashok Mehta, Senior Advocate, Additional Solicitor General of India, assisted by Sri Harish Kumar Yadav, Standing Counsel for Union of India, for respondent-8.  2.\tThe writ petition has been filed against the orders of Consolidation Officer dated 01.04.2013, Settlement Officer Consolation dated 14.03.2014 and Deputy Director of Consolidation dated 09.06.2014, passed in title proceeding under U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) and for direction to the consolidation authorities to effect the partition of the share of the petitioner in the land in dispute as well as declaring the sale deed dated 14.11.2005, executed by Uttam Singh (respondent-4) in favour of Veer Singh (respondent-7), as void.  3.\tThe dispute relates to basic consolidation year khatas 51, 100, 132, 175 and 300 of village Tarauli and khata 192 of village Nawabpura, pargana Hasanpur, district Amroha. These khatas consisted plots 2 (area 0.413 hectare), 24 (area 0.312 hectare), 73 (area 0.304 hectare), 77 (area 0.372 hectare), 82 (area 0.304 hectare), 130 (area 0.146 hectare), 168 (area 1.181 hectare), 212 (area 0.125 hectare), 217 (area 0.032 hectare), 229 (area 0.024 hectare), 319 (area 1.206 hectare), 334 (area 0.263 hectare), 421 (area 1.157 hectare) and 425 (area 1.154 hectare) (total 14 plots area 6.993 hectare). In basic consolidation records, name of Veer Singh (respondent-7) was recorded over the land in dispute, along with other co-sharers. The petitioner did not dispute shares of other co-sharers, during consolidation operation.  4.\tArchna (the petitioner) filed an objection under Section 9 (2) of the Act, on 08.12.2008, for deleting the name of Veer Singh from the land in dispute and recording her name along with Uttam Singh, Bhanu Pratap Singh and Shashi Bhushan Singh (respondents-4 to 6), claiming herself to be a co-parcener of 1/4 share in the land in dispute. The petitioner stated that the land in dispute was ancestral property, coming from the time of her grand father, Hardeo Singh. After the death of Hardeo Singh, it was inherited by his sons, Khajan Singh and Uttam Singh and their sons, who formed Joint Hindu Family governed by Mitakshara Hindu Law, of which Uttam Singh was 'Karta', who acted as such up to 1989. Hindu Succession Act, 1956 was amended by Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, w.e.f. 20.12.2004. By virtue of Section 6 of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (as amended), the petitioner has become co-parcener along with her father and brothers (respondents-4 to 6). Under the law, Joint Hindu Family Property is a trust for the benefits of the members, living and to be born. However, Khajan Singh and Uttam Singh executed sale deeds dated 14.11.2005 in favour of Veer Singh and on its basis name of Veer Singh was mutated in the revenue record by order dated 19.12.2005. Uttam Singh had no right to execute the sale deed dated 14.11.2005 and it is void. Name of Veer Singh was recorded over the land in dispute on the basis of a void sale deed as such it was liable to be deleted. The case was contested by Veer Singh, who has stated that Khajan Singh and Uttam Singh were \"bhumidhar with transferable right\" of land in dispute, who executed sale deeds dated 14.11.2005 in favour of Veer Singh and others and on its basis names of Veer Singh and others were mutated in the revenue record by order dated 19.12.2005. The land in dispute was agricultural land and the provisions of Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 (hereinafter referred to as U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951) are applicable over it. The provisions of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 are not applicable to it. During life time of Uttam Singh, the petitioner has no right in the land in dispute and her objection was not maintainable.  5.\tThe Consolidation Officer heard the preliminary objection, raised by respondent-7, regarding maintainability of the objection of the petitioner, who after hearing the parties, by order dated 01.04.2013 held that the provisions of Civil Procedure Code, 1908 were not applicable to the proceeding under the Act. Except the land for which declaration under Section 143 of U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951 has been made, provisions of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 will not apply to the agricultural land. Uttam Singh, father of the petitioner was still alive as such no question of inheritance of his bhumidhari holding arose. Otherwise also, the petitioner, being a married daughter was not an heir under Section 171 of U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951, as Uttam Singh was having two sons. The objection of the petitioner was not maintainable. On these findings, objection of the petitioner was dismissed and land in dispute was divided amongst the recorded tenure holders. The petitioner filed an appeal (registered as Appeal No. 20/312) from the aforesaid order. Settlement Officer Consolidation, by order dated 14.03.2014 affirmed the findings of Consolidation Officer and dismissed the appeal. The petitioner filed a revision (registered as Revision No. 544) against the aforesaid orders. Deputy Director of Consolidation, by order dated 09.06.2014 dismissed the revision. Hence this writ petition has been filed.  6.\tThe counsel for the petitioner submitted that the land in dispute was ancestral property, coming from the time of her grand father Hardeo Singh. After death of Hardeo Singh, it was inherited by his sons Khajan Singh and Uttam Singh, who along with their sons, formed a Joint Hindu Family governed by Mitakshara Hindu Law. Uttam Singh acted as 'Karta' of Joint Hindu Family up to 1989. Hindu Succession Act, 1956 was amended by Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, w.e.f. 20.12.2004. By virtue of Section 6 of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (as amended), the petitioner has become a co-parcener along with her father and brothers (respondents-4 to 6), before execution of the sale deed dated 14.11.2005. By Amending Act, 2005, Section 4 (2) was deleted and Section 6 (1) (c) created same liability on the daughter as of the son w.e.f. 20.12.2004, as such, the provisions of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 will apply to agricultural land also. \"Succession\" is a subject falling in Entry-5 of List-III-Concurrent List of Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. Parliament as well as State Legislature both derive their power to make law relating to \"succession\" from Entry -5 of List-III-Concurrent List of Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. Parliament has power to make law under Article 246 (2) in respect of subjects mentioned in List-III-Concurrent List. In case of inconsistency between law made by State Legislature i.e. Section 171 of U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951 and law made by Parliament i.e. Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (as amended), the provisions of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (as amended) will prevail under Article 254. Union of India participated in World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, on 25.06.1993, and made a declaration to eradicate all form of discrimination against women up to the year 2000. In pursuance of above declaration, Law Commission of India made a detailed survey for awarding property right to women and reform under Hindu Law. During survey, it was noticed that 70% of total population of women in the country were actively involved in agricultural work, as against it, involvement of men was found 40% of total population. On the basis of aforesaid survey, Law Commission recommended to delete Section 4 (2) of Hindu Succession Act, 1956, so that the provisions of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 will apply to agricultural land also as actual contribution of the women in cultivation of agricultural land was found more than the men, as such it was thought proper to give equal right of inheritance to women in agricultural land also. In any case, Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 was enacted to fulfill the declaration made before United Nations Organization as well as Article 51 (c) as such it will have overriding effect under Article 253 of the Constitution, which enables the Parliament to make law in respect to subjects of List-II-State List. Section 171 of U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951 makes a gender discrimination between descendants of a tenure holder, in respect of inheritance and is void under Article 13 as it abridges the right of equality of daughter in respect of inheritance in agricultural land and contravenes Articles 14 and 15 of Constitution of India. Under the law, Joint Hindu Family Property is a trust for the benefits of the members, living and to be born. Uttam Singh had no right to execute the sale deed dated 14.11.2005 in favour of Veer Singh of Joint Hindu Family property as such it is void. Name of Veer Singh was recorded over the land in dispute, on the basis of void sale deed dated 14.11.2005, and was liable to be deleted. The petitioner was a co-parcener of the disputed land as such her objection was maintainable under the Act. Orders of consolidation authorities are illegal and liable to be set aside. He also relied upon various case laws, which will be quoted at the relevant place.  7.\tI have considered the arguments of the counsel for the parties and examined the record. Admittedly, the land in dispute was agricultural holdings of the category \"bhumidhar with transferable right\" on 20.12.2004 i.e. date of enforcement of Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, under Section 6 whereof, the petitioner is deriving her right in it. The consolidation authorities have held that provisions of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (as amended in 2005) are not applicable to the agricultural holdings as such the petitioner has no right over the land in dispute during life time of her father and her objection was not maintainable. The question arises as to whether U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951 or Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (as amended in 2005) is to be applied for deciding right of the petitioner? In the light of the arguments of the parties, following questions arise for determination:-  (i)Authority of State Legislature and the Parliament to make law in respect of rights in or over land and land tenure.  (ii)Is there overlapping between subjects mentioned in Entry-18 of List-II-State List and Entry-5 of List-III-Concurrent List ? In case of overlapping, which law will prevail?  (iii)Whether Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 was enacted under Article 253 of the Constitution and has an overriding effect?  Point-I-Authority of State Legislature and the Parliament to make law in respect of right in or over the land and land tenure.  8.\tPart XI, Chapter-I of the Constitution deals with legislative relations -- Distribution of Legislative Powers. By Article 245 the territorial operation of legislative power of the Parliament and the State Legislatures is delimited, and Article 246 distributes legislative power subject-wise between the Parliament and the State Legislatures. Articles 247, 249, 250, 252 and 253 enact some of the exceptions to the rule contained in Article 246. Relevant articles are quoted below:-  246. Subject-matter of laws made by Parliament and by the Legislatures of States.--(1) Notwithstanding anything in clauses (2) and (3), Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred to as the \"Union List\").  (2) Notwithstanding anything in clause (3), Parliament, and, subject to clause (1), the Legislature of any State also, have power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III in the Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred to as the \"Concurrent List\").  (3) Subject to clauses (1) and (2), the Legislature of any State has exclusive power to make laws for such State or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred to as the \"State List\").  (4) Parliament has power to make laws with respect to any matter for any part of the territory of India not included in a State notwithstanding that such matter is a matter enumerated in the State List.  254. Inconsistency between laws made by Parliament and laws made by the Legislatures of States.--  (1) If any provision of a law made by the Legislature of a State is repugnant to any provision of a law made by Parliament which Parliament is competent to enact, or to any provision of an existing law with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List, then, subject to the provisions of clause (2), the law made by Parliament, whether passed before or after the law made by the Legislature of such State, or, as the case may be, the existing law, shall prevail and the law made by the Legislature of the State shall, to the extent of the repugnancy, be void.  (2) Where a law made by the Legislature of a State with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List contains any provision repugnant to the provisions of an earlier law made by Parliament or an existing law with respect to that matter, then, the law so made by the Legislature of such State shall, if it has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent, prevail in that State:  Provided that nothing in this clause shall prevent Parliament from enacting at any time any law with respect to the same matter including a law adding to, amending, varying or repealing the law so made by the Legislature of the State.  9.\tBefore coming into force of Constitution of India, field of legislation of Federal Government and State Government were governed by the provisions of Government of India Act, 1935. Seventh Schedule, List-II-Provincial Legislative List contained subjects for Provincial Legislature and List-III-Concurrent Legislative List contained subjects for both Federal and Provincial Legislature. Relevant entries are quoted below:-  Seventh Schedule- List II -- Provincial Legislative List  21. Land, that is to say, rights in or over land, land tenures, including the relation of landlord and tenant, and the collection of rents; transfer, alienation and devolution of agricultural land; land improvement and agricultural loans; colonization; Court of Wards; encumbered and attached estates; treasure trove.  Seventh Schedule - List III -- Concurrent Legislative List  7. Wills, intestacy and succession, save as regards agricultural land.  10.\tThese entries have been slightly modified in the Constitution. Relevant entries of Constitution of India are quoted below:-  Seventh Schedule -List II -- State List  18. Land, that is to say, rights in or over land, land tenures including the relation of landlord and tenant, and the collection of rents; transfer and alienation of agricultural land; land improvement and agricultural loans; colonization.  Seventh Schedule- List III -- Concurrent List  5. Marriage and divorce; infants and minors; adoption; wills, intestacy and succession; joint family and partition; all matters in respect of which parties in judicial proceedings were immediately before the commencement of this Constitution subject to their personal law.  11.\tEntry-7 of List III --Concurrent Legislative List of Government of India Act, 1935 used phrase \"save as regards agricultural land\", from which, it is clear that rights in or over land, and land tenures was within exclusive domain of State Legislature under Government of India Act, 1935. In Constitution, Entry-5 of List III --Concurrent List, uses phrase \"all matters in respect of which parties in judicial proceedings were immediately before the commencement of this Constitution subject to their personal law\". From which, it has been again clarified that rights in or over land, and land tenures was within exclusive domain of State Legislature under Entry-18 of List-II-State List. Thus State Legislature alone has jurisdiction to make law in respect of rights in or over land, and land tenures, under which U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951 was enacted. The words \"right in\" is a comprehensive phrase and includes right of inheritance and devolution of interest.  12.\tSupreme Court in State of W.B. v. Kesoram Industries Ltd., AIR 2005 SC 1646 has held that the legislative field between Parliament and the legislature of any State is divided by Article 246 of the Constitution. Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule, called the \"Union List\". Subject to the said power of Parliament, the legislature of any State has power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III, called the \"Concurrent List\". Subject to the abovesaid two, the legislature of any State has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II, called the \"State List\". Under Article 248 the exclusive power of Parliament to make laws extends to any matter not enumerated in the Concurrent List or State List. This is, what is called the residuary power, vested in Parliament. The principles summarised, as are relevant for this case, are quoted below:-  (1)The various entries in the three lists are not \"powers\" of legislation but \"fields\" of legislation. The Constitution effects a complete separation of the taxing power of the Union and of the States under Article 246.  (2) In spite of the fields of legislation having been demarcated, the question of repugnancy between law made by Parliament and a law made by the State Legislature may arise only in cases when both the legislation occupy the same field with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List and a direct conflict is seen. If there is a repugnancy due to overlapping found between List II on the one hand and List I and List III on the other, the State law will be ultra vires and shall have to give way to the Union law.  (3) The entries in the lists being merely topics or fields of legislation, they must receive a liberal construction inspired by a broad and generous spirit and not in a narrow pedantic sense. The words and expressions employed in drafting the entries must be given the widest-possible interpretation. The allocation of the subjects to the lists is not by way of scientific or logical definition but by way of a mere simplex enumeratio of broad categories. A power to legislate as to the principal matter specifically mentioned in the entry shall also include within its expanse the legislations touching incidental and ancillary matters.  (4) Where the legislative competence of the legislature of any State is questioned on the ground that it encroaches upon the legislative competence of Parliament to enact a law, the question one has to ask is whether the legislation relates to any of the entries in List I or III. If it does, no further question need be asked and Parliament's legislative competence must be upheld. Where there are three lists containing a large number of entries, there is bound to be some overlapping among them. In such a situation the doctrine of pith and substance has to be applied to determine as to which entry does a given piece of legislation relate. Once it is so determined, any incidental trenching on the field reserved to the other legislature is of no consequence. The court has to look at the substance of the matter. The doctrine of pith and substance is sometimes expressed in terms of ascertaining the true character of legislation. The name given by the legislature to the legislation is immaterial. Regard must be had to the enactment as a whole, to its main objects and to the scope and effect of its provisions. Incidental and superficial encroachments are to be disregarded.  (5) The doctrine of occupied field applies only when there is a clash between the Union and the State Lists within an area common to both. There the doctrine of pith and substance is to be applied and if the impugned legislation substantially falls within the power expressly conferred upon the legislature which enacted it, an incidental encroaching in the field assigned to another legislature is to be ignored. While reading the three lists, List I has priority over Lists III and II and List III has priority over List II. However, still, the predominance of the Union List would not prevent the State Legislature from dealing with any matter within List II though it may incidentally affect any item in List I.  13.\tIn view of the aforesaid principles the words \"right in or over the land and land tenure\" have to be given widest-possible interpretation and include \"right of inheritance\" also. Arguments of the counsel for the petitioner that the word \"succession\", under Entry-5 of List III \u00ad Concurrent List covers subject inheritance of \"rights in or over land and land tenure\" also, is not liable to be accepted. Entry-5 of List III -- Concurrent List, uses phrase \"all matters in respect of which parties in judicial proceedings were immediately before the commencement of this Constitution subject to their personal law\". Thus applicability of personal law of succession is limited in respect of which judicial proceeding were pending immediately before the commencement of this Constitution. There is nothing on record to show that right of the parties over the land in dispute was subject to personal law or any judicial proceeding was pending on 26.01.1950, in respect of it. It covers the matter of Section 14 of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 as held by Punjab and Haryana High Court in Amar Singh Vs. Baldev Singh, AIR, 1960 P&H 686 (F.B.) that Section 14 of Hindu Succession Act, 1956, which enlarged the widow's interest in agricultural land is within the domain of Entry-5 of List III - Concurrent List. Contrary view taken by Orrisa High Court in Laxmi Devi Vs. Surendra Kumar Panda, AIR, 1957 Orrisa 1 (D.B.) and Karnataka High Court in Basavant Gondi Vs. Smt. Channabasawwa, AIR, 1971 Kant. 151 (D.B.) is not liable to be accepted.  14.\tThe object of enactment of U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951 as declared by its long title is to provide for abolition of Zamindari system involving intermediaries between the tiller of the soil and the State, for acquisition of their rights, title and interest and to reform the law relating to land tenure consequent upon such abolition and acquisition. In order to secure the purpose of land reform, various provisions have been made to ensure that soil must go to the actual tiller. Section 9 and Section 123 confer absolute right to the actual occupier of the land of abadi etc. while tenurial right of (i) bhumidhar with transferable right, (ii) bhumidhar with non-transferable right (iii) asami and (iv) government lessee have been conferred under other provisions. The object that soil must go to the actual tiller has been applied in cases of inheritance and devolution of interest also. Under some contingency widow and daughter are given right of inheritance but on their remarriage/ marriage, they are divested under Section 172 of the Act. From the time immemorial, society in our country is patriarchal society, where daughter/ woman has to go to the house of her husband on marriage, where she forms a new family. Law makers were conscious with the situation of marriage of daughter/woman and patriarchal system of the society. It was kept in mind while enacting Section 171 and Section 172 of U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951 that after marriage it would not be practicable for a woman to cultivate land at two places as such after marriage/remarriage, women are divested. U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951 is preserved under Ninth Schedule of the Constitution at Serial No. 11 and is protected under Article 31-A of the Constitution as such its validity cannot be challenged on the ground of Article 13 of the Constitution. Constitutional validity of this Act has been upheld time to time by Constitutional Benches of Supreme Court, in State of U.P. Vs. Raja Brahma Shah, AIR 1967 SC 661 and S.P. Watel Vs. State of U.P., AIR 1973 SC 1293.  15.\tA Full Bench of this Court in Ram Awalamb Vs. Jata Shankar, AIR 1969 All 526 (FB) held that  [vide para 29] In our opinion the contention of the learned counsel cannot be accepted for the following reasons:-  (a) The scheme of the Act seems to be to make one law for persons of all castes and creeds and for that reason there is no mention of Hindu joint family anywhere in the Act except in Chapter III (Assessment and Compensation) where for purposes of calculation of compensation only father and his male lineal descendants are to be treated as one unit while the other members of the family are to be treated as separate units.  (b) The notions of Hindu law, or for that matter any personal law, could not be applied to bhumidhari rights, because:  (i) these are new rights conferred under the Act, and  (ii) the special provisions of the Act relation to status of a bhumidhar, transfer by him of his interests in bhumidhar land, and devolution of his interests after; his death are governed by the provisions of this special Act.  ( c) It can be safely inferred from Section 175 of the Act that where there are more than one bhumidhar in any holding all the co-bhumidhars shall be tenants in common and not joint tenants. That provision of law is applicable to the members of a joint Hindu family having interest in bhumidhari rights. The interest of each person in bhumidhari land passes according to the order of succession given in Sections 171 to 174 of the Act and not by survivorship. The principle of survivorship amongst co-widows and co-bhumidhars can apply only when there is failure of heirs as mentioned in Sections 171 to 174, (see Dulli V.s Imarti Devi, 196G All LJ (Rev).29).  (d) The notions of Hindu law will not apply to bhumidhari land because both the main incidents of a joint family property, to wit(i) devolution by survivorship, and (ii) male issue of a coparcener acquiring an interest by birth (vide Mulla's Hindu Law 13th Ed. Para 221) are negatived by the provisions of the Act.  [vide Para -44] Our conclusions can, therefore, be briefly summarized as follows :-  (1) Where members of a joint Hindu Family hold bhumidhari rights in any holding, they hold the same as tenants in common and not as joint tenants. The notions of Hindu Law cannot be invoked to determine that status.  (2) Where in certain class of tenancies, such as permanent tenure holders, the interest of a tenant was both heritable and transferable in a limited sense and such a tenancy could, prior to the enforcement of the Act, be described as joint family property or coparcenary property, the position changed after Act I of 1951 came into force. Thereafter the interest of each bhumidhar being heritable only according to the order of succession provided in the Act and transferable without any restriction other than mentioned in the Act itself, must be deemed to be a separate unit.  (3) Each member of a joint Hindu family must be considered to be a separate unit for the exercise of the right of transfer and also for the purposes of devolution of bhumidhar interest of the deceased member.  (4) The right of transfer of each member of the joint Hindu family of his interest in bhumidhari land is controlled only by Section 152 of the Act and by no other restriction. The provisions of Hindu law relating to restriction on transfer of coparcenary land, e.g., existence of legal necessity, do not apply.  In Parshanti v. Dy. Director of Consolidation, AIR 1999 SC 1567, it has been held that a Hindu widow, who after the death of her husband remarries another person, cannot lay a claim to the property of her son through the first marriage in agricultural land in the general law under the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 as the provisions of Section 171(b) of the U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951,being a special Act, are applicable.  Point-II-Is there overlapping between subjects mentioned in Entry-18 of List-II-State List and Entry-5 of List-III-Concurrent List ? In case of overlapping, which law will prevail?  16.\tAs held above, subject \"rights in or over land, and land tenures\" is mentioned in Entry-18 of List-II-State List which includes right of inheritance and there is no overlapping of the subjects between Entry-18 of List-II-State List and Entry-5 of List-III-Concurrent List. Under Article 246 (3) of the Constitution, State Legislature alone has jurisdiction to make law in respect of rights in or over land, and land tenures including right of inheritance. Subject \"succession\" mentioned in Entry-5 of List III-Concurrent List has a limited application as provided under Section 14 of Hindu Succession Act, 1956. Even if it is treated that subject \"succession\" is falling under Entry-5 of List-III-Concurrent List, assent of President of India has been obtained in respect of U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951 as such in case of repugnancy also, U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951 will prevail over Hindu Succession Act, 1956 under Article 254 (2) of the Constitution. Supreme Court in Rajiv Sarin v. State of Uttarakhand, AIR 2011 SC 3081 has held that the assent of the President under Article 254(2) of the Constitution is not a matter of idle formality. The President has, at least, to be apprised of the reason why his assent is sought if, there is any special reason for doing so. If the assent is sought and given in general terms so as to be effective for all purposes, different considerations may legitimately arise. But if, as in the instant case, the assent of the President is sought to the law for a specific purpose, the efficacy of the assent would be limited to that purpose and cannot be extended beyond it.\"  Point-III-Whether Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 was enacted in exercise of powers under Article 253 of the Constitution and has an overriding effect?  17.\tThe counsel for the petitioner argued that Union of India participated in World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, on 25.06.1993, and made a declaration to eradicate all form of discrimination against women up to the year 2000. In pursuance of above declaration, Law Commission of India made a detailed survey for awarding property right to women and reform under Hindu Law. During survey, it was noticed that 70% of total population of women in the country are actively doing agricultural work, as against it, involvement of men was found 40% of total population. On the basis of aforesaid survey, Law Commission recommended to delete Section 4 (2) of Hindu Succession Act, 1956, so that the provisions of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 will apply to agricultural land also as actual contribution of the women in cultivation of agricultural land was found more than the men as such it was thought proper to give equal right of inheritance to women for agricultural land also. In any case, Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 was enacted to fulfill the declaration made before United Nations Organization as well as Article 51 (c) as such it will have overriding effect under Article 253 of the Constitution.  18.\tThe effect of Article 253 is that if a treaty, agreement or convention with a foreign State deals with a subject within the competence of the State Legislature, the Parliament alone has, notwithstanding Article 246(3), the power to make laws to implement the treaty, agreement or convention or any decision made at any international conference, association or other body. In terms, the Article deals with legislative power: thereby power is conferred upon the Parliament which it may not otherwise possess. Article 253 of Constitution is quoted below:-  253. Legislation for giving effect to international agreements.-- Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this Chapter, Parliament has power to make any law for the whole or any part of the territory of India for implementing any treaty, agreement or convention with any other country or countries or any decision made at any international conference, association or other body.  19.\tThe question arises as to whether Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 was enacted in exercise of powers under Article 253? In order to appreciate aforesaid arguments, aims and object as given by Parliament for enactment of Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 is quoted below:-  Hindu Succession (Amendment ) Act 2005  [ No. 39 of 2005]  [September 5, 2005]  An Act further to amend the Hindu Succession Act, 1956  Be it enacted by Parliament in the Fifty-sixth Year of the Republic of India as follows:-  Prefatory Note-Statement of Objects and Reasons.- The Hindu Succession Act, 1956 has amended and codified the law relating to intestate succession among Hindus. The Act brought about changes in the law of succession among Hindus and gave rights which were till then unknown in relation to women's property. However, it does not interfere with the special rights of those who are members of Hindus Mitakshara coparcenary except to provide rules for devolution of the interest of a deceased male in certain cases. The Act lays down a uniform and comprehensive system of inheritance and applied, inter alia to persons governed by Aliyasantana and Nambudri laws. The Act applies to every person who is a Hindu by religion in any of its forms or developments including a Virashaiva, a Lingayat or a follower of the Brahmo, Pararthana or Arya Samaj; or to any person who is Buddhist, Jain or Sikh by religion; or to any other person who is not a Muslim, Christian, Parsi or Jew by religion. In the case of a testamentary disposition, this Act does not apply and the interest of the deceased is governed by the Indian Succession Act, 1925.  2.\tSection 6 of the Act deals with devolution of interest of a male Hindu in coparcenary property and recognizes the rule of devolution by survivorship among the members of the coparcenary. The retention of the Mitakshara coparcenary property without including the females in it means that the females cannot inherit in the ancestral property as their male counterparts do. The law by excluding the daughter from participating in the coparcenary ownership not only contributes to her discrimination on the ground of gender but also has led to oppression and negation of her fundamental right of equality guaranteed by the Constitution. Having regard to the need to render social justice to women, the State of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Maharashtra have made necessary changes in the law giving equal right to daughters in Hindu Mitakshara coparcenay property. The Kerala Legislature has enacted the Kerala Joint Hindu Family System ( Abolition) Act . 1975.  3.\tIt is proposed to remove the discrimination as contained in Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 by giving equal rights to daughters in the Hindu Mitakshara coparcenary property as the sons have. Section 23 of the Act disentitles a female heir to ask for partition in respect of a dwelling house wholly occupied by a joint family until the male heirs choose to divide their respective shares therein. It is also proposed to omit the said section so as to remove the disability on female heirs contained in that section.  4.The above proposals are based on the recommendations of the Law Commission of India as contained in its 174th Report on \"Property Rights of Women: Proposed Reform under the Hindu Law\".  5.The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects.  20.\tThus aim and object, as given by Parliament for enactment of Amending Act, 2005, was to remove the discrimination as contained in Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 by giving equal rights to daughters in the Hindu Mitakshara coparcenary property as the sons have. The aim and object as suggested by Law Commission in 174th Report for applying the Act to agricultural land also has not been adopted by Parliament as such it is not possible to hold that Amending Act, 2005 was enacted to apply Hindu Succession Act, 1956 over agricultural land also or it was enacted in pursuance of declaration made before United Nations Organization as well as Article 51 (c). Thus it is clear that Amending Act, 2005 intended to provide the right to Hindu daughters equal with the son in Mitakshara coparcenary property. It does not intend to provide such right to the daughters/women of other religion living in the country. There is nothing in the Act 2005 to prove that it was enacted in pursuance of declaration made before United Nations Organisation. As such Article 253 of the Constitution has no application.  21.\tSupreme Court in Gramophone Co. of India Ltd. v. Birendra Bahadur Pandey, AIR 1984 SC 667, held that there can be no question that nations must march with the international community and the municipal law must respect rules of international law even as nations respect international opinion. The comity of nations requires that rules of international law may be accommodated in the municipal law even without express legislative sanction provided they do not run into conflict with Acts of Parliament. But when they do run into such conflict, the sovereignty and the integrity of the Republic and the supremacy of the constituted legislatures in making the laws may not be subjected to external rules except to the extent legitimately accepted by the constituted legislatures themselves. The doctrine of incorporation also recognises the position that the rules of international law are incorporated into national law and considered to be part of the national law, unless they are in conflict with an Act of Parliament. Comity of nations or no, municipal law must prevail in case of conflict. National courts cannot say yes if Parliament has said no to a principle of international law. National courts will endorse international law but not if it conflicts with national law. National courts being organs of the national State and not organs of international law must perforce apply national law if international law conflicts with it. But the courts are under an obligation within legitimate limits, to so interpret the municipal statute as to avoid confrontation with the comity of nations or the well established principles of international law. But if conflict is inevitable, the latter must yield.  22.\tThe argument of the counsel for the petitioner that by deleting Section 4 (2) of Hindu Succession Act, 1956, the provisions of this Act have become applicable to agricultural land also. Hindu Succession Act, 1956 was enacted to amend and codify the law relating to intestate succession among Hindus. Sections 4 and 6 are quoted below:-  Prior to amendment by Act 39 of 2005, Section 4 read as:-  4. Overriding effect of Act.--Save as otherwise expressly provided in this Act,--  (a) any text, rule or interpretation of Hindu Law or any custom or usage as part of that law in force immediately before the commencement of this Act, shall cease to have effect with respect to any matter for which provision is made in this Act;  (b) any other law in force immediately before the commencement of this Act shall cease to apply to Hindus in so far as it is inconsistent with any of the provisions contained in this Act.  (2) For the removal of doubts it is hereby declared that nothing contained in this Act shall be deemed to affect the provisions of any law for the time being in force providing for the prevention of fragmentation of agricultural holdings or for the fixation of ceilings or for the devolution of tenancy rights in respect of such holdings.  After amendment by Act 39 of 2005, Section 6 read as:-  6. Devolution of interest in coparcenary property.--(1) On and from the commencement of the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, in a Joint Hindu family governed by the Mitakshara law, the daughter of a coparcener shall,--  (a) by birth become a coparcener in her own right in the same manner as the son;  (b) have the same rights in the coparcenary property as she would have had if she had been a son;  (c) be subject to the same liabilities in respect of the said coparcenary property as that of a son,  and any reference to a Hindu Mitakshara coparcener shall be deemed to include a reference to a daughter of a coparcener:  Provided that nothing contained in this sub-section shall affect or invalidate any disposition or alienation including any partition or testamentary disposition of property which had taken place before the 20th day of December, 2004.  (2) Any property to which a female Hindu becomes entitled by virtue of sub-section (1) shall be held by her with the incidents of coparcenary ownership and shall be regarded, notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, or any other law for the time being in force, as property capable of being disposed of her by testamentary disposition.  (3) Where a Hindu dies after the commencement of the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, his interest in the property of a Joint Hindu Family governed by the Mitakshara law, shall devolve by testamentary or intestate succession, as the case may be, under this Act and not by survisorship, and the coparcenary property shall be deemed to have been divided as if a partition had taken place and,--  (a) the daughter is allotted the same share as is allotted to a son;  (b) the share of the pre-deceased son or a pre-deceased daughter, as they would have got had they been alive at the time of partition, shall be allotted to the surviving child of such pre-deceased son or of such pre-deceased daughter; and  (c) the share of the pre-deceased child of a pre-deceased son or of a pre-deceased daughter, as such child would have got had he or she been alive at the time of the partition, shall be allotted to the child of such pre-deceased child of the pre-deceased son or a pre-deceased daughter, as the case may be.  Explanation.--For the purposes of this sub-section, the interest of a Hindu Mitakshara coparcener shall be deemed to be the share in the property that would have been allotted to him if a partition of the property had taken place immediately before his death, irrespective of whether he was entitled to claim partition or not.  (4) After the commencement of the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, no court shall recognise any right to proceed against a son, grandson or great grandson for the recovery of any debt due from his father, grandfather or great grandfather solely on the ground of the pious obligation under the Hindu law, or such son, grandson or great-grandson to discharge any such debt:  Provided that in the case of any debt contracted before the commencement of the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, nothing contained in this sub-section shall effect--  (a) the right of any creditor to proceed against the son, grandson or great-grandson, as the case may be; or  (b) any alienation made in respect of or in satisfaction of, any such debt, and any such right or alienation shall be enforceable under the rule of pious obligation in the same manner and to the same extent as it would have been enforceable as if the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 had not been enacted.  Explanation.--For the purposes of clause (a), the expression \"son\", \"grandson\" or \"great-grandson\" shall be deemed to refer to the son, grandson or great-grandson, as the case may be, who was born or adopted prior to the commencement of the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005.  (5) Nothing contained in this section shall apply to a partition, which has been effected before the 20th day of December, 2004.  Explanation.--For the purposes of this section \"partition\" means any partition made by execution of a deed of partition duly registered under the Registration Act, 1908 (16 of 1908) or partition effected by a decree of a court.  23.\tThus combined reading of the preamble, Section 4 and Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 it is clear that the Act was applied on Joint Hindu Mitakshara property only and not on agricultural land. As held above, agricultural land is in exclusive domain of State Legislature and Parliament has no power to enact any law in this respect. Section 4 (2) was only by way of clarification. On its basis, it cannot be said that after its deletion, Hindu Succession Act, 1956 suo moto applies to agricultural land. Under Section 6, (as amended) daughters are given right under Hindu Mitakshara Coparcenary Property alone.  24.\tThe counsel for the petitioner relied upon the judgment of Supreme Court in Bajaya Vs. Gopikabai, AIR 1978, S.C. 793, in which relying upon Section 151 of M.P. Land Revenue Code, 1954, it has been held that under this Section itself personal law has been applied in the matter of devolution of interest of a deceased tenure holder. Dipo Vs. Wassan Singh, AIR 1983 SC 846, in which it has been held that at the time of inheritance of ancestral property, if a person did not have a son, son's son or son's son's son, it was his absolute property. Madhu Kishwar Vs. State of Bihar, AIR 1996 SC 1864, custom amongst tribal in State of Bihar, governing the land relating to succession was held to have no effect in view of Section 4 of Hindu Succession Act, 1956. In this case, there was no issue relating to overriding effect of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 on land law of the State or legislative competence for enactment of land law. As such the case, is distinguishable. Ms. Savita Samvedi Vs. Union of India, (1996) 2 SCC 380, in which it has been held that married daughter can also be given compassionate appointment. Vishakha Vs. State of Rajsthan, AIR 1997 SC 3011, wherein validity of law relating to prevention of sexual harassment of women at working place has been upheld and has been held that working women have fundamental right under Article 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution. Sheela Devi Vs. Lal Chand, (2006) 8 SCC 581, in which devolution of co-parcenary property after coming into force of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 was dealt with. Ganduri Koteshwaramma Chakiri Yanadi, (2011) 9 SCC 788, in which preliminary decree passed prior to Amending Act, 2005 in the suit for partition of co-parcenary property has been modified according to the Amended Act, 2005. These cases have no application.  25.\tThe counsel for the petitioner also relied upon the judgments of Delhi High Court in Smt. Mukesh and others Vs. Sri Bharat Singh, (2008) 149 DLT 114 and Karnataka High Court in Pushpalatha Vs. S.V. Padma, AIR 2010 Kar 124, in which provision of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (as amended in 2005) has been applied in agricultural land also. For the reasons given above, I respectfully disagree with the view taken in the above cases. The counsel for the petitioner submitted that due to Section 4 (2) of Hindu Succession Act, 1956, this Court in Jata Shankar Vs. Ram Awalamb, AIR 1969, All 526 (F.B.), Uma Shankar Vs. D.D.C. And others, AIR 1979, All 407 (D.B.), Writ Petition No. 4226 of 1967, Mohd. Sohrab Khan Vs. D.D.C. And others decided on 02.12.1969 and Writ Petition No. 6177 of 2009, Ram Kumar Vs. A.D.J. And others decided on 23.8.2012, it has been held that the provisions of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 has no application on agricultural land. Now Section 4 (2) has been deleted. As held above Section 4(2) of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 was nothing to do with the applicability of the Act. As such the argument of the counsel for the petitioner will not be improved.  26.\tIn view of the aforesaid discussions, there is no merit in the writ petition and it is dismissed.

Hon'ble Ram Surat Ram (Maurya),J.  1.\tHeard Sri Gyan Shankar Ojha, for the petitioner and Sri Ganga Prasad Yadav, Additional Chief Standing Counsel, for respondents-1 to 3 and Sri Nitya Prakash Tiwari, for respondent-7 and Sri Ashok Mehta, Senior Advocate, Additional Solicitor General of India, assisted by Sri Harish Kumar Yadav, Standing Counsel for Union of India, for respondent-8.  2.\tThe writ petition has been filed against the orders of Consolidation Officer dated 01.04.2013, Settlement Officer Consolation dated 14.03.2014 and Deputy Director of Consolidation dated 09.06.2014, passed in title proceeding under U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) and for direction to the consolidation authorities to effect the partition of the share of the petitioner in the land in dispute as well as declaring the sale deed dated 14.11.2005, executed by Uttam Singh (respondent-4) in favour of Veer Singh (respondent-7), as void.  3.\tThe dispute relates to basic consolidation year khatas 51, 100, 132, 175 and 300 of village Tarauli and khata 192 of village Nawabpura, pargana Hasanpur, district Amroha. These khatas consisted plots 2 (area 0.413 hectare), 24 (area 0.312 hectare), 73 (area 0.304 hectare), 77 (area 0.372 hectare), 82 (area 0.304 hectare), 130 (area 0.146 hectare), 168 (area 1.181 hectare), 212 (area 0.125 hectare), 217 (area 0.032 hectare), 229 (area 0.024 hectare), 319 (area 1.206 hectare), 334 (area 0.263 hectare), 421 (area 1.157 hectare) and 425 (area 1.154 hectare) (total 14 plots area 6.993 hectare). In basic consolidation records, name of Veer Singh (respondent-7) was recorded over the land in dispute, along with other co-sharers. The petitioner did not dispute shares of other co-sharers, during consolidation operation.  4.\tArchna (the petitioner) filed an objection under Section 9 (2) of the Act, on 08.12.2008, for deleting the name of Veer Singh from the land in dispute and recording her name along with Uttam Singh, Bhanu Pratap Singh and Shashi Bhushan Singh (respondents-4 to 6), claiming herself to be a co-parcener of 1/4 share in the land in dispute. The petitioner stated that the land in dispute was ancestral property, coming from the time of her grand father, Hardeo Singh. After the death of Hardeo Singh, it was inherited by his sons, Khajan Singh and Uttam Singh and their sons, who formed Joint Hindu Family governed by Mitakshara Hindu Law, of which Uttam Singh was 'Karta', who acted as such up to 1989. Hindu Succession Act, 1956 was amended by Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, w.e.f. 20.12.2004. By virtue of Section 6 of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (as amended), the petitioner has become co-parcener along with her father and brothers (respondents-4 to 6). Under the law, Joint Hindu Family Property is a trust for the benefits of the members, living and to be born. However, Khajan Singh and Uttam Singh executed sale deeds dated 14.11.2005 in favour of Veer Singh and on its basis name of Veer Singh was mutated in the revenue record by order dated 19.12.2005. Uttam Singh had no right to execute the sale deed dated 14.11.2005 and it is void. Name of Veer Singh was recorded over the land in dispute on the basis of a void sale deed as such it was liable to be deleted. The case was contested by Veer Singh, who has stated that Khajan Singh and Uttam Singh were \"bhumidhar with transferable right\" of land in dispute, who executed sale deeds dated 14.11.2005 in favour of Veer Singh and others and on its basis names of Veer Singh and others were mutated in the revenue record by order dated 19.12.2005. The land in dispute was agricultural land and the provisions of Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 (hereinafter referred to as U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951) are applicable over it. The provisions of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 are not applicable to it. During life time of Uttam Singh, the petitioner has no right in the land in dispute and her objection was not maintainable.  5.\tThe Consolidation Officer heard the preliminary objection, raised by respondent-7, regarding maintainability of the objection of the petitioner, who after hearing the parties, by order dated 01.04.2013 held that the provisions of Civil Procedure Code, 1908 were not applicable to the proceeding under the Act. Except the land for which declaration under Section 143 of U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951 has been made, provisions of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 will not apply to the agricultural land. Uttam Singh, father of the petitioner was still alive as such no question of inheritance of his bhumidhari holding arose. Otherwise also, the petitioner, being a married daughter was not an heir under Section 171 of U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951, as Uttam Singh was having two sons. The objection of the petitioner was not maintainable. On these findings, objection of the petitioner was dismissed and land in dispute was divided amongst the recorded tenure holders. The petitioner filed an appeal (registered as Appeal No. 20/312) from the aforesaid order. Settlement Officer Consolidation, by order dated 14.03.2014 affirmed the findings of Consolidation Officer and dismissed the appeal. The petitioner filed a revision (registered as Revision No. 544) against the aforesaid orders. Deputy Director of Consolidation, by order dated 09.06.2014 dismissed the revision. Hence this writ petition has been filed.  6.\tThe counsel for the petitioner submitted that the land in dispute was ancestral property, coming from the time of her grand father Hardeo Singh. After death of Hardeo Singh, it was inherited by his sons Khajan Singh and Uttam Singh, who along with their sons, formed a Joint Hindu Family governed by Mitakshara Hindu Law. Uttam Singh acted as 'Karta' of Joint Hindu Family up to 1989. Hindu Succession Act, 1956 was amended by Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, w.e.f. 20.12.2004. By virtue of Section 6 of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (as amended), the petitioner has become a co-parcener along with her father and brothers (respondents-4 to 6), before execution of the sale deed dated 14.11.2005. By Amending Act, 2005, Section 4 (2) was deleted and Section 6 (1) (c) created same liability on the daughter as of the son w.e.f. 20.12.2004, as such, the provisions of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 will apply to agricultural land also. \"Succession\" is a subject falling in Entry-5 of List-III-Concurrent List of Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. Parliament as well as State Legislature both derive their power to make law relating to \"succession\" from Entry -5 of List-III-Concurrent List of Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. Parliament has power to make law under Article 246 (2) in respect of subjects mentioned in List-III-Concurrent List. In case of inconsistency between law made by State Legislature i.e. Section 171 of U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951 and law made by Parliament i.e. Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (as amended), the provisions of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (as amended) will prevail under Article 254. Union of India participated in World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, on 25.06.1993, and made a declaration to eradicate all form of discrimination against women up to the year 2000. In pursuance of above declaration, Law Commission of India made a detailed survey for awarding property right to women and reform under Hindu Law. During survey, it was noticed that 70% of total population of women in the country were actively involved in agricultural work, as against it, involvement of men was found 40% of total population. On the basis of aforesaid survey, Law Commission recommended to delete Section 4 (2) of Hindu Succession Act, 1956, so that the provisions of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 will apply to agricultural land also as actual contribution of the women in cultivation of agricultural land was found more than the men, as such it was thought proper to give equal right of inheritance to women in agricultural land also. In any case, Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 was enacted to fulfill the declaration made before United Nations Organization as well as Article 51 (c) as such it will have overriding effect under Article 253 of the Constitution, which enables the Parliament to make law in respect to subjects of List-II-State List. Section 171 of U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951 makes a gender discrimination between descendants of a tenure holder, in respect of inheritance and is void under Article 13 as it abridges the right of equality of daughter in respect of inheritance in agricultural land and contravenes Articles 14 and 15 of Constitution of India. Under the law, Joint Hindu Family Property is a trust for the benefits of the members, living and to be born. Uttam Singh had no right to execute the sale deed dated 14.11.2005 in favour of Veer Singh of Joint Hindu Family property as such it is void. Name of Veer Singh was recorded over the land in dispute, on the basis of void sale deed dated 14.11.2005, and was liable to be deleted. The petitioner was a co-parcener of the disputed land as such her objection was maintainable under the Act. Orders of consolidation authorities are illegal and liable to be set aside. He also relied upon various case laws, which will be quoted at the relevant place.  7.\tI have considered the arguments of the counsel for the parties and examined the record. Admittedly, the land in dispute was agricultural holdings of the category \"bhumidhar with transferable right\" on 20.12.2004 i.e. date of enforcement of Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, under Section 6 whereof, the petitioner is deriving her right in it. The consolidation authorities have held that provisions of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (as amended in 2005) are not applicable to the agricultural holdings as such the petitioner has no right over the land in dispute during life time of her father and her objection was not maintainable. The question arises as to whether U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951 or Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (as amended in 2005) is to be applied for deciding right of the petitioner? In the light of the arguments of the parties, following questions arise for determination:-  (i)Authority of State Legislature and the Parliament to make law in respect of rights in or over land and land tenure.  (ii)Is there overlapping between subjects mentioned in Entry-18 of List-II-State List and Entry-5 of List-III-Concurrent List ? In case of overlapping, which law will prevail?  (iii)Whether Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 was enacted under Article 253 of the Constitution and has an overriding effect?  Point-I-Authority of State Legislature and the Parliament to make law in respect of right in or over the land and land tenure.  8.\tPart XI, Chapter-I of the Constitution deals with legislative relations -- Distribution of Legislative Powers. By Article 245 the territorial operation of legislative power of the Parliament and the State Legislatures is delimited, and Article 246 distributes legislative power subject-wise between the Parliament and the State Legislatures. Articles 247, 249, 250, 252 and 253 enact some of the exceptions to the rule contained in Article 246. Relevant articles are quoted below:-  246. Subject-matter of laws made by Parliament and by the Legislatures of States.--(1) Notwithstanding anything in clauses (2) and (3), Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred to as the \"Union List\").  (2) Notwithstanding anything in clause (3), Parliament, and, subject to clause (1), the Legislature of any State also, have power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III in the Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred to as the \"Concurrent List\").  (3) Subject to clauses (1) and (2), the Legislature of any State has exclusive power to make laws for such State or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred to as the \"State List\").  (4) Parliament has power to make laws with respect to any matter for any part of the territory of India not included in a State notwithstanding that such matter is a matter enumerated in the State List.  254. Inconsistency between laws made by Parliament and laws made by the Legislatures of States.--  (1) If any provision of a law made by the Legislature of a State is repugnant to any provision of a law made by Parliament which Parliament is competent to enact, or to any provision of an existing law with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List, then, subject to the provisions of clause (2), the law made by Parliament, whether passed before or after the law made by the Legislature of such State, or, as the case may be, the existing law, shall prevail and the law made by the Legislature of the State shall, to the extent of the repugnancy, be void.  (2) Where a law made by the Legislature of a State with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List contains any provision repugnant to the provisions of an earlier law made by Parliament or an existing law with respect to that matter, then, the law so made by the Legislature of such State shall, if it has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent, prevail in that State:  Provided that nothing in this clause shall prevent Parliament from enacting at any time any law with respect to the same matter including a law adding to, amending, varying or repealing the law so made by the Legislature of the State.  9.\tBefore coming into force of Constitution of India, field of legislation of Federal Government and State Government were governed by the provisions of Government of India Act, 1935. Seventh Schedule, List-II-Provincial Legislative List contained subjects for Provincial Legislature and List-III-Concurrent Legislative List contained subjects for both Federal and Provincial Legislature. Relevant entries are quoted below:-  Seventh Schedule- List II -- Provincial Legislative List  21. Land, that is to say, rights in or over land, land tenures, including the relation of landlord and tenant, and the collection of rents; transfer, alienation and devolution of agricultural land; land improvement and agricultural loans; colonization; Court of Wards; encumbered and attached estates; treasure trove.  Seventh Schedule - List III -- Concurrent Legislative List  7. Wills, intestacy and succession, save as regards agricultural land.  10.\tThese entries have been slightly modified in the Constitution. Relevant entries of Constitution of India are quoted below:-  Seventh Schedule -List II -- State List  18. Land, that is to say, rights in or over land, land tenures including the relation of landlord and tenant, and the collection of rents; transfer and alienation of agricultural land; land improvement and agricultural loans; colonization.  Seventh Schedule- List III -- Concurrent List  5. Marriage and divorce; infants and minors; adoption; wills, intestacy and succession; joint family and partition; all matters in respect of which parties in judicial proceedings were immediately before the commencement of this Constitution subject to their personal law.  11.\tEntry-7 of List III --Concurrent Legislative List of Government of India Act, 1935 used phrase \"save as regards agricultural land\", from which, it is clear that rights in or over land, and land tenures was within exclusive domain of State Legislature under Government of India Act, 1935. In Constitution, Entry-5 of List III --Concurrent List, uses phrase \"all matters in respect of which parties in judicial proceedings were immediately before the commencement of this Constitution subject to their personal law\". From which, it has been again clarified that rights in or over land, and land tenures was within exclusive domain of State Legislature under Entry-18 of List-II-State List. Thus State Legislature alone has jurisdiction to make law in respect of rights in or over land, and land tenures, under which U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951 was enacted. The words \"right in\" is a comprehensive phrase and includes right of inheritance and devolution of interest.  12.\tSupreme Court in State of W.B. v. Kesoram Industries Ltd., AIR 2005 SC 1646 has held that the legislative field between Parliament and the legislature of any State is divided by Article 246 of the Constitution. Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule, called the \"Union List\". Subject to the said power of Parliament, the legislature of any State has power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III, called the \"Concurrent List\". Subject to the abovesaid two, the legislature of any State has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II, called the \"State List\". Under Article 248 the exclusive power of Parliament to make laws extends to any matter not enumerated in the Concurrent List or State List. This is, what is called the residuary power, vested in Parliament. The principles summarised, as are relevant for this case, are quoted below:-  (1)The various entries in the three lists are not \"powers\" of legislation but \"fields\" of legislation. The Constitution effects a complete separation of the taxing power of the Union and of the States under Article 246.  (2) In spite of the fields of legislation having been demarcated, the question of repugnancy between law made by Parliament and a law made by the State Legislature may arise only in cases when both the legislation occupy the same field with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List and a direct conflict is seen. If there is a repugnancy due to overlapping found between List II on the one hand and List I and List III on the other, the State law will be ultra vires and shall have to give way to the Union law.  (3) The entries in the lists being merely topics or fields of legislation, they must receive a liberal construction inspired by a broad and generous spirit and not in a narrow pedantic sense. The words and expressions employed in drafting the entries must be given the widest-possible interpretation. The allocation of the subjects to the lists is not by way of scientific or logical definition but by way of a mere simplex enumeratio of broad categories. A power to legislate as to the principal matter specifically mentioned in the entry shall also include within its expanse the legislations touching incidental and ancillary matters.  (4) Where the legislative competence of the legislature of any State is questioned on the ground that it encroaches upon the legislative competence of Parliament to enact a law, the question one has to ask is whether the legislation relates to any of the entries in List I or III. If it does, no further question need be asked and Parliament's legislative competence must be upheld. Where there are three lists containing a large number of entries, there is bound to be some overlapping among them. In such a situation the doctrine of pith and substance has to be applied to determine as to which entry does a given piece of legislation relate. Once it is so determined, any incidental trenching on the field reserved to the other legislature is of no consequence. The court has to look at the substance of the matter. The doctrine of pith and substance is sometimes expressed in terms of ascertaining the true character of legislation. The name given by the legislature to the legislation is immaterial. Regard must be had to the enactment as a whole, to its main objects and to the scope and effect of its provisions. Incidental and superficial encroachments are to be disregarded.  (5) The doctrine of occupied field applies only when there is a clash between the Union and the State Lists within an area common to both. There the doctrine of pith and substance is to be applied and if the impugned legislation substantially falls within the power expressly conferred upon the legislature which enacted it, an incidental encroaching in the field assigned to another legislature is to be ignored. While reading the three lists, List I has priority over Lists III and II and List III has priority over List II. However, still, the predominance of the Union List would not prevent the State Legislature from dealing with any matter within List II though it may incidentally affect any item in List I.  13.\tIn view of the aforesaid principles the words \"right in or over the land and land tenure\" have to be given widest-possible interpretation and include \"right of inheritance\" also. Arguments of the counsel for the petitioner that the word \"succession\", under Entry-5 of List III \u00ad Concurrent List covers subject inheritance of \"rights in or over land and land tenure\" also, is not liable to be accepted. Entry-5 of List III -- Concurrent List, uses phrase \"all matters in respect of which parties in judicial proceedings were immediately before the commencement of this Constitution subject to their personal law\". Thus applicability of personal law of succession is limited in respect of which judicial proceeding were pending immediately before the commencement of this Constitution. There is nothing on record to show that right of the parties over the land in dispute was subject to personal law or any judicial proceeding was pending on 26.01.1950, in respect of it. It covers the matter of Section 14 of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 as held by Punjab and Haryana High Court in Amar Singh Vs. Baldev Singh, AIR, 1960 P&H 686 (F.B.) that Section 14 of Hindu Succession Act, 1956, which enlarged the widow's interest in agricultural land is within the domain of Entry-5 of List III - Concurrent List. Contrary view taken by Orrisa High Court in Laxmi Devi Vs. Surendra Kumar Panda, AIR, 1957 Orrisa 1 (D.B.) and Karnataka High Court in Basavant Gondi Vs. Smt. Channabasawwa, AIR, 1971 Kant. 151 (D.B.) is not liable to be accepted.  14.\tThe object of enactment of U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951 as declared by its long title is to provide for abolition of Zamindari system involving intermediaries between the tiller of the soil and the State, for acquisition of their rights, title and interest and to reform the law relating to land tenure consequent upon such abolition and acquisition. In order to secure the purpose of land reform, various provisions have been made to ensure that soil must go to the actual tiller. Section 9 and Section 123 confer absolute right to the actual occupier of the land of abadi etc. while tenurial right of (i) bhumidhar with transferable right, (ii) bhumidhar with non-transferable right (iii) asami and (iv) government lessee have been conferred under other provisions. The object that soil must go to the actual tiller has been applied in cases of inheritance and devolution of interest also. Under some contingency widow and daughter are given right of inheritance but on their remarriage/ marriage, they are divested under Section 172 of the Act. From the time immemorial, society in our country is patriarchal society, where daughter/ woman has to go to the house of her husband on marriage, where she forms a new family. Law makers were conscious with the situation of marriage of daughter/woman and patriarchal system of the society. It was kept in mind while enacting Section 171 and Section 172 of U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951 that after marriage it would not be practicable for a woman to cultivate land at two places as such after marriage/remarriage, women are divested. U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951 is preserved under Ninth Schedule of the Constitution at Serial No. 11 and is protected under Article 31-A of the Constitution as such its validity cannot be challenged on the ground of Article 13 of the Constitution. Constitutional validity of this Act has been upheld time to time by Constitutional Benches of Supreme Court, in State of U.P. Vs. Raja Brahma Shah, AIR 1967 SC 661 and S.P. Watel Vs. State of U.P., AIR 1973 SC 1293.  15.\tA Full Bench of this Court in Ram Awalamb Vs. Jata Shankar, AIR 1969 All 526 (FB) held that  [vide para 29] In our opinion the contention of the learned counsel cannot be accepted for the following reasons:-  (a) The scheme of the Act seems to be to make one law for persons of all castes and creeds and for that reason there is no mention of Hindu joint family anywhere in the Act except in Chapter III (Assessment and Compensation) where for purposes of calculation of compensation only father and his male lineal descendants are to be treated as one unit while the other members of the family are to be treated as separate units.  (b) The notions of Hindu law, or for that matter any personal law, could not be applied to bhumidhari rights, because:  (i) these are new rights conferred under the Act, and  (ii) the special provisions of the Act relation to status of a bhumidhar, transfer by him of his interests in bhumidhar land, and devolution of his interests after; his death are governed by the provisions of this special Act.  ( c) It can be safely inferred from Section 175 of the Act that where there are more than one bhumidhar in any holding all the co-bhumidhars shall be tenants in common and not joint tenants. That provision of law is applicable to the members of a joint Hindu family having interest in bhumidhari rights. The interest of each person in bhumidhari land passes according to the order of succession given in Sections 171 to 174 of the Act and not by survivorship. The principle of survivorship amongst co-widows and co-bhumidhars can apply only when there is failure of heirs as mentioned in Sections 171 to 174, (see Dulli V.s Imarti Devi, 196G All LJ (Rev).29).  (d) The notions of Hindu law will not apply to bhumidhari land because both the main incidents of a joint family property, to wit(i) devolution by survivorship, and (ii) male issue of a coparcener acquiring an interest by birth (vide Mulla's Hindu Law 13th Ed. Para 221) are negatived by the provisions of the Act.  [vide Para -44] Our conclusions can, therefore, be briefly summarized as follows :-  (1) Where members of a joint Hindu Family hold bhumidhari rights in any holding, they hold the same as tenants in common and not as joint tenants. The notions of Hindu Law cannot be invoked to determine that status.  (2) Where in certain class of tenancies, such as permanent tenure holders, the interest of a tenant was both heritable and transferable in a limited sense and such a tenancy could, prior to the enforcement of the Act, be described as joint family property or coparcenary property, the position changed after Act I of 1951 came into force. Thereafter the interest of each bhumidhar being heritable only according to the order of succession provided in the Act and transferable without any restriction other than mentioned in the Act itself, must be deemed to be a separate unit.  (3) Each member of a joint Hindu family must be considered to be a separate unit for the exercise of the right of transfer and also for the purposes of devolution of bhumidhar interest of the deceased member.  (4) The right of transfer of each member of the joint Hindu family of his interest in bhumidhari land is controlled only by Section 152 of the Act and by no other restriction. The provisions of Hindu law relating to restriction on transfer of coparcenary land, e.g., existence of legal necessity, do not apply.  In Parshanti v. Dy. Director of Consolidation, AIR 1999 SC 1567, it has been held that a Hindu widow, who after the death of her husband remarries another person, cannot lay a claim to the property of her son through the first marriage in agricultural land in the general law under the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 as the provisions of Section 171(b) of the U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951,being a special Act, are applicable.  Point-II-Is there overlapping between subjects mentioned in Entry-18 of List-II-State List and Entry-5 of List-III-Concurrent List ? In case of overlapping, which law will prevail?  16.\tAs held above, subject \"rights in or over land, and land tenures\" is mentioned in Entry-18 of List-II-State List which includes right of inheritance and there is no overlapping of the subjects between Entry-18 of List-II-State List and Entry-5 of List-III-Concurrent List. Under Article 246 (3) of the Constitution, State Legislature alone has jurisdiction to make law in respect of rights in or over land, and land tenures including right of inheritance. Subject \"succession\" mentioned in Entry-5 of List III-Concurrent List has a limited application as provided under Section 14 of Hindu Succession Act, 1956. Even if it is treated that subject \"succession\" is falling under Entry-5 of List-III-Concurrent List, assent of President of India has been obtained in respect of U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951 as such in case of repugnancy also, U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951 will prevail over Hindu Succession Act, 1956 under Article 254 (2) of the Constitution. Supreme Court in Rajiv Sarin v. State of Uttarakhand, AIR 2011 SC 3081 has held that the assent of the President under Article 254(2) of the Constitution is not a matter of idle formality. The President has, at least, to be apprised of the reason why his assent is sought if, there is any special reason for doing so. If the assent is sought and given in general terms so as to be effective for all purposes, different considerations may legitimately arise. But if, as in the instant case, the assent of the President is sought to the law for a specific purpose, the efficacy of the assent would be limited to that purpose and cannot be extended beyond it.\"  Point-III-Whether Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 was enacted in exercise of powers under Article 253 of the Constitution and has an overriding effect?  17.\tThe counsel for the petitioner argued that Union of India participated in World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, on 25.06.1993, and made a declaration to eradicate all form of discrimination against women up to the year 2000. In pursuance of above declaration, Law Commission of India made a detailed survey for awarding property right to women and reform under Hindu Law. During survey, it was noticed that 70% of total population of women in the country are actively doing agricultural work, as against it, involvement of men was found 40% of total population. On the basis of aforesaid survey, Law Commission recommended to delete Section 4 (2) of Hindu Succession Act, 1956, so that the provisions of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 will apply to agricultural land also as actual contribution of the women in cultivation of agricultural land was found more than the men as such it was thought proper to give equal right of inheritance to women for agricultural land also. In any case, Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 was enacted to fulfill the declaration made before United Nations Organization as well as Article 51 (c) as such it will have overriding effect under Article 253 of the Constitution.  18.\tThe effect of Article 253 is that if a treaty, agreement or convention with a foreign State deals with a subject within the competence of the State Legislature, the Parliament alone has, notwithstanding Article 246(3), the power to make laws to implement the treaty, agreement or convention or any decision made at any international conference, association or other body. In terms, the Article deals with legislative power: thereby power is conferred upon the Parliament which it may not otherwise possess. Article 253 of Constitution is quoted below:-  253. Legislation for giving effect to international agreements.-- Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this Chapter, Parliament has power to make any law for the whole or any part of the territory of India for implementing any treaty, agreement or convention with any other country or countries or any decision made at any international conference, association or other body.  19.\tThe question arises as to whether Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 was enacted in exercise of powers under Article 253? In order to appreciate aforesaid arguments, aims and object as given by Parliament for enactment of Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 is quoted below:-  Hindu Succession (Amendment ) Act 2005  [ No. 39 of 2005]  [September 5, 2005]  An Act further to amend the Hindu Succession Act, 1956  Be it enacted by Parliament in the Fifty-sixth Year of the Republic of India as follows:-  Prefatory Note-Statement of Objects and Reasons.- The Hindu Succession Act, 1956 has amended and codified the law relating to intestate succession among Hindus. The Act brought about changes in the law of succession among Hindus and gave rights which were till then unknown in relation to women's property. However, it does not interfere with the special rights of those who are members of Hindus Mitakshara coparcenary except to provide rules for devolution of the interest of a deceased male in certain cases. The Act lays down a uniform and comprehensive system of inheritance and applied, inter alia to persons governed by Aliyasantana and Nambudri laws. The Act applies to every person who is a Hindu by religion in any of its forms or developments including a Virashaiva, a Lingayat or a follower of the Brahmo, Pararthana or Arya Samaj; or to any person who is Buddhist, Jain or Sikh by religion; or to any other person who is not a Muslim, Christian, Parsi or Jew by religion. In the case of a testamentary disposition, this Act does not apply and the interest of the deceased is governed by the Indian Succession Act, 1925.  2.\tSection 6 of the Act deals with devolution of interest of a male Hindu in coparcenary property and recognizes the rule of devolution by survivorship among the members of the coparcenary. The retention of the Mitakshara coparcenary property without including the females in it means that the females cannot inherit in the ancestral property as their male counterparts do. The law by excluding the daughter from participating in the coparcenary ownership not only contributes to her discrimination on the ground of gender but also has led to oppression and negation of her fundamental right of equality guaranteed by the Constitution. Having regard to the need to render social justice to women, the State of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Maharashtra have made necessary changes in the law giving equal right to daughters in Hindu Mitakshara coparcenay property. The Kerala Legislature has enacted the Kerala Joint Hindu Family System ( Abolition) Act . 1975.  3.\tIt is proposed to remove the discrimination as contained in Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 by giving equal rights to daughters in the Hindu Mitakshara coparcenary property as the sons have. Section 23 of the Act disentitles a female heir to ask for partition in respect of a dwelling house wholly occupied by a joint family until the male heirs choose to divide their respective shares therein. It is also proposed to omit the said section so as to remove the disability on female heirs contained in that section.  4.The above proposals are based on the recommendations of the Law Commission of India as contained in its 174th Report on \"Property Rights of Women: Proposed Reform under the Hindu Law\".  5.The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects.  20.\tThus aim and object, as given by Parliament for enactment of Amending Act, 2005, was to remove the discrimination as contained in Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 by giving equal rights to daughters in the Hindu Mitakshara coparcenary property as the sons have. The aim and object as suggested by Law Commission in 174th Report for applying the Act to agricultural land also has not been adopted by Parliament as such it is not possible to hold that Amending Act, 2005 was enacted to apply Hindu Succession Act, 1956 over agricultural land also or it was enacted in pursuance of declaration made before United Nations Organization as well as Article 51 (c). Thus it is clear that Amending Act, 2005 intended to provide the right to Hindu daughters equal with the son in Mitakshara coparcenary property. It does not intend to provide such right to the daughters/women of other religion living in the country. There is nothing in the Act 2005 to prove that it was enacted in pursuance of declaration made before United Nations Organisation. As such Article 253 of the Constitution has no application.  21.\tSupreme Court in Gramophone Co. of India Ltd. v. Birendra Bahadur Pandey, AIR 1984 SC 667, held that there can be no question that nations must march with the international community and the municipal law must respect rules of international law even as nations respect international opinion. The comity of nations requires that rules of international law may be accommodated in the municipal law even without express legislative sanction provided they do not run into conflict with Acts of Parliament. But when they do run into such conflict, the sovereignty and the integrity of the Republic and the supremacy of the constituted legislatures in making the laws may not be subjected to external rules except to the extent legitimately accepted by the constituted legislatures themselves. The doctrine of incorporation also recognises the position that the rules of international law are incorporated into national law and considered to be part of the national law, unless they are in conflict with an Act of Parliament. Comity of nations or no, municipal law must prevail in case of conflict. National courts cannot say yes if Parliament has said no to a principle of international law. National courts will endorse international law but not if it conflicts with national law. National courts being organs of the national State and not organs of international law must perforce apply national law if international law conflicts with it. But the courts are under an obligation within legitimate limits, to so interpret the municipal statute as to avoid confrontation with the comity of nations or the well established principles of international law. But if conflict is inevitable, the latter must yield.  22.\tThe argument of the counsel for the petitioner that by deleting Section 4 (2) of Hindu Succession Act, 1956, the provisions of this Act have become applicable to agricultural land also. Hindu Succession Act, 1956 was enacted to amend and codify the law relating to intestate succession among Hindus. Sections 4 and 6 are quoted below:-  Prior to amendment by Act 39 of 2005, Section 4 read as:-  4. Overriding effect of Act.--Save as otherwise expressly provided in this Act,--  (a) any text, rule or interpretation of Hindu Law or any custom or usage as part of that law in force immediately before the commencement of this Act, shall cease to have effect with respect to any matter for which provision is made in this Act;  (b) any other law in force immediately before the commencement of this Act shall cease to apply to Hindus in so far as it is inconsistent with any of the provisions contained in this Act.  (2) For the removal of doubts it is hereby declared that nothing contained in this Act shall be deemed to affect the provisions of any law for the time being in force providing for the prevention of fragmentation of agricultural holdings or for the fixation of ceilings or for the devolution of tenancy rights in respect of such holdings.  After amendment by Act 39 of 2005, Section 6 read as:-  6. Devolution of interest in coparcenary property.--(1) On and from the commencement of the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, in a Joint Hindu family governed by the Mitakshara law, the daughter of a coparcener shall,-- (a) by birth become a coparcener in her own right in the same manner as the son;  (b) have the same rights in the coparcenary property as she would have had if she had been a son;  (c) be subject to the same liabilities in respect of the said coparcenary property as that of a son,  and any reference to a Hindu Mitakshara coparcener shall be deemed to include a reference to a daughter of a coparcener:  Provided that nothing contained in this sub-section shall affect or invalidate any disposition or alienation including any partition or testamentary disposition of property which had taken place before the 20th day of December, 2004.  (2) Any property to which a female Hindu becomes entitled by virtue of sub-section (1) shall be held by her with the incidents of coparcenary ownership and shall be regarded, notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, or any other law for the time being in force, as property capable of being disposed of her by testamentary disposition.  (3) Where a Hindu dies after the commencement of the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, his interest in the property of a Joint Hindu Family governed by the Mitakshara law, shall devolve by testamentary or intestate succession, as the case may be, under this Act and not by survisorship, and the coparcenary property shall be deemed to have been divided as if a partition had taken place and,--  (a) the daughter is allotted the same share as is allotted to a son;  (b) the share of the pre-deceased son or a pre-deceased daughter, as they would have got had they been alive at the time of partition, shall be allotted to the surviving child of such pre-deceased son or of such pre-deceased daughter; and  (c) the share of the pre-deceased child of a pre-deceased son or of a pre-deceased daughter, as such child would have got had he or she been alive at the time of the partition, shall be allotted to the child of such pre-deceased child of the pre-deceased son or a pre-deceased daughter, as the case may be.  Explanation.--For the purposes of this sub-section, the interest of a Hindu Mitakshara coparcener shall be deemed to be the share in the property that would have been allotted to him if a partition of the property had taken place immediately before his death, irrespective of whether he was entitled to claim partition or not.  (4) After the commencement of the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, no court shall recognise any right to proceed against a son, grandson or great grandson for the recovery of any debt due from his father, grandfather or great grandfather solely on the ground of the pious obligation under the Hindu law, or such son, grandson or great-grandson to discharge any such debt:  Provided that in the case of any debt contracted before the commencement of the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, nothing contained in this sub-section shall effect--  (a) the right of any creditor to proceed against the son, grandson or great-grandson, as the case may be; or  (b) any alienation made in respect of or in satisfaction of, any such debt, and any such right or alienation shall be enforceable under the rule of pious obligation in the same manner and to the same extent as it would have been enforceable as if the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 had not been enacted.  Explanation.--For the purposes of clause (a), the expression \"son\", \"grandson\" or \"great-grandson\" shall be deemed to refer to the son, grandson or great-grandson, as the case may be, who was born or adopted prior to the commencement of the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005.  (5) Nothing contained in this section shall apply to a partition, which has been effected before the 20th day of December, 2004.  Explanation.--For the purposes of this section \"partition\" means any partition made by execution of a deed of partition duly registered under the Registration Act, 1908 (16 of 1908) or partition effected by a decree of a court.  23.\tThus combined reading of the preamble, Section 4 and Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 it is clear that the Act was applied on Joint Hindu Mitakshara property only and not on agricultural land. As held above, agricultural land is in exclusive domain of State Legislature and Parliament has no power to enact any law in this respect. Section 4 (2) was only by way of clarification. On its basis, it cannot be said that after its deletion, Hindu Succession Act, 1956 suo moto applies to agricultural land. Under Section 6, (as amended) daughters are given right under Hindu Mitakshara Coparcenary Property alone.  24.\tThe counsel for the petitioner relied upon the judgment of Supreme Court in Bajaya Vs. Gopikabai, AIR 1978, S.C. 793, in which relying upon Section 151 of M.P. Land Revenue Code, 1954, it has been held that under this Section itself personal law has been applied in the matter of devolution of interest of a deceased tenure holder. Dipo Vs. Wassan Singh, AIR 1983 SC 846, in which it has been held that at the time of inheritance of ancestral property, if a person did not have a son, son's son or son's son's son, it was his absolute property. Madhu Kishwar Vs. State of Bihar, AIR 1996 SC 1864, custom amongst tribal in State of Bihar, governing the land relating to succession was held to have no effect in view of Section 4 of Hindu Succession Act, 1956. In this case, there was no issue relating to overriding effect of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 on land law of the State or legislative competence for enactment of land law. As such the case, is distinguishable. Ms. Savita Samvedi Vs. Union of India, (1996) 2 SCC 380, in which it has been held that married daughter can also be given compassionate appointment. Vishakha Vs. State of Rajsthan, AIR 1997 SC 3011, wherein validity of law relating to prevention of sexual harassment of women at working place has been upheld and has been held that working women have fundamental right under Article 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution. Sheela Devi Vs. Lal Chand, (2006) 8 SCC 581, in which devolution of co-parcenary property after coming into force of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 was dealt with. Ganduri Koteshwaramma Chakiri Yanadi, (2011) 9 SCC 788, in which preliminary decree passed prior to Amending Act, 2005 in the suit for partition of co-parcenary property has been modified according to the Amended Act, 2005. These cases have no application.  25.\tThe counsel for the petitioner also relied upon the judgments of Delhi High Court in Smt. Mukesh and others Vs. Sri Bharat Singh, (2008) 149 DLT 114 and Karnataka High Court in Pushpalatha Vs. S.V. Padma, AIR 2010 Kar 124, in which provision of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (as amended in 2005) has been applied in agricultural land also. For the reasons given above, I respectfully disagree with the view taken in the above cases. The counsel for the petitioner submitted that due to Section 4 (2) of Hindu Succession Act, 1956, this Court in Jata Shankar Vs. Ram Awalamb, AIR 1969, All 526 (F.B.), Uma Shankar Vs. D.D.C. And others, AIR 1979, All 407 (D.B.), Writ Petition No. 4226 of 1967, Mohd. Sohrab Khan Vs. D.D.C. And others decided on 02.12.1969 and Writ Petition No. 6177 of 2009, Ram Kumar Vs. A.D.J. And others decided on 23.8.2012, it has been held that the provisions of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 has no application on agricultural land. Now Section 4 (2) has been deleted. As held above Section 4(2) of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 was nothing to do with the applicability of the Act. As such the argument of the counsel for the petitioner will not be improved.  26.\tIn view of the aforesaid discussions, there is no merit in the writ petition and it is dismissed.  Order Date :- 27.3.2015"

On 10-Sep-23, a gentleman claiming to be her husband met me and insisted that I should get married to the mentioned lady. Soon after, I filed a compliant on National Crime reporting portal and on 14-Sep-23 to the Deputy Commissioner of Police - East Sonipat. On the night 23-Sep-23, I received multiple phone calls from associates of the mentioned lady - some were from international dialing codes. I disconnected every call, and filed another complaint on National Crime reporting portal. First week of Oct- 23, I received a note from Murthal Police Station in hindi which said MUKADAMA NUMBER 327 dated 03-Oct-23 under section 342, 354 A and 506 IPC and notice under section 41 A IPC. This is on the basis of the complaint made against me by the mentioned lady. 13-Oct-23, I submitted my plea of innocence to the Commissioner of Police \u2013 Sonipat and Deputy commissioner of Police \u2013 East, Sonipat. The Commissioner of Police Sonipat opined to cancel the MUKADAMA. I submitted my please of innocence to Assistant Commissioner of Police \u2013 Murthal Police station on 18-Oct-23. On 3-Nov-23, at Murthal Police station I was asked to sign on few documents, which was in Hindi and I hardly understood anything. The investigating officer did tell me that they were closing the MUKADAMA. I was uncomfortable signing the documents so also getting myself photographed. 19-Nov-23, I filed an update to the two complaints filed on National Crime Reporting Portal. As on date the status of the 3 cyber complaints ssyas under process by the police. Now I am told by Murthal Police Station that on 03-Nov-23 they had released me on temporary bail and they want me to appear in the court of permanent bail. I am truly innocent and not guilty in the mentioned notice / case registered by Murthal Police Station. On 08-Jan-23, I once again submitted my please of innocence to Commissioner of Polics \u2013 Sonipat. But still I am being asked to come to the court for getting permanent bail. Please advise on what I should do.",

Ensure you have legal representation during the proceedings. The Commissioner of Police Sonipat's support for the cancellation of the MUKADAMA is commendable, but legal action must be taken. Section 342 of the Indian Penal Code (wrongful detention), Section 354A (sexual harassment), and Section 506 (criminal intimidation) are considered serious offenses in India. It is imperative to have legal guidance from a criminal law specialist in order to properly traverse the legal system. Maintain records for your defense and keep updating the National Crime Reporting Portal with any new information.   Hope this helps you."

I took loans for 40 lakhs and constructed a 4 storey house over that plot. Wife is earning just 28,000/month. Father in law is BPL along with all of his family members. They are holding this property as trustee.      Wife found adulterous, attacked me and my mother & denied to name my property back.      I instituted suit for permanent injunction & consequential relief in August 2017 against wife defendant no.1 while her father defendant no.2 ex-parte and GPA giver was not made a party. Court referred case to mediation center and a compromise got signed for agreeing 50% share for me/plaintiff in lieu of acceptance of loans borrowed by me/plaintiff for 40 lakhs. Settlement was signed by plaintiff/me and defendant 1 along with counsels of me & wife. Settlement contained clauses for condoning of her cruelties on me & my mother.    Finding impossible to stay united & to avoid condonation in divorce case; on oral agreement to wife; the suit was withdrawn on wrong advice without liberty while the mediation report was under consideration.      A legal notice sent in Dec 2017 to name the 50%share in plaintiff's name which was never replied.      Again, a new suit was instituted after 30 days of notice period in January 2018 for same relief with same title and same subject matter for permanent injunction and consequential relief with different cause of action (i.e. legal notice). A stay order u/o 39 rule 1 &2 along with section 151 CPC was granted and issue framed for maintainability.      Now, a top lawyer advised that this new suit is wrongly filed and will be dismissed according to order 23 or Order 2 rule 2 or section 11 of CPC. Also because the relief sought via this suit was also available also through previous suit. Lawyer also said that at max I can get 40 lakhs agreed in settlement.    Questions:    1. Whether my suit is maintainable?    2. Whether I have no locus standi to file the suit?   3. Whether cause of action is different or same?   4. Whether suit is within limitation?   5.

BARUN KUMAR NAHAR ..... PLAINTIFF  Through Mr. Amit Sibal, with Ms. Prachi Vasisht, Adv.  versus PARUL NAHAR & ANR. ..... DEFENDANTS  Through Mr. Medhanshu Tripathi for D-1  Ms. Geeta Luthra, Sr. Adv. with  Mr. S.K. Arora, Mr. Atin Rastogi & Mr. Gautam  Bajaj for D-2  CORAM:  HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE KAILASH GAMBHIR IA No. 17986/11 (O. 39 Rule 1 &2 of CPC) 1. By this order I propose to decide the application moved by the plaintiff under Order 39 Rules 1&2 read with Section 151 of CPC. 2. Before I deal with the rival contentions raised by the counsel for the parties, it would be appropriate to give brief summary of the facts of the present case. The plaintiff herein is a father-in-law of the defendant no.1 and father of defendant no.2. The plaintiff has filed the present suit for permanent and mandatory injunction. A decree of mandatory injunction has been sought by the plaintiff to direct the defendant no.1 to vacate the premises bearing No. B-197, Greater Kailash, Part-I, New Delhi, while a decree of permanent injunction has been sought by the plaintiff so as to restrain the defendant no.1, her parents, agents, representatives, assignees, associates etc. from creating disturbance in the peaceful possession and occupation of the plaintiff's self-acquired property bearing no. B-197, Greater Kailash, Part-1, New Delhi. In prayer Para (b) instead of claiming permanent injunction the plaintiff has wrongly claimed mandatory injunction and such inadvertent mistake on the part of the plaintiff can be ignored. 3. The main allegation of the plaintiff in the present suit is that he is the sole and absolute owner of the property bearing no. B-197, Greater Kailash, Part-1, New Delhi consisting of ground and first floor. It is also the case of the plaintiff that the said property was purchased by him vide sale deed dated 10.8.1971 through his own funds and since then the plaintiff and his wife are residing in the same property. It is also the case of the plaintiff that he and his wife aged around 80 years and 74 years respectively are suffering from various old age ailments. It is also the case of the plaintiff that the defendant no.1 is of a very violent nature and she has made the life of the plaintiff and his wife a living hell. It is also the case of the plaintiff that the defendant no.1 is having matrimonial discord with her husband, defendant no.2, herein and the plaintiff and his wife are being subjected to suffer at the hands of the defendant no.1 because of such matrimonial dispute between the spouses. It is also the case of the plaintiff that he and his wife are living on the ground floor premises and the defendant no.2 being the son of the plaintiff was occupying the first floor of the premises as a licensee. It is also the case of the plaintiff that the defendant no.1 being the wife of defendant no.2 was also using the first floor until the relations between the defendant no.1 and defendant no.2 became edgy. It is also the case of the plaintiff that the defendant no.1 was having extra marital affair with servant Shambhu and the relationship between the defendant no.1 and defendant no.2 turned embittered after the discovery of the said extra marital affair . It is also the case of the plaintiff that the defendant no.1 left the house and she had also executed an affidavit stating her separation from her husband, i.e. defendant no. 2 herein. It is also the case of the plaintiff that the right of the defendant no.1 to live as wife of defendant no.2 got terminated in terms of the affidavit dated 18.10.2010. It is also the case of the plaintiff that the temporary stay of the defendant no.1 as a guest on the first floor of the premises since March 2011 does not give her any right to occupy the said premises as her statutory right to occupy the premises was by virtue of her being a wife of defendant no.2 with whom her relationship is claimed to be terminated w.e.f. 18.10.2010. It is also the case of the plaintiff that in the first week of August 2011, defendant no.1 had assaulted and pushed the wife of the plaintiff after which she fell on the floor and injured herself. It is also the case of the plaintiff that defendant no.1 misbehaves, beats and abuses the domestic staff and because of such demeanor by the defendant no.1, the domestic staff left the said premises leaving the plaintiff and his wife with no option but to take care of the entire household work themselves. It is also the case of the plaintiff that the defendant no.1 and her father have continuously blackmailed the plaintiff and his family members to give crores of rupees or else they would implicate the plaintiff and his family members in false and frivolous cases. It is also the case of the plaintiff that on 22.9.2011, the defendant no.1 abused the plaintiff and as a result whereof the plaintiff had to be rushed to the Doctor and he was strictly advised by the Doctor to avoid any kind of stress and similarly on 28.9.2011 the defendant no.1 had abused the wife of the plaintiff with filthy language , consequently she was rushed to the Doctor and the Doctor advised that the environment of the plaintiff's wife should be changed. Similar incident as per the plaintiff had also taken place on 31.10.2011. It is also the case of the plaintiff that the wife of the plaintiff has been diagnosed to be suffering from a serious heart problem and because of the extreme stress her sugar level had also shot up to an alarming proportion. With these allegations, the plaintiff prayed that the defendant no. 1 be directed to vacate the suit property so that the plaintiff and his wife are able to lead the evenings of their lives peacefully without any stress or trauma. 4. In the original suit the plaintiff did not seek the relief of mandatory injunction so as to seek vacation of defendant No.1 from the subject premises. But later on, the plaintiff incorporated the said relief of grant of mandatory injunction through an amendment. Along with the amended suit the plaintiff also filed a fresh application under Order39 Rule 1 & 2, CPC for the grant of interim mandatory injunction to seek a direction to the defendant No.1 to vacate the subject premises till the final disposal of the suit. 5. Defendant No.1, the daughter-in-law of the plaintiff has mainly contested the said stay application while defendant No.2 who is the son of the plaintiff has come in support of the said application. 6. Counsel for the plaintiff very strongly contended that the suit property in question is a self-acquired property of the plaintiff who had purchased the same by way of registered Sale Deed dated 10.8.1971 and therefore he is fully entitled to peacefully reside in the said property along with his old wife without any sort of interference or disturbance at the hands of defendant No.1. Counsel also submitted that plaintiff and his wife are senior citizens aged about 80 and 74 years respectively, suffering from various ailments and because of continuous and unabated torture at the hands of defendant No.1, the life of the petitioner and his wife has become miserable and they can collapse at any time if defendant No.1 continues to reside in the said property. Counsel further submitted that defendant No.2 has already shifted from the said premises to reside in a rented accommodation and instead of shifting with her husband, the defendant No.1 has continued residing at the suit property and has been harassing the plaintiff and his wife by abusing and humiliating them daily and also calling the police every now and then on false pretexts so as to further embarrass them in the presence of their neighbors. Counsel also submitted that due to the marital discord, defendant No.1 had left the said premises permanently on 18.10.2010 and she had also signed an affidavit dated 18.10.2010 to that effect but again she had illegally occupied the guest room on the ground floor of the said premises. Counsel also submitted that defendant No.1 had no legal right to stay in the said premises and her occupation was permissive only when she was residing in the suit property with her husband, defendant No.2 herein and once defendant No.2 has shifted to some other accommodation, the defendant No.1 cannot force her to stay in the premises which is exclusively owned by the plaintiff. It was also submitted that defendant No.2 had given many proposals to defendant No.1 to reside with him at the rented accommodation or to reside in some other alternative accommodation at par with the rented accommodation of defendant No.2 or to accept an amount to the tune of Rs.30,000 towards the monthly rent for an accommodation to be selected by her but none of these offers have been accepted by defendant No.1. Counsel further submitted that the legal position is now well settled that daughter-in-law has no legal right whatsoever to reside in the property owned by her parents-in-law and parents- in-law have no obligation to provide a residence to their daughter-in-law. In support of his arguments counsel for the plaintiff has placed reliance on the following judgments:- 1. S.R. Batra and Anr. v. Taruna Batra, (2007) 3 SCC 2. Kavita Chaudhari v. Eveneet Singh and Anr., 2012 (130) DRJ 83 3. Neetu Mittal v. Kanta Mittal, 152 (2008) DLT 691 4. Umesh Sharma v. State, 2010 (115) DRJ 88 5. Kulwant Singh v. Laljee Kent( DR.) and ors., 162 (2009) DLT 625 6. Shumita Didi Sandhu v. Sanjay SinghnSandhu and ors., 174 (2010) DLT 79 (DB) 7. Counsel for the plaintiff also submitted that defendant No.1 had earlier obtained an ex-parte injunction from the court of Ld. MM, Saket in a petition filed by her under the Domestic Violence Act by suppressing the fact of filing of the present suit by the plaintiff. Counsel further informed this court that the said ex-parte order dated 20.12.2011 already stands vacated vide order dated 11.1.2012. 8. Counsel further argued that there are no fetters on the powers of this court to grant interim mandatory injunction in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant no. 1, keeping in view the facts of the present case where the life of the plaintiff and his wife have become hell because of the continuous nuisance, torture and harassment being caused by defendant No.1. To support his arguments counsel for the plaintiff placed reliance on judgments of the Hon'ble Apex court in the case of Sant Lal Jain. Vs. Avtar Singh (1985) 2 SCC 332 and Dorab Cawashji Warden v. Coomi Sorab Warden, (1990) 2 SCC 117. 9. On the other hand Counsel for the defendant No.1, strongly opposed the grant of the said relief of mandatory injunction at the interim stage. Counsel submitted that the relief of temporary injunction is a purely equitable relief and the same cannot be granted to a person who has played fraud upon the court by suppressing material and vital facts from the court. Counsel submitted that the plaintiff is a permanent resident of Calcutta and came to Delhi in the year 2010 in connivance and conspiracy with defendant No.2 with the sole objective to ouster the defendant No.1 from the suit property. Inviting attention of this court to the documents like voter ID card, passport , certified copy of the application dated 23.4.2012 moved before the family court of Saket, counsel submitted that these documents squarely goes on to show that the plaintiff is a permanent resident of Calcutta and not of Delhi. Counsel also submitted that the plaintiff has played serious fraud upon the court by not disclosing this very fact thereby violating, Section 17 of the Representation of People Act, 1951. 10. The next limb of argument taken by counsel for defendant No.1 was that grant of interim mandatory injunction by this court in favour of the plaintiff would amount to finally decreeing the present suit in favour of the plaintiff and therefore the said relief at the interim stage is impermissible in terms of the settled legal position. 11. The next argument advanced by counsel for defendant No.1 was that the suit property is an ancestral property and being ancestral property it falls in the category of 'shared household' in terms of Section 2(s) of the Domestic Violence Act, 2005. Counsel also submitted that the children of the defendants have every right to reside in the suit property under the Hindu Mitakshara Law. 12. Counsel further argued that the allegations levelled by the plaintiff in the present suit are infact reproduction of the allegations levelled by the husband-defendant No.2 in other proceedings i.e. divorce case and a petition filed by him under Guardianship and Wards Act. 13. Counsel also argued that the amended application under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC is not maintainable in the eyes of law as the amendment envisaged under Order 6 Rule 17, CPC relates to the amendment of pleadings, which includes the plaint and the written statement, and not the amendment of applications under Order 39 Rule 1 and 2 filed by the parties. 14. Counsel further argued that the present suit is bad for non-joinder of children of the defendants as the necessary parties, as the children of the defendants who are also residing in the said property along with defendant No.1, are the ones whose rights would be equally affected by the decision of the court. 15. Counsel further argued that as per the settled principles for the grant of interim injunction, the plaintiff is not entitled for the grant of any interim relief of mandatory injunction. 16. In support of his arguments counsel for the defendant placed reliance on the following judgments:- 1. S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu (Dead) by L.R.s v. Jaggannath (Dead) by L.R.s and others, (1994) 1 SCC 1 2. Indore Development Authority v. Mangal Amusement Private Limited, (2010) 12 SCC 514 3. Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. and others v. Prem Chand Premi and another, (2005) 13 SCC 505 4. Purshottam Vishandas Raheja and another v. Shrichand Vishandas Raheja, (2011) 6 SCC 73 5. Davender Lal Mehta v. Sh. Dharmender Mehta and Anr., AIR 2009 DELHI 189 6. Ramachandra Tanwar v. Ram Rakhmal Amichand and another, AIR 1971 RAJASTHAN 292 7. Nandan Pictures Ltd. v. Art Pictures Ltd. and others, 1956 CALCUTTA 428 8. B.P. Achala Anand v. S. Appi Reddy and another, (2005) 3 SCC 313 9. S. R. Batra and anr. v. Smt. Taruna Batra, 2006 (4) Crimes 433 (SC) 17. During the course of arguments counsel for defendant No.1 also gave a proposal that defendant No.1 would shift along with her two minor children to the first floor of the suit property so that the plaintiff and his wife and defendant No.1 with her children can peacefully reside in separate portions of the said property and there is no face-off between the plaintiff and defendant No.1. Counsel also submitted that defendant No.1 is prepared to give an undertaking not to enter in the ground floor of the premises occupied by the plaintiff but will allow the plaintiff and his wife to enter the first floor so that they can meet their grand children. 18. In his rejoinder arguments, counsel for the plaintiff stated that the plaintiff has not played any kind of fraud upon the court by not disclosing about his residential property in Calcutta. He stated that he has been residing in the suit property since the year 1971and to support his stay in the Delhi Property, the plaintiff has also placed on record various documents viz. voter ID card and electricity bills etc. Counsel further submitted that in the given facts of the present case this court has abundant power to grant the relief of interim mandatory injunction. Counsel also submitted that the grant of interim mandatory injunction cannot be confined only to restore the last uncontested status quo of the property. counsel also argued that the proposal given by defendant No.1 to permit her to reside on the first floor of the property is not a workable solution as the two floors of the suit property are inextricably inter- connected through a common entrance, internal staircase and the common kitchen which is located at the ground floor and even with such an arrangement the verbal and physical abuse and harassment at the hands of the defendant no. 1 would still be persistent. 19. I have heard learned counsel for the parties at considerable length and given my anxious consideration to the arguments advanced by them. I have also carefully perused the material placed on record by them. 20. Through the present application the plaintiff by way of interim mandatory injunction is seeking direction to the defendant no. 1 to vacate the premises bearing number B-197, Greater Kailash, Part-I, New Delhi. Plaintiff has claimed that he is residing in the said property along with his aged wife of 74 years. It is also the case of the plaintiff that he and his wife are suffering from various ailments and in support thereof he has placed on record some medical documents as well. The age of the plaintiff and his wife is not in dispute and so far as the ownership of the property is concerned, the plaintiff has placed on record the photocopy of the Sale Deed dated 10.8.1971 and therefore the title of the plaintiff to the subject property also cannot be of any dispute. It is also not in dispute that defendant No.2 who is the son of the plaintiff has already walked out from the said accommodation to reside in a rented accommodation while his wife, defendant No.1 along with two children continued to live in the subject property. It is also a matter of record that the plaintiff and defendant No.1 have been lodging several complaints to the police against each other and the kind of allegations leveled by them demonstrates the extent of hatred and venomous they have against each other. 21. Ld. counsel for defendant No.1 heavily placed reliance on the preposition that grant of interim mandatory injunction in favour of the plaintiff would result in granting final relief to the plaintiff and secondly that the grant of interim mandatory injunction can be granted only to restore the status quo ante. To support his argument counsel for defendant No.1 placed reliance on the case of Dorab Cawasji Warden v. Coomi Sorab Warden & Ors. (supra). Counsel for the plaintiff also placed reliance on the same case to counter the argument of counsel for defendant No. 1. The Apex Court in this case observed that the relief of interlocutory and mandatory injunction is generally granted to preserve or restore the status quo of the last non-contested status which preceded the pending controversy until the final hearing when full relief may be granted or to compel the undoing of those acts that have been illegally done or the restoration of that which was wrongfully taken from the party complaining. The following paras from the said judgment would further amplify the legal position. \"15. In one of the earliest cases in Rasul Karim A Anr. v. Pirubhai AMrbhm, ILR 1914 38 Bom. 381, Beaman, J. was of the view that the court's in India have no power to issue a temporary injunction in a mandatory form but Shah, J. who constituted a Bench in that case did not agree with Beaman, J. in this view. However, in a later Division Bench judgment in Champsey Bhimji & Co. v. The Jamna Flour Mills Co. Ltd., two learned Judges of the Bombay High Court took a different view from Beaman, J. and this view is now the prevailing view in the Bombay High Court. In M. Kandaswami Chetty v. F. Subramania Chetty , a Division Bench of the Madras High Court held that court's in India have the power by virtue of Order 39 Rule 2 of the CPC to issue temporary injunction in a mandatory form and differed from Beaman's view accepting the view in Champsey Bhimji & Co. v. Jamna Flour Mills Co. (supra). In Israil v. Shamser Rahman, it was held that the High Court was competent to issue an interim injunction in a mandatory form. It was further held in this case that in granting an interim injunction what the Court had to determine was whether there was a fair and substantial question to be decided as to what the rights of the parties were and whether the nature and difficulty of the questions was such that it was proper that the injunction should be granted until the time for deciding them should arrive. It was further held that the Court should consider as to where the balance of convenience lie and whether it is desirable that the status quo should be maintained. While accepting that it is not possible to say that in no circumstances will the Courts in India have any jurisdiction to issue an ad interim injunction of a mandatory character, in Nandan Pictures Ltd. v. Art. Pictures Ltd. and Ors., AIR 1956 Cal 428, a Division Bench was of the view that if the mandatory injunction is granted at all on an interlocutory application it is granted only to restore the status quo and not granted to establish a new state of things differing from the state which existed at the date when the suit was instituted. 16. The relief of interlocutory mandatory injunctions are thus granted generally to preserve or restore the status quo of the last non-contested status which preceded the pending controversy until the final hearing when full relief may be granted or to compel the undoing of those acts that have been illegally done or the restoration of that which was wrongfully taken from the party complaining. But since the granting of such an injunction to a party who fails or would fail to establish his right at the trial may cause great injustice or irreparable harm to the party against whom it was granted or alternatively not granting of it to a party who succeeds or would succeed may equally cause great injustice or irreparable harm, courts have evolved certain guidelines. Generally stated these guidelines are: (1) The plaintiff has a strong case for trail. That is, it shall be of a higher standard than a prima facie case that is normally required for a prohibitory injunction. (2) It is necessary to prevent irreparable or serious injury which normally cannot be compensated in terms of money. (3) The balance of convenience is in favour of the one seeking such relief. 17. Being essentially an equitable relief the grant or refusal of an interlocutory mandatory injunction shall ultimately rest in the sound judicial discretion of the Court to be exercised in the light of the facts and circumstances in each case. Though the above guidelines are neither exhaustive or complete or absolute rules, and there may be exceptional circumstances needing action, applying them as prerequisite for the grant or refusal of such injunctions would be a sound exercise of a judicial discretion.\" 22. It would be seen from the aforesaid observation of the Apex Court in the said case that the relief of interlocutory mandatory injunction is granted generally to preserve or restore the status quo of the last contested status. The expression 'generally' in the above observation gives a clear indication that the grant of interim mandatory injunction does not only confine to restore the status quo of the last contested status. The Apex Court in the said judgment further observed that being essentially an equitable relief the grant or refusal of an interlocutory mandatory injunction shall ultimately rest on the sound judicial discretion of the Court to be exercised in the light of the facts and circumstances of each case. The Court also observed that there may exist exceptional circumstances for the grant or refusal of such injunction and it would ultimately depend on the facts of each case for the Court to exercise the equitable jurisdiction in favour of one party in preference to the other party. 23. Testing the present case in the light of aforesaid discussion, the court is of the view that the plaintiff has been able to establish a very strong prima- facie case in his favour. The defendant No.1 being a daughter-in-law has no right to reside in the subject property which belongs to her father-in-law as the said property is not covered by the definition of 'shared household', the same being neither a joint family property in which her husband is a member, nor it belongs to the defendant no. 2 and is not even a rented accommodation owned by the defendant No.2. 24. Referring to the decision of the Apex court in the case of S. R. Batra and Anr. v. Taruna Batra, (2007) 3 SCC 169, which has extensively dealt with the legal position regarding the right of a daughter-in-law in a shared household under Section 17(1) of the DV Act, it was held as under:- \"16. There is no such law in India, like British Matrimonial Homes Act, 1967 and in any case, the rights which may be available under any law can only be as against the husband and not against the father-in-law or mother-in-law. 29. As regards Section 17(1) of the Act, in our opinion the wife is only entitled to claim a right to residence in a shared household, and a shared household would only mean the house belonging to or taken on rent by the husband, or the house which belongs to the joint family of which the husband is a member... 30. No doubt, the definition of \"shared household\" in section 2(s) of the Act is not happily worded, and appears to be the result of clumsy drafting, but we have to give it an interpretation which is sensible and which does not lead to chaos in the society.\" 25. In S.R. Batra case (supra), the property in question belonged to the mother-in-law and there also the defence taken by the daughter-in-law was that the said property was a joint family property and therefore she enjoyed a protection under Section 17(1) of Domestic Violence Act, 2005. However, the court took a view that daughter-in-law cannot claim any right in an accommodation which belongs to mother-in-law or the father-in-law as such an accommodation does not satisfy the test of share household accommodation as envisaged under Section 2(s) of the Domestic Violence Act, 2005. 26. The aforesaid view was reiterated by this court in the case of Neetu Mittal v. Kanta Mittal reported in 152 (2008) DLT 691 and the relevant Paras of the same are reproduced as under:- \"8. ... 'Matrimonial home' is not defined in any of the statutory provisions. However, phrase \"Matrimonial home\" refers to the place which is dwelling house used by the parties, i.e., husband and wife or a place which was being used by husband and wife as the family residence. Matrimonial home is not necessarily the house of the parents of the husband. In fact the parents of the husband may allow him to live with them so long as their relations with the son (husband) are cordial and full of love and affection. But if the relations of the son or daughter-in-law with the parents of husband turn sour and are not cordial, the parents can turn them out of their house. The son can live in the house of parents as a matter of right only if the house is an ancestral house in which the son has a share and he can enforce the partition. Where the house is self-acquired house of the parents, son, whether married or unmarried, has no legal right to live in that house and he can live in that house only at the mercy of his parents upto the time the parents allow. Merely because the parents have allowed him to live in the house so long as his relations with the parents were cordial, does not mean that the parents have to bear his burden throughout the life. 9. Once a person gains majority, he becomes independent and parents have no liability to maintain him. It is different thing that out of love and affection, the parents may continue to support him even when he becomes financially independent or continue to help him even after his marriage. This help and support of parents to the son is available only out of their love and affection and out of mutual trust and understanding. There is no legal liability on the parents to continue to support a dis-obedient son or a son which becomes liability on them or a son who dis-respects or dis- regards them or becomes a source of nuisance for them or trouble for them. The parents can always forsake such a son and daughter-in-law and tell them to leave their house and lead their own life and let them live in peace. It is because of love, affection, mutual trust, respect and support that members of a joint family gain from each other that the parents keep supporting their sons and families of sons. In turn, the parents get equal support, love, affection and care. Where this mutual relationship of love, care, trust and support goes, the parents cannot be forced to keep a son or daughter in law with them nor there is any statutory provision which compels parents to suffer because of the acts of residence and his son or daughter in law. A woman has her rights of maintenance against her husband or sons/daughters. She can assert her rights, if any, against the property of her husband, but she cannot thrust herself against the parents of her husband, nor can claim a right to live in the house of parents of her husband, against their consult and wishes. 27. In yet another case Shumita Didi Sandhu v. Sanjay Singh Sandhu & Ors. reported in 174 (2010) DLT 79 (DB), the Division Bench of this Court took a view that a property which neither belongs to husband nor is taken on rent by him, nor is a joint family property in which husband is a member, cannot be regarded as shared household and, therefore, the daughter-in-law has no right to claim right to stay in such a property, which belongs to either the father-in-law or mother-in-law. The Hon'ble Division Bench also held that the right of residence which a wife undoubtedly has does not mean right to reside in a particular property and it is only in that property in which the husband has a right, title or interest that wife can claim residence and that too if no other commensurate accommodation is provided by the husband. The following paragraphs from the said judgment are reproduced as under:- \"40. ...the concept of maintenance, insofar as a Hindu lady is concerned, necessarily encompasses the provision for residence. Furthermore, the provision for residence may be made either by giving a lump sum in money or property in lieu thereof. It may also be made by providing, for the course of the lady's life, a residence and money for other necessary expenditure. Insofar as Section 17 of the said Act is concerned, a wife would only be entitled to claim a right of residence in a \"shared household\" and such a household would only mean the house belonging to or taken on rent by the husband, or the house which belongs to the joint family of which the husband is a member. The property which neither belongs to the husband nor is taken on rent by him, nor is it a joint family property in which the husband is a member, cannot be regarded as a \"shared household\". Clearly, the property which exclusively belongs to the father-in-law or the mother-in-law or to them both, in which the husband has no right, title or interest, cannot be called a \"shared household\". The concept of matrimonial home, as would be applicable in England under the Matrimonial Homes Act, 1967, has no relevance in India. 41. In the light of the aforesaid principles, the appellant/plaintiff would certainly have a right of residence whether as a part of maintenance or as a separate right under the said Act. The right of residence, in our view, is not the same thing as a right to reside in a particular property which the appellant refers to as her 'matrimonial home'. The said Act was introduced, inter alia, to provide for the rights of women to secure housing and to provide for the right of the women to reside in a shared household, whether or not she had any right, title or interest in such a household.\" 28. I have also had occasion to deal with some-what similar situation in the case of Kavita Chaudhari v. Eveneet Singh and Anr., reported in 2012 (130) DRJ 83, wherein the civil suit was filed by the mother-in-law seeking a decree of mandatory and permanent injunction against her son and daughter- in-law and in violation of the interim order passed by the court, the daughter- in-law failed to hand over the possession of the suit premises to the mother- in-law, thereby necessitating the Decree Holder i.e mother-in-law to file an execution petition. Following the principles laid down by the Apex Court in the case of S.R. Batra(supra), it was held as under in the following paras:- \"The property which neither belongs to the husband nor is taken on rent by him, nor is it a joint family property in which the husband is a member, cannot be regarded as a \u201eshared household?. Clearly, the property which exclusively belongs to the father-in-law or the mother-in-law or to both of them in which the husband has no right, title or interest, cannot be called a \u201eshare household?. The Hon'ble Division Bench in Sumita Didi (supra) also observed that the right of residence which a wife undoubtedly has does not mean her right to reside in a particular property although such a right in terms of Section 17 of The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act is a right to reside in a commensurate property. 17. At omega, this Court would like to observe that with a view to mitigate the oppression and inequality suffered by the fairer sex in this country from times immemorial; various woman friendly laws have been enacted so as to empower the women. It is a bitter truth that where on one hand these progressive laws have led to amelioration and advancement of the cause of the woman in this country, at the same time on the other hand these liberalized statutes have been flagrantly misused. The right of the woman to her matrimonial home is one such right which has been brought on the statute book to protect the woman from being left in lurch at the hands of the in-laws. However one cannot or may I say should not shy away from the hard hitting reality that it is not always the daughter in law who is berated but at times the in laws who are at the receiving end of the daughter in law's cantankerousness. It should not be for a moment consigned to oblivion that the parents in law have every right to live in peace in their own property and the right to property vested in them cannot be snatched away and used as a tool to harass them. In the facts of the case at hand, it is not in dispute before this Court that the said property bearing No. D-32, South Extension, New Delhi is the property owned by the mother-in-law which property was bequeathed in her favour by her father and therefore the said property cannot be treated as a joint family property. The daughter-in-law has no right to stay in the said property and with the exit of her husband from the same the judgment debtor has also lost the right to the said premises as well.\" 29. One can also not lose sight of the fact that none of the statutes which deal with the rights of a married woman in India, be it The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955; The Hindu Succession Act, 1956; The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956; The Protection Of Women From Domestic Violence Act, 2005 or The Code Criminal Procedure, 1973 confer any right of maintenance including residence for the married woman as against the parents of the husband. To illustrate, Sections 24 and 25 of The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 provides for the wife's right to pendent lite maintenance and Permanent Alimony only against her husband. Section 17 (1) of Domestic Violence Act, 2005 gives protection to the wife where the wife is only entitled to claim a right to residence in a shared household, and a shared household would only mean the house belonging to or taken on rent by the husband, or the house which belongs to the joint family of which the husband is a member within the meaning of Section 2(s) of the said Act. Section 18 of The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 enumerates the right of a Hindu wife to be maintained by her husband during her life time. Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 provides for monthly maintenance to wife, irrespective of her religion, if she has no source of income or means to maintain herself against her husband. The wife's right to maintenance which includes her residence in a commensurate property is, thus, only against the husband. Marriage is a social union of two persons called spouses that establishes rights and obligations between them. The concept of Matrimonial Home has evolved with the passage of time. The concept hails from the law of England under the Matrimonial Homes Act, 1967. There is no such absolute statute in India, like the British Matrimonial Homes Act, 1967, which clearly stipulates that the rights which may be available under marriage laws can only be as against the husband and not against the father-in-law or mother-in-law. However, it is quite discernible that the spouses in wedlock, are obliged to take care of each other and in case of any inter-se dispute; one can claim his right with respect to maintenance only against the other and not against the other family members. With the transient course it has been observed that with the advent of various women friendly laws, empowering the women with equal rights as that of a man/ husband, the remedy of women to ask for maintenance or to claim her right in the residence in a commensurate property is only restricted to her husband and not against her parents in law. A woman is only entitled to claim a right to residence in a shared household, and a shared household would only mean the house belonging to or taken on rent by the husband, or the house which belongs to the joint family of which the husband is a member. This means that she can assert her rights, if any, only against the property of her husband and cannot claim a right to live in the house of her husband's parents without their wishes and caprice. Law permits a married woman to claim maintenance against her in-laws only in a situation covered under section 19 of The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956. i.e. after the death of the husband and that too when she is unable to maintain herself out of her own earnings etc. It would not be abominable to say that even the parents/ parents in law at the fag-end of their lives, deserve to live a blissful, happy and a peaceful life, away from any tautness or worries. 30. In the light of the aforesaid legal position the defendant No.1, being a daughter-in-law of the plaintiff, has no right as against the plaintiff i.e. her father-in-law, to occupy any portion of the subject property, which is his self- acquired property. 31. The next thing to be seen in the present case is whether grant of such an interim mandatory injunction in favour of the plaintiff is imperative to prevent any irreparable loss or serious injury to the plaintiff which normally could not be compensated in terms of money. 32. In the facts of the present case, the plaintiff is aged about 80 years and his wife is aged about 74 years and they are suffering from various old age and other ailments. It is also an admitted position that the defendant No.1 left the subject premises on 20.10.2010 but again entered the said premises later although her husband started residing in a rented accommodation. Without going into the veracity of the complaints and counter complaints filed by the plaintiff and the daughter-in-law, one thing clearly emerges that the relation between the parties are highly embittered and they are on a complete war path. In my view, in such a scenario, while also considering the effect that such environment would have on the minor children, it would be preposterous for both the parties to stay under the same roof. Consideration may also be given to the well-known fact that the civil litigation takes years to conclude and by not granting interim stay in favour of the aged parents-in-law for all these years until the date of final decision of the case, they would be unnecessarily compelled to spend far end of their lives in a formulated, non- consensual and woeful environment. The court can also not lose sight of the fact that the defendant no. 1 has already been offered by the defendant no. 2 to reside with him in his rented accommodation or in the alternate has also been offered a sum of Rs. 30,000 to reside in some other rented accommodation. The defendant no. 1, being herself not happy with the conduct of her in-laws and husband, can avail this facility and shift to another equally good accommodation for which her husband is ready to bear the monthly rental expenses. By such an arrangement, in my opinion, interest of both the parties would be secured at such an interim stage. 33. Counsel for the defendant also raised a plea that plaintiff has played serious fraud upon the Court by not disclosing about having a residential house at Calcutta. Counsel also placed reliance on documents placed on record which clearly prove that the residence of the plaintiff is at Calcutta. Counsel also submitted that the plaintiff by having his residential address at two places has violated the relevant provisions of Representation of Peoples Act, 1951. Undeniably, it would have been better, had the plaintiff disclosed about having his residence at the Calcutta property too, as for claiming equitable discretionary relief one must place all the material and relevant facts before the court. Nevertheless, it has not been denied by defendant No.1 that plaintiff has been residing in the property bearing number B-197, Greater Kailash, Part-I, New Delhi since 2010. The court is of the view that the right of plaintiff has to be considered vis-a-vis Delhi property and not Calcutta property. The mere fact that plaintiff has another property at Calcutta cannot deprive him from residing in his Delhi property and therefore non-disclosure of a residential property at Calcutta in the present suit cannot be taken as a suppression of a material fact so as to dis-entitle the plaintiff from the grant of discretionary relief. There is thus no merit in this plea raised by defendant No.1. 34. Counsel for defendant No.1 also argued that there is an apparent collusion between the plaintiff and defendant No. 2 to throw out defendant No.1 from the alleged matrimonial home. This argument of counsel for defendant No.1 is also devoid of any merit as the Court has to prima-facie consider the right of defendant No.1 to reside in the property owned by her father-in-law and as discussed above, defendant No.1 has no legitimate right to stay in the self-acquired property of her parents-in-law unless permitted by the parents- in-law themselves. 35. In the light of the above discussion, the balance of convenience strongly lies in favour of the plaintiff as against defendant No.1. The non- grant of the interim mandatory injunction will result in causing more prejudice to the rights of the plaintiff in comparison with the alleged rights of the defendant No.1 to stay in an accommodation which is neither a matrimonial home nor a shared household accommodation. 36. Interim mandatory injunction is therefore granted in favour of the petitioner and against the defendant no. 1. Defendant No.1 is accordingly directed to vacate the subject property bearing No. B-197, Greater Kailash, Part-I, New Delhi and hand over peaceful possession of the same to the plaintiff within a period of one month from the date of this order. It is further directed that concerned Court seized with the petition filed by defendant No.1 under Domestic Violence Act shall decide the interim application of defendant No.1 for the grant of maintenance, which will include her right to a residence in the commensurate property as per the financial status of defendant No.2, within a period of one month from the date of this order. Defendant No.1 in the meanwhile is also set at liberty to shift to the rented accommodation as offered by defendant No.2 for her exclusive residence along with her children or to accept an amount of Rs.30,000 towards the amount of rent, pending disposal of her maintenance application before the concerned Metropolitan Magistrate/ Mahila Court . 37. With the above directions the present application stands disposed of. 38. It is ordered accordingly. KAILASH GAMBHIR 05 February, 2013"

Consult a senior advocate with civil experience and proceed immediately. Section 68 in The Indian Evidence Act, 1872  Proof of execution of document required by law to be attested.\u2014If a document is required by law to be attested, it shall not be used as evidence until one attesting witness at least has been called for the purpose of proving its execution, if there be an attesting witness alive, and subject to the process of the Court and capable of giving evidence: 1[Provided that it shall not be necessary to call an attesting witness in proof of the execution of any document, not being a Will, which has been registered in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Registration Act, 1908 (16 of 1908), unless its execution by the person by whom it purports to have been executed is specifically denied.]  Suspicious circumstances- As mentioned above that in proof of execution of will, a very heavy burden lies on the propounder to prove the due execution of will and to remove any suspicious circumstances surrounding the execution of particular will in question. Over the period of time judicial pronouncements provide a detail list of these suspicious circumsnatcs, not exhaustive though. These suspicious circumstances are:  The signature of the testator may be very shaky and doubtful or not appear to be his usual signature. The condition of the testator's mind may be very feeble and debilitated at the relevant time.  iii. The disposition may be unnatural, improbable or unfair in the light of relevant circumstances like exclusion of or absence of adequate provisions for the natural heirs without any reason.  The dispositions may not appear to be the result of the testator's free will and mind. The propounder takes a prominent part in the execution of the Will. The testator used to sign blank papers.  vii. The Will did not see the light of the day for long. viii. Incorrect recitals of essential facts. Other infirmities- Apart from the suspicious circumstances to which we have just referred, in some cases the wills propounded disclose another infirmity. Propounders themselves take a prominent part in the execution of the wills which confer on them substantial benefits. If it is shown that the propounder has taken a prominent part in the execution of the will and has received substantial benefit under it, that itself is generally treated as a suspicious circumstance attending the execution of the will and the propounder is required to remove the said suspicion by clear and satisfactory evidence. In such circumstances \u201cthe test of the satisfaction of judicial conscience\u201d becomes essential. The test merely emphasizes that, in determining the question as to whether an instrument produced before the court is the last will of the testator, the court is deciding a solemn question and it must be fully satisfied that it had been validly executed by the testator who is no longer alive. It is obvious that for deciding material questions of fact which arise in applications for probate or in actions on wills, no hard and fast or inflexible rules can be laid down for the appreciation of the evidence. It may, however, be stated generally that a propounder of the will has to prove the due and valid execution of the will and that if there are any suspicious circumstances surrounding the execution of the will the propounder must remove the said suspicions from the mind of the court by cogent and satisfactory evidence."

Generally engagement is treated as agreement to marry in future. If you never engaged, you need not worry. But if you engaged with someone to marry, you should know that you are in a binding contract. According to section 65 of Indian Contract Act any person who has received any advantage under such agreement or contract is bound to restore it, or to make compensation for it to the person from whom he received it. So, if you got any valuable gifts, engagement ring, or money, you must return it to avoid a suit by the other party entitled to claim in the Court of law. According to section 73 of ICA, \u201cwhen a contract has been broken, the party who suffers by such breach is entitled to receive, from the party who has broken the contract, compensation for any loss or damage caused to him thereby, which naturally arose in the usual course of things from such breach, or which the parties knew, when they made the contract, to be likely to result from the breach of it. Such compensation is not to be given for any remote and indirect loss or damage sustained by reason of the breach\u2026\u201d If the other party made arrangements for booking a club or hall or bought required goods for the purpose of engagement or marriage or both, the other party may sue you to recover compensation for such loss or damage."

Status is under investigation, chargesheet not filed.      My parents have received the notice from police to attend investigation. I didn't receive as my address in abroad is not known to my wife.      I have few queries based on how the case might proceed.      1) The woman SI who calls my parents to harass said that an LOC has been issued on my name. Can LOC be issued before chargesheet filed? Can LOC be issued before police notice delivered to me? Can LOC be issued without pending arrest warrant issued by court?      2) Can FIR be quashed before chargesheet is filed?      3) What stage is Non Bailable Warrant issued? Before or after chargesheet filed?      4) What stage is Proclaimed Offender status issued? One of my legal friend told me 498A is not in sec 82 list of crimes for which PO can be declared. Could you confirm?      5) Heard from legal friends that Red Corner Notice is not posted by Interpol in 498a cases anymore as its a marital dispute, maybe only in exceptional cases where the case is strong from complainant side. Could you confirm?      6) Also could you confirm that passport cancel or impounding for an NRI in 498a case is not easy except in exceptional circumstances based on few judgments from high courts and supreme court.      7) NRI if issued LOC/NBW/PO can travel to other countries without any issue exept India aslong as RCN not issued or passport not cancelled. Could you confirm?      Please advise above based on practical considerations instead of theoretical fears an NRI should live in, especially for some false cases primarily registered to extort money.",

However, if the person absconds to avoid the arrest, the drastic step of Proclamation for Persons Absconding needs to be taken, which is described in Section 82.. Proclamation for person absconding (Section 82(1)) -  If the court has reason to believe that a person has absconded to avoid the execution of his arrest warrant, the court may publish a written proclamation requiring such person to appear before it at the specified place and time. The date and time of appearance must not be less than thirty days from the date of proclamation. \u201cThe procedure laid down under Section 83 has to be followed strictly. Jurisdiction to pass attachment order cannot be assumed unless a proclamation under Section 82 Cr.P.C. has been issued. The normal rule is that the Court has to wait until the expiry of 30 days, to enable the accused to appear in terms of the proclamation. The words \u201cat any time after the issue of proclamation\u201d are not to be interpreted in isolation. The key for gathering the intention of the law makers is to be found in Section 82 Cr.P.C. Sections 82 & 83 Cr.P.C. are to be read in harmony. 2. The look out circular shall be valid only within Indian territories. The request for opening of LOC is required to be made to all immigration Check posts in the country in the Official Format prescribed by the MHA. The request for opening of LOC must invariably be issued with the approval of an officer not below the rank of Deputy Secretary to the Government of India/Joint secretary in the State Government/Superintendent of Police concerned at the district level. An LOC is valid for a period of one year. However, in case the originating agency wants to extend the validity beyond one year it can ask for the extension before the expiry of the one year period. If no request is made for the extension of the LOC within the stipulated period of one year, the Immigration Officer concerned is authorized to suspend the LOC. However there is no restriction to travel to other countries from another country other than India during the effective period of LOC 3. You have rights to disengage the current lawyer and engage another lawyer found to be genuine. 4. To find a good and genuine lawyer you have to rely upon your own sources who may help you to find one of your choice/desire.  5.

You may obtain a copy of the bail dismissal order and find out the facts as contained in the order. 7. There is no restriction to file AB second time even if it was dismissed at first instance. However you may have to confirm the details and cross verify the same with that of your lawyer, through your own source."

You may approach Consumer Court but it is time consuming. You may lodge complaint with RTO to cancel his license such business and they will impress upon them to refund your money. ========================================================================================= Cheated in online shopping? Here is how you can get justice Not futile to pursue online vendors who fail to deliver promised goods and services. Chitra Vittal from Bangalore wins out-of-court settlement from online vendor of cakes Far too many of us have felt cheated by online vendors but have let it go because of the apparent futility of fighting for our rights. However, Chitra Vittal\u2019s story tells us that it is indeed possible to win out-of-court settlements with online vendors with the help of consumer rights organizations like the International Consumer Rights Protection Council (ICRPC). Chitra Vittal from Bangalore ordered a combo package including cake from Flowers n Cakes to India, an online florist and gift store that guarantees same day delivery and the \u201cdelivery of fresh products \u2013 always.\u201dFlowers n Cakes to India failed to deliver the product on the specified day, and when they finally did deliver it the next day, the cake was \u201csmashed up, made of cheap wine\u201d and of a quality that was entirely unacceptable to the customer. When Ms Vittal attempted to complain about the non-delivery of the product on the scheduled day, she found that the customer care numbers displayed on the website were not attended. She managed to find contact details of their Hyderabad-based sub-vendor, only to be told that they had only received their orders from Flowers n Cakes to India the morning after the scheduled date.   Five days later, Ms Vittal complained about the delayed delivery of a substandard product over a chat conversation with the company representative, Rahul, who, according to her was rude and paid no heed to her complaints. Ms Vittal then approached Arun Saxena, President of ICRPC, which runs a consumer helpline. Mr Saxena sent an email to the vendor on behalf of Ms Vittal, informing them that they had conducted Unfair Trade Practices under Section 2 (1) (r) of the Consumer Protection Act. If the vendor did not refund the full amount to Ms Vittal and pay Rs50,000 as compensation for her losses, harassment and inconvenience, Mr Saxena said, severe action would be initiated against them, seeking higher compensation of Rs1 lakh with the legal costs.   What ensued was a series of emails exchanged among Mr Saxena, Ms Vittal and Flowers n Cakes to India, where the vendor attempted to seek refuge in its disclaimer against \u201cunavoidable delays\u201d. Ms Vittal felt that the vendors entirely ignored the accusation of no-response to complaints and were repeatedly rude to her. The emails reveal comments from the vendor to the tune of \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t understand simple English language then it\u2019s not our responsibility\u201d and \u201cshe is the only one who we can call Fake\u201d.  When Mr Saxena finally said that the matter was headed to consumer court and they would have to appear in person to justify their position, Flowers n Cakes to India beat a hasty retreat. With a sudden and radical change of tone, it sent a politely apologetic email to Ms Vittal, with the promise of a full refund on the same day."

        "query-text": "1. I am Mr Debanjan Mandal. I have a flat at Jal vayu Residency, 337 Motilal Gupta Road Kolkata-08. The flat was bought from Air Force Naval Housing Corporation. I have own the flat since 2006.       2. My in-laws are senior citizens and dependent on me since the demise of their only son. Since 2006, my in-laws have been staying in the said flat and looking after the property with Power of Attorney. I being in service, I use the house for staying during my leave period from service.      3. There is no registered housing society of Jal vayu Residency; however there is a working management committee which is elected every year. In 2016 during the Annual General Body Meeting, the house passed a rule saying that only family members (owner and his/her blood relatives - parents, brother, sister, wife, children) can stay in the flat. Anyone else staying would be treated as tenants and will be liable to pay tenant maintenance charge which is Rs 400 above the normal or owner maintenance charges.      4. Due to this policy, my in-laws were treated as tenants in my own flat and this has really hurt their feelings. They have rendered enormous service for the betterment of the housing complex and it's occupants since its inception in 2006. They have always felt a part of the society being my in-laws. They are proud that I am a service military officer and when such an alienating rule was made by the ex-military personals it has really dent their feelings and pride on the military.       5. I have taken up the matter with the management committee on the following grounds   (a) I have told that the house is a self occupied house as per my IT return and my family which includes my in-laws are using the house.   (b) I have told that they cannot define my in-laws as tenants on the basis that it does not fall in their definition of family.   (c) I have told in the letter that i will continue to pay as per owner rates till my query is answered by the committee. However they have not given me any reply and put me in the defaulter's list. This has been derogatory and insulting to me since i have always paid my dues in time.      6. I have never faltered on paying my maintenance charges. But due to the difference in charge and the difference in opinion between me and the committee, they have made me a defaulter and displayed my name in the defaulters list. This has hurt my reputation.      6. What are the probable course of action that I can explore legally to get my in-laws their due in the society and not be considered as tenants. is the management committee correct in considering my in-laws as tenants or taking tenant charges from me when the house is declared as a self occupied house.

                "response-text": "Dear Sir, The following information may kindly be read:  Bigamy act does not apply to Scheduled Tribes: HC Bigamy is an offence under Section 494 of the Indian Penal Code, punishable with seven years' rigorous imprisonment and fine. But this penal provision will not apply if the offender is a member of the Schedule Tribes. This is the import of a recent judgment of the Delhi high court. The verdict, rife with serious implications, was delivered by Justice M S A Siddiqui, while allowing a revision petition, setting aside orders of an additional sessions judge. The sessions judge had reversed an order of discharge passed by a metropolitan magistrate in a bigamy case. Surajmani Stella Kaujur, daughter of a former Union minister and the first wife of Durga Charan Hansdah, a senior RBI officer at Hyderabad (the petitioner before the high court), aggrieved by her husband's conduct in marrying a second time, lodged a complaint under Section 494 IPC against him and his second wife. On the complaint being filed, process was issued against the petitioner's husband. After recording pre-charge evidence, the metropolitan magistrate discharged him on the ground that the complainant - the first wife -- had failed to prove that the second marriage allegedly contracted by the accused husband attracted the penal provisional Section 494 IPC. The first wife challenged the discharge order passed by the metropolitan magistrate before the additional sessions judge which was allowed vide orders dated February 26, 1997. The additional sessions judge directed the trial court to frame a charge against the accused husband under Section 494 IPC. Hence, the revision petition before the high court by the accused husband. Assailing the validity of the impugned order, Anukulchandra Pradhan, counsel for the accused husband, urged that the parties being members of the Scheduled Tribe, were not governed by the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, and the sessions judge had committed a patent illegality in applying the provision of the act to the facts of the present case and holding that a prima facie case had been made out against the petitioner-husband. Analysing the provisions of section 5 of the act which prescribes conditions to be fulfilled for the solemnisation of a marriage between two Hindus, the high court in its judgment said the marriage between two Hindus was null and void if either of them had a spouse living at the time of marriage. ''Section 17 of the act provides that any marriage between two Hindus solemnised after the commencement of the act is void if at the date of such marriage either party had a husband or a wife living. Thus, Section 17 of the act statutorily recognises the principle of monogamous marriages among Hindus, '' the high court added. The court said the provision of Section 17 has to be read in harmony and conjunction with the provision of Section 494 IPC as Section 17 clearly provides that provisions of Sections 494 and 495 IPC shall apply accordingly. The court said a complaint by a Hindu wife against her husband for the offence of bigamy was maintainable as the effect of Section 17 of the act was to make Section 494 IPC applicable to Hindus. 'In the instant case, it is an admitted fact that the petitioner and his second wife are members of the Scheduled Tribe. Under Section 2 (2) of the act it has been clearly stipulated that the act would not apply to the members of the scheduled tribe unless there is a notification of the central government in the official gazette, making the act applicable to the Scheduled Tribe,'' the court observed. Thus, Sub-section (2) of Section 2 of the act, the court said, has the effect of laying down that persons belonging to Scheduled Tribes will in the matter of marriages, continue to be governed by their personal law which was hitherto applied to them and not by any of the provisions of the act unless the central government by a notification directs that any such provision should be applicable to them. The court said no such notification had been produced before it and in view of the matter, it had no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the petitioner and his second wife were not governed by the provisions of the act and so the provisions of Sections 17 and 494 IPC were not attracted to the facts of the present case. ''The petitioner husband was rightly discharged by the metropolitan magistrate and the additional sessions judge has committed a manifest illegality in reversing the order of discharge. Consequently the impugned order cannot be allowed to stand as it has resulted in flagrant miscarriage of justice,'' Justice Siddiqui held."

                "response-text": "Respected sir... Following are the grounds which shall render a marriage void: 1. Bigamy: The first condition for valid Hindu marriage is that none of the parties to the marriage shall have a spouse living it the time of their marriage. If either of them has a spouse alive from an earlier marriage, their subsequent marriage is no marriage in the eyes of law. It is void ab initio and non est, i.e. non existent. 2. Persons falling within degrees of prohibited relationships: Section 3(g) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 defines \u2018degrees of prohibited relationships\u2019. It provides as follows: Lineal ascendants are to be seen from both sides, i.e. from the father\u2019s side as well as from the mother\u2019s side. So both the father and mother are lineal ascendants. Similarly father\u2019s father is a lineal ascendant whereas mother\u2019s mother is also a lineal ascendant. But a paternal grandmother is not a lineal ascendant but the wife of a lineal ascendant and hence would fall under clause ii. Similarly a maternal grand-father would fall under clause ii being the husband of a lineal ascendant. Clause ii would also cover daughter-in-law and son-in-law being the wife and husband respectively of one\u2019s lineal descendants i.e. son and daughter respectively. A paternal Aunt (Chachi) and a maternal Aunt (Maami) would fall under clause iii and two siblings along with other relations described in clause iv also fall in degrees of prohibited relationships. 3. Sapinda relations: Section 3(f) defines \u2018Sapinda relationship\u2019 as under: Sapinda relations can be illustrated as under: Suppose A is a boy. Now if he is considered as one generation, relatives falling in four more generations upwards from him from the side of his father shall be his Sapinda relations. Therefore, A\u2019s father, A\u2019s grand-father, A\u2019s great grand-father and the father of A\u2019s great grand-father shall all be A\u2019s Sapinda relations. But on the mother\u2019s side, this chain is to extend to only three generations which include A. Therefore, A\u2019s mother and A\u2019s maternal grand-mother only shall be A\u2019s Sapinda relations from the mother\u2019 side, A himself being one generation. By virtue of clause ii of sec 3(f), not only those who fall within the limits of sapinda relationship shall be sapinda to a person but also where two persons have a common lineal ascendant who is within the limits of sapinda relationship with reference to each of them, both of them shall also be sapinda to each other. For instance A and B are brothers born out of C who is their father. D is A\u2019s son and E is B\u2019s son. Here D\u2019s sapinda relations by degrees are A and C. Similarly E is Sapinda to B and C by degrees of relationship. Here D is not Sapinda to B by degrees because B does not fall in any of the four generations upward to D. But despite this, B shall still be Sapinda to D because both of them have a common lineal ascendant in C who is within the limits of Sapinda relationship to both B and D. Similarly A and E shall be sapinda to each other as they also have in C a common lineal ascendant who is within the limits of Sapinda relationship to both A and E.... Thanku"

There has been a recent judgment in which section 420 has been taken away in cases like this, but civil remedy will be open to the girl side to claim the amount which they might have spent (but surely a reasonable amount). And whatever they would be demanding they will have to show the receipts of the same  before the court of law if they happen to file any suit for recoverynof damages. In fact, it is good that you have decided before the marriage otherwise would be having kuch more trouble than now. And need not to worry about anything. And Lastly, if they demand something arbitrary amount as you have mentioned about the bond then you may have to challenge the same stating the same as fake."

New Delhi: After three years of litigation, a Delhi man's family realised on Friday that breaking a marriage alliance after enjoying the engagement party made them liable to reimburse the cost.In 2012, a government doctor finalized the marriage of his son, who was in the real estate business, with a girl from Thane in Maharashtra. The 'roka' (engagement ceremony) took place in Delhi on June 8, 2012. The girl's parents spent lavishly in entertaining the prospective groom's family and friends. But the boy's family later called off the alliance claiming that the girl's family had suppressed facts about her. Infuriated by the turn of events, the girl's parents filed a case under Section 420 (cheating) of IPC against the boy and his father in Thane. The father and son sought anticipatory bail from a Thane court, which after mediation proceedings asked them to pay Rs 1.50 lakh to the girl's parents towards the expenses they incurred on the ceremony. The boy's family claimed they had spent Rs 4.50 lakh for the ceremony. But the trial court asked them to compensate the girl's family. The boy's family paid up but the girl's family did not withdraw the case. The boy moved the Bombay HC seeking quashing of the case. The HC refused, saying a case of cheating was made out.   Appearing for the boy's family in the SC, senior advocate Rana Mukherjee told a bench of Justices J S Khehar and Arun Mishra that once the girl's family was compensated for their expenses, there was no question of any cheating in the matter, which was a case of a prospective matrimonial alliance going sour."

I could not believe on my ears when i heard that, as when i left india in 2008 i have transported the car to my in laws in UP and since then the car was never went out from UP. i have wrote a letter to SP explaining the whole situation and also provided a copy of car papers, insurances issued in UP, car pictures, address where the car is currently parked and our passport copies where the indian immigration authorities stamp says when we were in india and when we left country this is clearly not matching with the date with the date mentioned in FIR against me.      SP has forwarded the letter and supporting documents to investigating office without hearing, and investigating officers is not interested in any talk he just want the car and the driver to produced in police station.    Now the problem is my parents are 70 year old, (the car is parked throughout the time from 2008 since today in our house in UP,) can not travel with car to police station in bangalore. What action should i take further?      i have been discussing with lawyers and some say to file for quashing the FIR, some say send the car and drive to police for varification, and some say dont do anything until the chargesheet filed.      confused...      as the investigating officers now threatens to take action? i feel pitty myself when i left india why did i not transferred the Car registration number to UP RTO.      but anyway, please tell me what action should i take now? Quash the application in High court? Send the car and my father from UP to Bangalore, OR just wait? anything else???      also i want to know what action police can/will take now in order for me understand the consequences.

As required by the mediclaim Insurance company, FIR is required to be made and those people chose my car number (they just imagined the number) to lodge the police complaint and managed to get the FIR registered. Since the section put was for rash driving and cause serious injury I could manage to place a driver admitting as driving the said car at that place at that time and get bail.

Can the wife file for impotency test to be conducted without moving an application for annulment owing to husbands impotency when she is respondent in the divorce petition filed by husband on the ground of cruelty and desertion .   Will the husband has to go through harassment of going thru an impotency test.   What should the husband do know.",

Please see Sharda v. Dharmpal, (2003) 4 SCC 493. There is one caveat, though: There can be no roving enquiry by the court. There must be a strong prima facie for it to order such a test. It is not clear if this is the case here. The ordering of the test can be challenged if it appears to be unnecessary on the face of it. While impotence is indeed a ground of annulment, it is not obligatory for the other person to seek such annulment. If they want to live with their spouse despite their alleged sexual problems, there is nothing stopping them to. In fact, the wife can even refuse to live with the husband on account of the latter\u2019s impotence and yet demand maintenance (https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1317023/). If the test is no more than a nuisance to the husband, I would personally advise the husband to go through with it. Not doing so is likely to invite an adverse inference from the court. On the other hand, a favourable test will put his case for divorce beyond doubt. Granted, both agree that the marriage remains unconsummated, but the wife is saying it\u2019s because of the husband\u2019s impotence. Annulment can only be at the instance of the non-impotent party (presuming what the wife is saying is indeed true). I hope that answers your question. Follow-up queries welcome."

Once house constructed, he hardly stayed there and also abandoned my old parents and shifted to a rented house close to his father in-law on the insistence of his wife. Although he has repaid his housing loan and living in his new flat in another locality he is not returning my fathers original property document and gift deed in spite of several reminders. It is learnt he has also now taken additional loan of Rs. 3 lakh ( repayable in 10 years )using the same papers as security with out even informing my father. Clearly, his intention is to delay as my father is already aged 84 and usurp the entire property.

So, the fear of being caught by police or any other authority or even getting trapped in any criminal prosecution should not exist.  Answer to the other query is: Yes, if you have been scammed by an escort service and have been victim, you should report it to the authorities at the earliest. Also, try to gather evidences about the scam as the said evidences can be helpful in tracking down scammers and the black mailers. Black mailing is a form of criminal intimidation which is punishable under section 503 ipc and further if someone is blackmailing you with a video/photo etc. and is making demands for money or any other favor, such act amounts to extortion and is punishable under section 384 of IPC. Therefore, a formal complaint can be filed with police authorities under said sections in the concerned police station and if police fails to register FIR in the same matter you can go in the Court which is having jurisdiction and file complaint."

If the situation at home is intolerable then you may decide to file divorce case on the grounds of cruelty. You can quote the recent incident and the previous such incidences as reasons for cruelty.  For children custody, you can take the children with you, let him file child custody case which you can challenge properly before the court on the basis of merits in your side. As far as maintenance, you can file a maintenance petition under section 125 cr.p.c. in the same family court and seek maintenance for you and your children, dont worry about his unemployed status, you may mention his income from all other sources in your maintenance petition. The house in both of your names, shall be a jointly owned property, you have rights for 50% share in it."

So better you file a divorce case immediately in Indian court . After getting the decree of divorce legally marry the second wife. If your wife not appear before the court after serving summons to her you can get exparty divorce from the court it will take only 2 or 3 months. All other proceedings will take much time. Or other wise file a Divorce by Mutual Consent .The Conditions required under section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act are as follows: (i) Husband and wife have been living separately for a period of one year or more, (ii) That they are unable to live together, (iii) And that both husband and wife have mutually agreed that the marriage has totally collapsed, hence marriage should be dissolved. As per latest supreme court rulings Six-month cooling period for granting divorce is waived and you got early divorce decree"

I thought the dog must have lost its way back home. The dog followed me home. I then used my dog's leash and took her for a long walk but didn't find anyone looking for her. I got her back home & posted in a facebook dog group. I even put a post on my area dog group on whatsapp. Till evening, nobody came forward to claim her. Later in the evening, one guy from my whatsapp group put a poster of the missing dog which had the contact details and also said 10k reward for the person finding the dog. I called the number and the guy asked me to send the pics. I sent the pics and he confirmed that the dog belongs to him. As I work in the night shift, I asked the guy to come the next day morning. Though he agreed, later his mom and some of his other friends started calling me and abusing me as if I have stolen the dog. They also wanted the dog immediately. I asked them to wait for one hour so that I can reach home and see the owners before giving the dog away. One person from the whatsapp group who knew my house has called this guy and showed my place as well. Around 8 to 10 guys came to my house when I was not even present. My old handicapped aunty was at home. She was abused by these men. They did not wait for me to come home. They jumped the compound wall and took the dog with them. They trespassed into my house. I then filed an NCR at the nearby police station. The police has NOT taken any action after this. The dog owners seem to be highly influential and rich people in my area. The dog owners again came the next day morning with a police constable who is their family friend. This cop does not even belong to my area police station They have indirectly threatened me to be in their good books else the consequences will not be good. I'm new to my locality and they said they live past 20 years and they have more influence. Please help and advise. Thanks in advance.",

Supreme Court Says, \"Spouses owe rights and duties to each other and in their relationship they must act reasonably.\"  A petition for divorce under Section 13 (1)(1-a) and (iii) of the HMA on the ground of cruelty as well mental disorder.can be filed by you.  The Court observed, \u201cUndoubtedly, not allowing a spouse for a long time, to have sexual intercourse by his or her partner, without sufficient reason, itself amounts mental cruelty to such spouse. A Bench of Three Judges of this Court in Samar Ghosh Vs. Jaya Ghosh (2007) 4 SCC 511 has enumerated some of the illustrations of mental cruelty.\u201d... ================================================================================== India grants divorce to man whose wife refused to live with in-laws India\u2019s supreme court has granted a divorce to a man on the grounds of \u201ccruelty\u201d after his wife refused to share a home with her in-laws, effectively ruling that a married woman must live with her husband\u2019s family. Justice Anil R Dave, one of the the most senior judges in India, said the wife\u2019s desire to leave her in-laws\u2019 home was inspired by \u201cwestern thought\u201d and violated traditional values of Indian Hindus. \u201cIn normal circumstances, a wife is expected to be with the family of the husband after the marriage,\u201d stated the supreme court ruling, which also dismissed the wife\u2019s attempt to kill herself as a plot to \u201ctorture\u201d her husband and his relatives. There is no legal obligation for men to live with their parents, so the ruling still allows couples to live independently if men choose to set up a separate home. But the case had been seen as a test, pitting the rights of women against traditional Hindu values. Activists said the ruling left millions of women who were in unhappy marriages or with abusive husbands even more vulnerable. \u201cIf you look at the language the court has used, it\u2019s very regressive,\u201d said Tenzing Chusang, from the Women\u2019s Rights Initiative, a lawyers\u2019 collective. \u201cIf you make the grounds of divorce very lenient for men, it makes the woman very vulnerable.\u201d Divorce in India carries a huge stigma: there are few financial provisions for divorced women, and little legal support. Chusang said: \u201cIn India there\u2019s no such thing as shared matrimonial property or equal division of assets. All she gets if the husband divorces her, and that too after years of litigation, is a minimal maintenance payment. What can she do? She has to stay.\u201d The judge said the wife\u2019s claims that her husband was having an affair were fabricated, and that her suicide attempt was a devious attempt to manipulate her husband\u2019s family."

Amended Cheque Bounce Provisions- 143A & 148\u2026what is it? Ans:  Section 143A- It empowers the Court to order the drawer of the cheque to pay Interim Compensation  - 20% - Without depositing this amount the accused cannot defend the case. Section 148 \u2013 It empowers the Appellate Court to order payment pending the appeal against conviction The Appellate Court may order the appellant to deposit an amount which shall be a minimum of 20% of the fine or compensation awarded by the trial Court. This amount shall be in addition to the amount already paid by the appellant under Section 143A. It received the assent of the President and was notified in the Official Gazette on 02.08.2018    In which court do I need to file the complaint case under Section 138 N.I. Act in case drawer did not pay after receiving notice? A complaint case under Section 138 N.I. Act can be filed in any competent court in whose jurisdiction any of the following acts have occurred:a) Place of drawing of the cheque,b) Address of bank where cheque was presented (holders bank address),c) Address of bank where cheque is payable (drawers bank address)d) Place from where notice was received by drawer of chequea. It is possible that each of these four acts could have occurred at different localities. The complainant can choose any one the above places to determine jurisdiction of court where they wish to file complaint.2. What can I do if it has been more than 30 days since I received information of dishonour of cheque?If the cheque is still valid i.e. 3 months (currently) have not passed from the date of its issue, you can represent the cheque again to your banker as there is no restriction regarding the number of times a cheque can be presented and that every subsequent representation and dishonour gives rise to fresh cause of action for filing complaint. It may be noted that once a notice for payment is given then the holder must file a complaint under Section 138 N.I. Act within 30 days from expiry of notice period as a fresh cause of action will not arise if the cheque is presented again and it is dishonoured and failure to file complaint will lead to loss of remedy available under Section 138 N.I. Act.3. How long after notice has been served can I file a case against the drawer?After giving notice you need to file a complaint case against drawer under Section 138 N.I. Act within 30 days from the expiry of notice period i.e. 15 days. In other words you need to file complaint case against drawer within 45 days (15+30) from the date of issue of notice. Failure to do so will lead to loss of remedy under Section 138 N.I. Act; however, you can file a summary suit for recovery of money and initiate criminal proceedings under Section 420 I.P.C. within 3 years from date of issue of cheque.4. What can I do if I do not have the drawer's address?You need the address of the drawer of cheque to issue notice as contemplated under provisions of N.I. Act; also the address is necessary if you wish to avail other legal remedies available to you. You can send the notice to the last known address. In case the address of the drawer has changed and the drawer has not left a forwarding address and the notice is returned with the noting that addressee is not available at the address or addressee has left without leaving a forwarding address then you need to file a complaint case after 15 days (notice period) of receipt of such information or returned notice and within 30 days from expiry of notice period.

It is certain that they have a hidden agenda to trap you once you come to Indian soil and lodge all types of false criminal complaints against you including assault and criminal intimidation cases besides 498a, 406 IPC etc. No doubt your passport cannot be seized by police or court, the court may direct you to deposit your passport in court custody till disposal of the pending criminal cases against you and also may restrict your travel abroad as a condition to grant you bail.  Since your wife side people have already indulged in violent activities against you and your family members, you cannot expect them to abide by law even if you agree to their conditions. Their conditions and demands are unreasonable and unjustified. This is nothing but a threat posed to you forever in your life which you should not accept. Though the triple talaq method has come under criticization by top courts in India these days, no courts has opposed the method so far and has made it invalid or illegal.  To make it proper and legal, you may issue a legal notice to her mentioning her incurable disease as disaster to the married life especially when it affects the procreation, and also her unreasonable demands which are not valid in the eyes of law, you may advise her to accept khula for dissolution of your marriage under mutual terms and if she fails to accept or refuses then you would have no option than to opt for triple talaq to dissolve the marriage. This step would ensure a safe passage legally when it results into an adverse consequence and forces you to confront the situation."

The Guardians and Wards Act 1890 gives the family court the authority to decide child custody matters, however these decisions frequently clash with individual state legislation. Thus, in order to preserve equilibrium, the court consistently prioritizes the child's best interests and welfare over the parent's. This suggests that the child should live with the parent who can secure his financial interests, a solid education, and a good upbringing. Since the mother is typically regarded as the kid's natural guardian, she frequently receives custody, particularly when the child is younger. However, the father or any appropriate guardian may receive custody if the mother is determined to be unfit or incapable of giving the child the care and protection that the child needs."

The question arose again; In the absence of specific recital as conditions referred in the Transfer Deed by the Transferor i.e. Parent to Transferee i.e. Child(ren), whether Tribunal has a power to declare transfer as void?. The Kerala High Court decided; A deed can be declared as void on not fulfilling the two conditions; (a) transferee shall provide the basic amenities and basic physical needs to the transferor and (b) such transferee refuses or fails to provide such amenities and physical needs, and declared transfer as a fraud or coercion or under undue influence, as the case may be at the option of the transferor, even if there is NO recital of welfare clause in the Transfer Deed. {A}The aged parents expect that their children whom they have raised with love, affection and care shall care for them and tend to their needs in their sunset years. The moral obligation to support one's own aged parents can be found in different cultures and religions. Despite the preaching's by religion, teachings of teachers, learning's by education, moralities by cultures, traditions by customs, discourses by societies, upbringing by parents: The children when they become adults may abuse, torment, harass their own Parents and snatch their peace of mind, assets, properties. The situation is at times complicated when aged parents transfer their properties to their children out of love and affection expecting care in return and thereafter children become negligent and don't care! Then the Legislature, Law, Enactments, State, Courts of law have to rise and the Long Arms of Law are to be stretched to embrace the aged, Senior Citizens and Parents that are not able to defend themselves. The real tension arises when this moral obligation of children to care for their aged parents crystallizes into a duty enforceable by law and dirt is spilled on parents by their own children. {B} Incorporate stringent provisions in land registration deeds, that makes the transfer of property illegal or void if the elderly are not provided basic amenities by the beneficiaries. In a letter to all sub-registrars and joint sub-registrars on December 26,2012, the district additional deputy commissioner (G) has directed them to make it mandatory to include Section 23 of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizenship Act, 2007, in the registration deeds of property, that the elderly transfer to their children or legal heirs. The incorporation of the clause in the registries would in effect mean that the registries would be liable to be cancelled if the maintenance and physical needs of the senior citizens are not taken care of by the children or legal heir. Thirty five elderly persons of Amritsar had been benefited with the pronouncements of courts of the Tribunals under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act in 8 months.

Joginder Kumar U/s 279/338 IPC & 134/187 M V Act 5/12 FIR No. 305/10 PS Paschim Vihar vide memo Ex.PW1/B and conducted his personal search vide memo Ex.PW6/A.

He admitted that the car was not present at the spot when he reached the spot at about 9.30 pm. He also admitted that he had not obtained the signature of the complainant on the site plan. He also admitted that he had not got the mechanical inspection conducted in the present FIR and the same was conducted by the IO in FIR No. 642/10 PS Hansi City. He admitted that no judicial TIP was conducted by him. He denied the suggestion that he is deposing falsely. 15. Thereafter, the PE was closed. Statement of accused was recorded u/s 313 Cr.P.C, wherein he denied all the allegations and pleaded innocence. No DE was led despite opportunity. The accused had stated that he was not driving State v. Joginder Kumar U/s 279/338 IPC & 134/187 M V Act 6/12 FIR No. 305/10 PS Paschim Vihar the car in a rash and negligent manner as there was lot of traffic. He stated that the speed of the car was 20-30 kmph. He admitted that the accident had taken place from his car however, it was not his fault. The injured was trying to board a moving bus and his leg had got struck with his car. He stopped the car and made him sit in the car and took him to the hospital. However, injured stated raising hue and cry stating that they will kill him. He started protesting and asked him to stop the car. Hence, the accused stopped the car before the petrol pump and injured got down from the car. 16. I have heard the submissions addressed by the Learned APP for state and the Legal Aid Counsel for accused and carefully perused the documents on record. 17. Ld. Counsel for accused has submitted that the prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond all reasonable doubts. He submits that the site plan does not bear the signature of the complainant. Also, the mechanical inspection of the vehicle i.e car no. DL8CN 7359 was conducted on 04.11.2010 while the accident had taken place on 15.10.2010. He further submits that as per the prosecution the same car had met with an accident in FIR No.646/10 registered at PS Hansi, Haryana. Hence, the damage shown in the mechanical inspection report Ex.PW5/A cannot be read in evidence for the purpose of this case. He further submits that no judicial TIP was conducted by the IO and the manner in which the injured had identified the accused at the police station is quite doubtful. State v. Joginder Kumar U/s 279/338 IPC & 134/187 M V Act 7/12 FIR No. 305/10 PS Paschim Vihar 18. On the other hand, Ld. APP has submitted that the prosecution has successfully proved its case against the accused and he is liable to be convicted for the offence alleged. 19. To bring home the guilt of rash and negligent driving to the accused, three things need to be proved by the prosecution that too beyond any reasonable doubt. The three essential ingredients are as follows:- 1. That the accident actually took place. 2. That the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving. 3. That the accused was the person who was driving the vehicle at the relevant time. 20. Before proceeding further, let us discuss the meaning of the expressions \"rash\" and \"negligent\". These words i.e \"rash\" and \"negligent\", have not been defined in the Indian Penal Code. However as per Black's Law Dictionary, Eighth Edition the word 'Negligent' is characterized by a person's failure to exercise the degree of care that someone of ordinary prudence would have exercised in the same circumstances. 21. The terminology of criminal negligence has been discussed by Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of \"S.N. Hussain v. State of Andhra Pradesh\", AIR 1972 SC 685 as under : \"Criminal negligence on the other hand, is the gross and culpable neglect or failure to exercise that reasonable and State v. Joginder Kumar U/s 279/338 IPC & 134/187 M V Act 8/12 FIR No. 305/10 PS Paschim Vihar proper care and precaution to guard against injury either to the public generally or to an individual in particular, which, having regard to all the circumstance out of which the charge has arisen it was the imperative duty of the accused person to have adopted............Culpable negligence lies in the failure to exercise reasonable and proper care and the extent of its reasonableness will always depend upon the circumstances of each case\". 22. In the case at hand, it has been admitted by the accused that he was driving the car no. DL-8CN-7359 on the alleged date, time and place and that his car had struck the injured due to which injury was caused to him. Since the factum of accident has not been disputed by the accused nor has he disputed his identity or that of the above said car, hence, the only question before the court is whether the accused was driving the car in a rash and negligent manner, and had caused grievous injuries to Prem Singh or not. 23. There are no photographs of the spot on record. The court agrees with the submissions of the Ld. Counsel for accused that since the mechanical inspection report Ex.PW5/A was prepared after the car had met with the subsequent accident and same cannot be read in evidence. 24. However, the testimony of the injured i.e PW-1 has remained intact and no discrepancy whatsoever has been found in the same. He has clearly stated the State v. Joginder Kumar U/s 279/338 IPC & 134/187 M V Act 9/12 FIR No. 305/10 PS Paschim Vihar entire incident and how the car had come towards him when he was trying to board the bus. The accused has not been able to impeach the credibility of PW-1 or marr the veracity of his statement. 25. In \"Namdeo vs State of Maharashtra\", Crl Appeal No.914/2006 decided on 13.03.2007, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India relied upon its earlier judgment in \"Vadivelu Thevar vs State of Madras\" 1957 SER 981 wherein it was observed by the Hon'ble Court as under:- 1. As a general rule, a court can and may act on the testimony of a single witness though uncorroborated. One credible witness outweighs the testimony of a number of other witnesses of indifferent character. 2. Unless corroboration is insisted upon by statute, courts should not insist on corroboration except in cases where the nature of the testimony of the single witness itself requires as a rule prudence that corroboration should be insisted upon, for example in case of a child witness or an accomplice or a witness of analogue character. 3. Whether corroboration of the testimony of a single witness is or is not necessary must depend upon facts and circumstances of each case and no general rule can be laid down in a matter like this and much depend upon the judicial discretion of the judge before whom the case comes.\" 26. The Hon'ble Supreme Court further observed that the testimony of a solitary witness can be made the basis of conviction. The credibility of the witness is State v. Joginder Kumar U/s 279/338 IPC & 134/187 M V Act 10/12 FIR No. 305/10 PS Paschim Vihar required to be decided with reference to the quality of his evidence which must be free from blemish or suspicion and must impress the court as fact wholly truthful and so convincing that the court has no hesitation in recording a conviction solely on his uncorroborated testimony. 27. In case titled as \"Shadab @ Shamshad vs State of Govt. of NCT of Delhi\", Criminal Appeal 1377/2012 decided on 11.03.2014 it was held by the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi, \"There is no hard and fast rule that the testimony of injured requires corroboration before conviction. However, the rule of prudence has to be kept in mind. If the testimony of injured is trustworthy, categorically free of bias, and if there is nothing on record to suggest that the injured has any motive to falsely implicate the accused and allow his real assailants go scot free, the conviction can be based on the sole testimony of injured.\" 28. In the case at hand, the testimony of the sole eye witness / injured PW-1 has given a trustworthy and reliable account of the incident and defence has not been able to impeach his credibility in the cross examination. There is no reason to disbelieve the testimony of PW-1. Since his testimony has remained unimpeached, the court is of the view that no further corroboration is required. 29. In view of the above discussion, the court is of the view that the prosecution has successfully proved its case. It has been successfully proved by the prosecution that the accident was caused due to the rash and negligent driving by the accused and that the grievous injuries caused to PW-1 was a result of State v. Joginder Kumar U/s 279/338 IPC & 134/187 M V Act 11/12 FIR No. 305/10 PS Paschim Vihar such driving. It has also been proved that the accused did not provide medical aid to the injured and ran away after leaving him on the road. Hence, the accused is held guilty of the offence punishable u/s 279 & 338 Indian Penal Code and 134/187 Motor Vehicle Act. Accordingly, the accused stands convicted for offence under Section 279/338 Indian Penal Code & 134/187 Motor Vehicles Act. 30. Be listed arguments on point of sentence.

                "response-text": "Devender Vs. State 185(2011)DLT655, passed by High Court of Delhi, wherein, it is held that: 7.It is a wrong proposition that for any motor accident negligence of the driver should be presumed. An accident of such a nature as would prima facie show that it cannot be accounted to anything other than the negligence of the driver of vehicle may create a presumption and in such a case the driver has to explain how the accident happened without negligence on his part. Merely because a passenger fell down from the bus while boarding the bus no presumption of negligence can be drawn against the driver of the bus. 8.The principle of res ipsa loquitor is only a rule of evidence to determine the onus of proof in actions relating to negligence. The said principle has application only when the nature of the accident and the attending circumstances would reasonably lead to the belief that in the absence of negligence, the accident would not have occurred and that the thing which caused injury is shown to have been under the management and control of the alleged wrong doer 9. A rash act is primarily an over hasty act. It is opposed to a deliberate act. Still, a rash act can be a deliberate act in the sense that it was done without due care and caution. Culpable rashness lies in running the risk of doing an act with recklessness and with indifference as to the consequence. Criminal negligence is the failure to exercise duty with reasonable and proper care and precaution guarding against injury to the public generally or to Page no.11 of 13 FIR no.684/06 PS Narela U/s. 279/338 IPC State Vs. Mool Chand Saini any individual in particular. It is the imperative duty of the driver of a vehicle to adopt such reasonable and proper care and precaution. 19. Further, I would also like to emphasize on the judgment Ram Avtar Vs. State of Rajasthan, II (2006) ACC 438, passed by Rajasthan High Court wherein it is held that: Thus, the essential ingredients for offence under section 279 IPC is that the vehicle should be driven in \"rash and negligent manner\". The concept of rashness and negligence is borrowed from the law of tort into the criminal law. But in criminal law for rashness the criminality lies in running the risk of doing an act with recklessness or indifference to consequences. On the other hand, criminal negligence is the gross and culpable neglect or failure to exercise that reasonable and proper care and precaution to guard against injury either to the public generally or to the individual in particular, having regard to all the circumstances out of which the charge has arisen, it was the imperative duty of the accused person to have adopted (Ref. To AIR 1944 Lah. 163). Hence, the prosecution has to prove the existence of these two elements to bring home the offence under Section 279 IPC. However, the mere fact that accused was driving vehicle at high speed may not attract provision of Section 279 IPC. For, speed of the vehicle is not always determinative of the question whether vehicle was driven in a rash and negligent manner. One has to consider the surrounding circumstances of the case to conclude whether the driving was done in rash and negligent manner or not? 8.In the case of Badri Prasad Tiwari Vs. The State I (1994) ACC 476: 1994 Cri. LJ 389 (Qri.), the Hon'ble Orissa High Court has held that \"In order to constitute an offence under Section 279 IPC, it must be established that the accused was driving the vehicle on a public way in a rash and negligent manner to endanger human life or to likely Page no.12 of 13 FIR no.684/06 PS Narela U/s. 279/338 IPC State Vs. Mool Chand Saini cause hurt or injury to any other person."

It is the case of the prosecution that on 12.04.2012 at about 02.30 pm between red light of sector\u00ad3 & sector 13, Dwarka, New Delhi accused was driving a vehicle RTV bearing registration no. DL\u00ad1V\u00ad State Vs. Banarasi Dass Page no.1/5 FIR no. 73/12 7428 in rash and negligent manner and at a high speed so as to endanger human life and personal safety of others and while driving the above\u00adstated vehicle in above\u00adstated manner, the said vehicle had hit and injured one Parvez Kureshi and Khalil Kureshi who were traveling on a Scooter bearing no. DL\u00ad8SD\u00ad 7095 and cause injuries to both and thereby accused committed offences punishable U/s 279/337/338 IPC. 2. Charge sheet in the present case was filed under Section 279/337/338 IPC. Matter was compromised between both the injured and the accused and compensation was paid to the injured as agreed before the Mediation Cell. Statement of the parties were recorded and offence under Section 337 & 338 IPC were compounded with the permission of the court. 3. It is pertinent to note that the FIR was registered on the complaint which gives no description of how the vehicle was being driven rashly and negligently. Even otherwise, the injured has compounded the major offence disclosed in the charge sheet. In this background the fate of trial viz\u00ada\u00adviz Section 279 IPC is to be considered. An issue has been raised by the Ld. Counsel for the accused that this is a fit case for exercising power under Section 258 of Cr.P.C. for stopping the proceedings as nothing fruitful would be achieved. There is possibility of witnesses not deposing against the accused or turning hostile. I agree with the submissions of the Ld. Counsel. Even more relevant is that the asal tehrir and FIR are devoid of any description of the manner of accident. The exact manner in which the vehicle was being driven by the accused is not mentioned. Even State Vs. Banarasi Dass Page no.2/5 FIR no. 73/12 otherwise, Sections 279 and 337/338 of IPC punish rash and negligent act. The only difference is that in Section 279 IPC there is rashness and negligence which may result in injury and Section 337/ 338 IPC is invoked when such an act actually results in an injury being caused. Section 337/338 IPC has been made compoundable but Section 279 IPC is not compoundable. Perhaps, one reason is that, as far as Section 337/ 338 IPC are concerned, there is a determinable victim i.e. injured whereas in offence under Section 279 IPC, there is no determinable injured who can compound the offence. In a recent decision entitled as Adwait Surendra Aatre Vs. The State of Maharashtra & Ors., in Criminal Application no.124 of 2011, whereas Ld. Single Judge of Hon'ble High Court of Bombay held and I quote : \"...Therefore, there is an apprehension in the mind of both, the applicant / accused and complainant, that even by approaching the trial court, they may not be allowed compounding the entire proceeding because of inclusion of Section 279 IPC which is stated to be non\u00adcompoundable... 7. After minute reading of both these sections, it is seen that the alleged act of rash and neglient driving, endangering human life, is required to be proved as necessary ingredient to constitute offence under Section 279 IPC and by allegedly doing any act rashly or negligently as to endagering the human life are also the same ingredient to constitute the offence under Section 338 IPC. Therefore, such ingredients which are common, cannot be separately dealt with. The requirement of offence under Section 338 IPC is all that is covered in Section 279 of IPC. As specifically mentioned in the Code, when the offence under Section 338 IPC is compoundable, there cannot be any State Vs. Banarasi Dass Page no.3/5 FIR no. 73/12 impediment or bar to hold that the alleged offence under Section 279 of IPC read with Section 338 IPC could also be compounded. It is not a different act complained of to constitute a separate offence but are the essential ingredients of section 338 IPC in the present case. In short, the offence under Section 338 IPC is compoundable with permission of the Court, which, amounts to acquittal. After such compounding with the consent of 5 apl 124\u00ad11. ... the aggrieved party injured complainant, the accused cannot be prosecuted or tried for the same act which are complained of by different title or ead under Section 279 of IPC. Though it may not be a second trial, but hte accused, who is once acquitted from the charge under Section 338 IPC upon compounding of the charge based on thesame evidence, would be vexed, if he is directed to under go further trial under Section 279 for lesser punishment. Thus, by the present application, the applicant has made out a case for compoinding of offence... ...I am satisfied that once the offence under Section 338 IP is compounded, nothing survives for trying the offence under Section 279 IPC. The FIR or Charge sheet for additional Section 279 IPC would be meaningless when the cognizance is taken under Section 338 of IPC. The proceedings for the offence under Section 279 IPC, therefore deserves to be quashed and set aside.\" (Emphasis supplied) 4. Therefore, the Ld. Single Judge was of the view that once injury was received by rash and negligent driving, only Section 338 IPC ought to be invoked i.e. the graver of the two offences and Section 279 IPC is not made out, and therefore, the court quashed proceedings under Section 279 IPC and directed the parties to appear before Ld. Magistrate for compounding the offence under Section 279 IPC. State Vs. Banarasi Dass Page no.4/5 FIR no. 73/12 5. Ld. APP for State has submitted that the judgment is not laying down correct law and trial for offence under Section 279 IPC must be completed and power under Section 258 Cr.P.C., ought not to be exercised in the present case. 6. The court was also of the view that once offence under Section 338 IPC is compounded continuing the trial for the offence under Section 279 IPC shall be vexing the accused twice. Although, I am not fully in agreement with the view that Section 279 IPC looses its significance once Section 337/338 IPC are invoked by the police and that Section 337/338 IPC is not independent but only graver form of the offence under Section 279 IPC. Keeping in view the circumstances of the case, the decision of Bombay High Court and the futility of purpose in proceeding with the trial of minor offence when the major offence has already been compounded by the victim, I am of the view that present case is a fit case for exercising power under Section 258 Cr.P.C. I direct that the proceeding in the present case are stopped which shall operate as discharge of the accused as no witness as have been examined.

The contract of the lease amounting to Rs 7lakhs had a tenure of 3yrs which was completed on the 25th of Feb 2016. The owner however now states that she has no money to repay my lease amount and is asking me to wait until she finds another tenet to fill the house.       I have been pushing her for returning my money from the beginning of Feb, and she just keeps giving me different dates stating she'll return my money, but on the day, she come up with some reason to push the dates forward again. Unfortunately, the last time we spoke, she assured me that she will give me my money by the 15th of April and keeping that in mind, i took up another house for rent and have paid the new house owner the advance as well.       i got a new job about a year ago and have to travel 30 kms one way from this old house to get to my office, i had to rent a new place to make it more feasible for me to commute on a daily basis. This is the reason i looked and found a new place and even paid the advance thinking i will move in as soon as i get my money back.      My old owner now says nothing has come through and she can only pay me my money once she gets someone else in. i dont know how to proceed with this matter. I even tried telling her that i will file a case for legal action to be taken and she revolted back asking me to go ahead, she even threatened me stating that the case will go on for years and i'll never get my money back.       I'm in a very desperate situation, where my mother is unwell and had to go through an operation in Feb. I have borrowed money for the operation thinking that i will return it as soon as my money is given back to me by this lady. I'm paying interest on this loan that i've taken every month. I was being nice and dint want to create a scene, but this owner seems to be taking me for a ride.       THis owner is a widower, and a mother of 2 young boys. The elder one i think has dropped out of college and is not employed and the younger one is just going to step into college. She has no source of income for running her house. That being said, she owns 3 or 4 plots of land around and this house which has 2 floors. i live in the ground floor with my mother and brother, and she stays on the first floor. Let me bring to your notice, that although this lady is a widower, she is not subtle or approachable, she harasses us, shouts on top of her voice to make a point and is very abusive when i try to talk to her. She doesn't answer her phone calls when i try calling from my number and tries and avoids confrontation as much as she can.       I suggested her to take a loan against her properties or the house and give me my money, but unfortunately she says her properties are under some litigation and the house is on her father in law's name who is no more, so she cannot get a loan.       I'm in a very desperate situation, where i've taken loans, agreed on a new house for rent, and paying interest every month while my money is stuck with this landlady. I dont know how to go about this, sometime i feel like just givning everything up and killing myself. i want to know how can  i pursue getting my money back and solving all my problems.       Anyone who can help me deal with this, or suggest how i can go ahead please do drop me a mail on av4925@outlook.com or let me know how to contact you all i'll back.",

The effect of a judgment passed in a criminal proceeding on a pending civil proceeding is the question involved herein. It arises in the following factual matrix. Respondent borrowed a sum of Rs. 1,50,000/- (Rupees One Lakh Fifty Thousand Only) from the appellant herein on or about 10th August, 1999. On a demand having been made in that regard by the appellant, the respondent issued a cheque for the aforementioned sum on or about 20th October, 1999. The said cheque was presented by the appellant to the Oriental Bank of Commerce, Shahdra, Delhi, but the cheque was received back by the appellant with remarks `insufficient funds'. 3. A complaint petition was filed by the appellant against the respondent for alleged commission of offences under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code on [deleted]. He also filed a suit for recovery of a sum of Rs. 2,04,000/- on [deleted] in the Court of Senior Civil Judge at Delhi which was marked as Suit No. 253 of 2003. Both in the criminal as also in the civil proceedings the defence raised by the respondent was that she had not taken any loan from the appellant as alleged or at all. It was furthermore asserted that the cheque issued by her was not in respect of repayment of any loan, since no such loan had been taken. Respondent urged that the appellant had met her husband who was a property dealer in connection with some business who made a representation that pertaining to the same deal the police had to be bribed, whereafter on [deleted] the appellant accompanied by one Ms. Malhotra, retired ACP and his son came to the office of her husband and forcibly took the cheque in question from her husband since the cheque book was with him. 4. By reason of the Judgment dated [deleted], the learned Sessions Judge recorded a judgment of acquittal in favour of the respondent holding that he had successfully proved that the cheque in question was not issued to the complainant by way of repayment of any loan. 2 5. Respondent thereafter during the pendency of the trial suit filed an application in the said civil suit purported to be under Order 7 Rule 11(d) read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure for rejection of the plaint on the ground that the criminal complaint had already been dismissed. The learned Civil Judge dismissed the said application inter alia opining that the findings of a criminal court in the proceeding under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act would not operate as `res judicata' in the civil suit for recovery of money as the nature of proceeding in both the cases was different. 6. Respondent approached the High Court in a writ petition questioning the order of dismissal of the said application and praying inter alia for the following reliefs: (a) To set aside and quash the impugned order dated 17.3.2007 passed by the Hon'ble Court of Shri Shailender Malik, Civil Judge, Delhi in Suit No. 356/06/02 titled as \"Vishnu Dutt Sharma v. Daya Sapra; and (2) Pass such other further orders as this Hon'ble Court deems just and proper in the facts and circumstances of the matter. 7. By reason of the impugned Judgment the High Court allowed the said writ petition. The High Court in arriving at its finding applied the principles of res-judicata. It also opined that the suit filed by the appellant was nothing but an abuse of the process of law. 8. Mr. J.M. Kalia, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant would contend that the High Court committed a serious error in passing the impugned judgment in so far as it failed to take into consideration that the principle of res-judicata is not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the case. 9. The learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent, on the other hand, would urge that having regard to the fact that both in the civil as also in the criminal proceeding, the burden was on the defendant-accused and he having successfully discharged the same, the appellant could not have been allowed to continue the civil proceedings in view of the judgment rendered by the criminal court. The plaint was, on the said premise, directed to be rejected. 10. Order 7 Rule 11(d) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (for short, \"Code\") provides for rejection of a plaint inter alia on the premise the suit was barred by any statute. Such an embargo in the maintainability of the suit must be apparent from the averments made in the plaint. 11. There cannot be any doubt or dispute that a creditor can maintain a civil and criminal proceeding at the same time. Both the proceeding, thus, can run parallely. The fact required to be proved for obtaining a decree in the civil suit and a judgment of conviction in the criminal proceedings may be overlapping but the standard of proof in a criminal case vis-a-vis a civil suit, indisputably is different. Whereas in a criminal case the prosecution is bound to prove the commission of the offence on the part of the accused beyond any reasonable doubt; in a civil suit `preponderance of probability' would serve the purpose for obtaining a decree. 12. Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act provides that dishonour of a cheque subject to fulfillment of condition precedent as laid down in the proviso appended thereto is a cognizable offence. 13. The cause of action for institution of the civil suit was grant of loan whereas that of the criminal case was return of a cheque inter alia on the premise that the account of the accused was insufficient to honour it or that it exceeded the amount arranged to be paid from that account by an agreement with the bank. 14. Section 138 of the Act contains a non-obstante clause. 3 In terms of Section 139 of the Act, a presumption in favour of the holder of the cheque may be raised that he had received the cheque of the nature referred to in Section 138 for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability. Section 118 occurring in Chapter XIII of the Act provides for special rules of evidence; Clause (a) whereof reads as under: 118. Presumptions as to negotiable instruments.- Until the contrary is proved, the following presumptions shall be made: (a) of consideration.--that every negotiable instrument was made or drawn for consideration, and that every such instrument, when it has been accepted, indorsed, negotiated or transferred, was accepted, indorsed, negotiated or transferred for consideration. Proviso appended thereto reads as under: Provided that, where the instrument has been obtained from its lawful owner, or from any person in lawful custody thereof, by means of an offence or fraud, or has been obtained from the maker or acceptor therof by means of an offence or fraud, or for unlawful consideration, the burden of proving that the holder is a holder in due course lies upon him. 15. What would be the effect of a judgment passed in the criminal proceedings in relation to the subject matter for which a civil proceedings has also been initiated is the question. 16. In a criminal proceeding, although upon discharge of initial burden by the complainant, the burden of proof may shift on an accused, the court must apply the principles of `presumption of innocence as a human right'. The statutory provisions containing the doctrine of reverse burden must therefore be construed strictly. Whereas a provision containing reverse burden on an accused would be construed strictly and subject to the strict proof of the foundational fact by the complainant, in a civil proceeding no such restriction can be imposed. Application of Section 118(a) and 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act on the touchstone of the principles of presumption of innocence fell for consideration before this Court in Krishna Janardhan Bhat v. Dattatraya G. Hegde reported in MANU/SC/0503/2008 : 2008CriLJ1172 wherein it was categorically held: 19. Indisputably, a mandatory presumption is required to be raised in terms of Section 118(b) and Section 139 of the Act. Section 13(1) of the Act defines 'negotiable instrument' to mean \"a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque payable either to order or to bearer\". Section 138 of the Act has three ingredients, viz.: (i) that there is a legally enforceable debt; (ii) that the cheque was drawn from the account of bank for discharge in whole or in part of any debt or other liability which presupposes a legally enforceable debt; and (iii) that the cheque so issued had been returned due to insufficiency of funds. 20. The proviso appended to the said section provides for compliance of legal requirements before a complaint petition can be acted upon by a court of law. Section 139 of the Act merely raises a presumption in regard to the second aspect of the matter. Existence of legally recoverable debt is not a matter of presumption under Section 139 of the Act. It merely raises a presumption in favour of a holder of the cheque that the same has been issued for discharge of any debt or other liability. 4 21. The courts below, as noticed hereinbefore, proceeded on the basis that Section 139 raises a presumption in regard to existence of a debt also. The courts below, in our opinion, committed a serious error in proceeding on the basis that for proving the defence the accused is required to step into the witness box and unless he does so he would not be discharging his burden. Such an approach on the part of the courts, we feel, is not correct. 22. An accused for discharging the burden of proof placed upon him under a statute need not examine himself. He may discharge his burden on the basis of the materials already brought on records. An accused has a constitutional right to maintain silence. Standard of proof on the part of an accused and that of the prosecution in a criminal case is different. Noticing the decision of this Court in Bharat Barrel & Drum Manufacturing Company v. Amin Chand Payrelal reported in MANU/SC/0123/1999 : [1999]1SCR704 , this Court held: 24. Furthermore, whereas prosecution must prove the guilt of an accused beyond all reasonable doubt, the standard of proof so as to prove a defence on the part of an accused is 'preponderance of probabilities'. Inference of preponderance of probabilities can be drawn not only from the materials brought on records by the parties but also by reference to the circumstances upon which he relies. 25. A statutory presumption has an evidentiary value. The question as to whether the presumption whether stood rebutted or not, must, therefore, be determined keeping in view the other evidences on record. For the said purpose, stepping into the witness box by the appellant is not imperative. In a case of this nature, where the chances of false implication cannot be ruled out, the background fact and the conduct of the parties together with their legal requirements are required to be taken into consideration. 17. As regards the purpose of introduction of reverse burden in Section 139 of the Act, this Court observed: 33. We are not oblivious of the fact that the said provision has been inserted to regulate the growing business, trade, commerce and industrial activities of the country and the strict liability to promote greater vigilance in financial matters and to safeguard the faith of the creditor in the drawer of the cheque which is essential to the economic life of a developing country like India. This, however, shall not mean that the courts shall put a blind eye to the ground realities. Statute mandates raising of presumption but it stops at that. It does not say how presumption drawn should be held to have rebutted. Other important principles of legal jurisprudence, namely presumption of innocence as human rights and the doctrine of reverse burden introduced by Section 139 should be delicately balanced. Such balancing acts, indisputably would largely depend upon the factual matrix of each case, the materials brought on record and having regard to legal principles governing the same. 18. The said dicta was followed by this Court in Noor Aga v. State of Punjab reported in MANU/SC/2913/2008 :2008 (9) SCALE 68 wherein it was noticed: 58. In Glanville Williams, Textbook of Criminal Law (2nd Edn.) page 56, it is stated: Harking back to Woolmington, it will be remembered that Viscount Sankey said that \"it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the prisoner's guilt, subject to the defence of insanity and subject also to any statutory exception\".... Many statutes shift the persuasive burden. It has become a matter of routine for Parliament, in respect of the most trivial offences as well as some serious ones, to enact that the onus of proving a particular fact shall rest on the defendant, so that he can be convicted \"unless he proves\" it. 59. But then the decisions rendered in different jurisdictions are replete with cases where validity of the provisions raising a presumption against an accused, has been upheld. Noticing the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms as also International Convention on Civil and 5 Political Rights and consequent change in the approach in some of the courts, it was opined that limited inroads on presumption would be justified. Noticing that even applicability of doctrine of res ipsa loquitur may not be applicable in a criminal proceeding, it was held that the trial must be fair and the accused must be provided with opportunities to effectively defend himself. The court held: 88. Placing persuasive burden on the accused persons must justify the loss of protection which will be suffered by the accused. Fairness and reasonableness of trial as also maintenance of the individual dignity of the accused must be uppermost in the court's mind. 19. Reverse burden or evidentiary burden on an accused, thus, would require strict interpretation and application. However, in a civil suit such strict compliance may not be insisted upon. If that be so, it may not be correct to contend that a judgment rendered in criminal proceeding would make continuation of a civil proceeding an abuse of the process of court. 20. Any person may as of right have access to the courts of justice. Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure enables him to file a suit of civil nature excepting those, the cognizance whereof is expressly or by necessary implication barred. 21. Order 7 Rule 11(d) is one of such provision which provides for rejection of plaint, if it is barred by any law. Order 7 Rule 11(d) of the Code being one of the exceptions, thus, must be strictly construed. 22. This leads us to another question namely whether the civil suit was barred on the day on which it was filed. Answer to the said question indisputably must be rendered in the negative. If as on the date of institution of the suit, the plaint could not be rejected in terms of Order 7 Rule 11(d) of the Code of Civil Procedure; whether its continuation would attract the principles of abuse of processes of court only because the accused was acquitted in the criminal proceeding is the question. 23. Dismissal of a suit on the ground that it attracts the provisions of Section 12 of the Code, keeping in view of the content of provisions of Section 11 thereof may now be considered. The principle of resjudicata as contained in Section 11 of the Code is not attracted in this case. Even general principle of resjudicata would also not be attracted. A suit cannot be held to be barred only because the principle of estoppel subject to requisite pleading and proof may be applied. The said principle may not be held to be applicable only at a later stage of the suit. It brings us to the question as to whether previous judgment of a criminal proceeding would be relevant in a suit. 24. Section 40 of the Evidence Act reads as under: Previous judgments relevant to bar a second suit or trial. - The existence of any judgment, order or decree which by law prevents any Courts from taking Cognizance of a suit or holding a trial is a relevant fact when the question is whether such Court ought to take cognizance of such suit or to hold such trial. This principle would, therefore, be applicable, inter alia, if the suit is found to be barred by the principle of res judicata or by reason of the provisions of any other statute. 25. It does not lay down that a judgment of the criminal court would be admissible in the civil court for its relevance is limited. {See Seth Ramdayal Jat v. Laxmi Prasad MANU/SC/0582/2009 : 2009(5)SCALE527 }. 6 The judgment of a criminal court in a civil proceeding will only have limited application, viz., inter alia, for the purpose as to who was the accused and what was the result of the criminal proceedings. 26. Any finding in a criminal proceeding by no stretch of imagination would be binding in a civil proceeding. In M.S. Sheriff and Anr. v. State of Madras and Ors. MANU/SC/0055/1954 : [1954]1SCR1144 , a Constitution Bench of this Court was seized with a question as to whether a civil suit or a criminal case should be stayed in the event both are pending. It was opined that the criminal matter should be given precedence. In regard to the possibility of conflict in decisions, it was held that the law envisages such an eventuality when it expressly refrains from making the decision of one Court binding on the other, or even relevant, except for certain limited purposes, such as sentence or damages. It was held that the only relevant consideration was the likelihood of embarrassment. 27. If a primacy is given to a criminal proceeding, indisputably, the civil suit must be determined on its own keeping in view the evidence which has been brought on record before it and not in terms of the evidence brought in the criminal proceeding. The question came up for consideration in K.G. Premshanker v. Inspector of Police and Anr. MANU/SC/0771/2002 : 2002CriLJ4343 , wherein this Court inter alia held: 30. What emerges from the aforesaid discussion is -- (1) the previous judgment which is final can be relied upon as provided under Sections 40 to 43 of the Evidence Act; (2) in civil suits between the same parties, principle of res judicata may apply; (3) in a criminal case, Section 300 CrPC makes provision that once a person is convicted or acquitted, he may not be tried again for the same offence if the conditions mentioned therein are satisfied; (4) if the criminal case and the civil proceedings are for the same cause, judgment of the civil court would be relevant if conditions of any of Sections 40 to 43 are satisfied, but it cannot be said that the same would be conclusive except as provided in Section 41. Section 41 provides which judgment would be conclusive proof of what is stated therein. 31. Further, the judgment, order or decree passed in a previous civil proceeding, if relevant, as provided under Sections 40 and 42 or other provisions of the Evidence Act then in each case, the court has to decide to what extent it is binding or conclusive with regard to the matter(s) decided therein. Take for illustration, in a case of alleged trespass by A on B's property, B filed a suit for declaration of its title and to recover possession from A and suit is decreed. Thereafter, in a criminal prosecution by B against A for trespass, judgment passed between the parties in civil proceedings would be relevant and the court may hold that it conclusively establishes the title as well as possession of B over the property. In such case, A may be convicted for trespass. The illustration to Section 42 which is quoted above makes the position clear. Hence, in each and every case, the first question which would require consideration is -- whether judgment, order or decree is relevant, if relevant -- its effect. It may be relevant for a limited purpose, such as, motive or as a fact in issue. This would depend upon the facts of each case. It is, however, significant to notice a decision of this Court in Karam Chand Ganga Prasad and Anr. etc. v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/0058/1970 : 1971CriLJ1072 , wherein it was categorically held that the decisions of the civil court will be binding on the criminal courts but the converse is not true, was overruled therein, stating: 33. Hence, the observation made by this Court in V.M. Shah case that the finding recorded by the criminal court stands superseded by the finding recorded by the civil court is not correct enunciation of law. Further, the general observations made in Karam Chand case are in context of the facts of the case stated above. The Court was not required to consider the earlier decision of the Constitution Bench in M.S. Sheriff case as well as Sections 40 to 43 of the Evidence Act. 7 28. Sections 42 & 43 of the Evidence Act providing for the relevance of other decrees, order and judgment read as under: 42. Relevancy and effect of judgment, order or decrees, other than those mentioned in Section 41. - Judgments, orders or decrees other than those mentioned in Section 41, are relevant if they relate to matters of a public nature relevant to the inquiry; nut such judgments, orders or decrees are not conclusive proof of that which they state. 43. Judgments, etc., other than those mentioned in Sections 40, 41 and 42, when relevant - Judgments, orders or decrees other then those mentioned in Sections 40, 41 and 42 are irrelevant, unless the existence of such judgment, order or decree, is a fact in issue, or is relevant, under some other provision of this Act. 29. If judgment of a civil court is not binding on a criminal court, it is incomprehensible that a judgment of a criminal court will be binding on a civil court. We have noticed hereinbefore that Section 43 of the Evidence Act categorically states that judgments, orders or decrees, other than those mentioned in Sections 40, 41 and 42 are irrelevant, unless the existence of such judgment, order or decree, is a fact in issue, or is relevant in some other provisions of the Act, no other provisions of the Evidence Act or for that matter any other statute had been brought to our notice. 30. Another Constitution Bench of this Court had the occasion to consider the question in Iqbal Singh Marwah and Anr. v. Meenakshi Marwah and Anr. MANU/SC/0197/2005 : 2005CriLJ2161 . Relying on M.S. Sheriff (supra) as also various other decisions, it was categorically held: 32. Coming to the last contention that an effort should be made to avoid conflict of findings between the civil and criminal courts, it is necessary to point out that the standard of proof required in the two proceedings are entirely different. Civil cases are decided on the basis of preponderance of evidence while in a criminal case the entire burden lies on the prosecution and proof beyond reasonable doubt has to be given. 31. The question yet again came up for consideration in P. Swaroopa Rani v. M. Hari Narayana @ Hari Babu MANU/SC/7280/2008 : AIR2008SC1884 , wherein it was categorically held: 13. It is, however, well-settled that in a given case, civil proceedings and criminal proceedings can proceed simultaneously. Whether civil proceedings or criminal proceedings shall be stayed depends upon the fact and circumstances of each case. 32. In view of these authoritative pronouncements, we have no doubt in our mind that principles of res judicata are not applicable in the facts and circumstances of this case. 33. The impugned judgment cannot be sustained. It is set aside accordingly. The appeal is allowed. However, in the facts and circumstances of this case, there shall be no order as to co"

                "response-text": "Dear Sir, It can be possible if the Registering authority is managed. The law on gifts is as follows: ========================================================================================= Gift Deed \u2013 once registred no cancellation A gift is a money or house, shares, jewellery, etc. that is received without thought, or merely an asset acquired without making a payment against it and is a capital asset for the \u2018Recipient.\u2019 It can be as cash or movable property or immovable property. If you might want to gift the property to any of your blood relatives, Gift deed can be used. In the case of immovable property, it is required to register the Gift Deed as per Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908. This kind of transfer is unavoidable. When you gift the assets like land, it belongs to the beneficiary or receiver of the gift and you cannot switch the transfer or even ask money related compensation. It can be a cost effective method of transferring the ownership. 3. Relinquishment Deed or Release Deed If there are multiple owners of assets, and if one of the co-owner needs to transfer his/her rights in the property to another co-owner then this can be possibly done through the execution of RELINQUISHMENT DEED. The property transfer through Relinquishment deed can be for consideration or without consideration i.e. without any exchange of money. Like gift deed, this transfer is also unavoidable. 4. Partition Deed or Settlement Deed Partition Deed is executed by the co-owners of the land when a court order or order of a local revenue authority has to be implemented. In the case of Settlement Deed, however, the property is owned by a third person and is settled for individuals who do not have any past interest in the said property and the share of the heir is as per the desires of the settler. Unlike WILL, Settlement is a non-testamentary report which becomes operative immediately. Will is a testamentary file, which becomes operative after the expiration of its owner. Also, WILL is revocable and can be modified by the testator, whereas Settlement deed is unalterable. ========================================== Section 17 in The Registration Act, 1908 17. Documents of which registration is compulsory.\u2014(l) The following documents shall be registered, if the property to which they relate is situate in a district in which, and if they have been executed on or after the date on which, Act No. XVI of 1864, or the Indian Registration Act, 1866, or the Indian Registration Act, 1871, or the Indian Registration Act, 1877, or this Act came or comes into force, namely:\u2014 (a) instruments of gift of immovable property; Section 126 in The Transfer of Property Act, 1882 126. When gift may be suspended or revoked.\u2014The donor and donee may agree that on the happening of any specified event which does not depend on the will of the donor a gift shall be suspended or revoked; but a gift which the parties agree shall be revocable wholly or in part, at the mere will of the donor, is void wholly or in part, as the case may be. A gift may also be revoked in any of the cases (save want or failure of consideration) in which, if it were a contract, it might be rescinded. Save as aforesaid, a gift cannot be revoked. Nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to affect the rights of transferees for consideration without notice. Illustrations (a) A gives a field to B, reserving to himself, with B\u2019s assent, the right to take back the field in case B and his descendants die before A. B dies without descendants in A\u2019s lifetime. A may take back the field. (b) A gives a lakh of rupees to B, reserving to himself, with B\u2019s assent, the right to take back at pleasure Rs. 10,000 out of the lakh. The gift holds goods as to Rs. 90,000, but is void as to Rs. 10,000, which continue to belong to A. No Authority Can Cancel Registered Documents: SC [Read Judgment]  The Supreme Court in Satya Pal Anand vs. State of M.P, has held that once the document is registered, it is not open to any authority, under the Registration Act, 1908, to cancel the registration. In the instant case, an application was moved by a person before the Sub-Registrar (Registration) calling upon him to cancel the registration of extinguishment deed executed by the Society cancelling an allotment of plot. Aggrieved by rejection of his application, on the ground that Sub Registrar has no jurisdiction to cancel the registration of a registered document in question, he approached Inspector General (Registration), but in vain.... =========================================== Essential Elements Of Gift The term gift denotes a voluntary transfer of real or personal property to another made without any particular cause and without consideration. The person who gives the gift is called donor and the one who receives the gift is called donee. A gift is generally made out of affection, respect, charity, or like impulses, and not from any moral or legal duty. Gifts enjoy tax exemption and a payment made without conditions and out of respect or charity or in anticipation of economic benefits is generally characterized as gift under tax law. A charity will normally issue a tax receipt for the gift amount and it can provide a tax receipt for gift- in -kind also.  A gift can be made during the donor\u2019s lifetime (inter-vivos) or by will (testamentary). The two principal categories of gifts are inter vivos gifts and causa mortis gifts. An inter vivos gift is perfected and takes effect during the lifetime of the donor and donee and is irrevocable in nature. A gift causa mortis is one that is made in anticipation of imminent death. This type of gift takes effect upon the death of the donor from the expected disease or illness and may be revoked until the donor\u2019s death. There is a third category called testamentary gift made by will. It operates to transfer ownership only subsequent to the death of the donor. Essential elements of a gift include: capacity of the donor; intention of the donor to make the gift; completed delivery to or for the benefit of the donee; and acceptance of the gift by the donee. A gift can be made either in the form of cash or a gift-in-kind. A gift-in-kind means a gift of property other than cash and includes inventory, capital property, donations of real estate, stocks and bonds, and personal items. A donor can make a gift to a registered charity or other qualified donee. Services are not property and hence will not constitute the subject matter of gifts. Gift should be given voluntarily, of one\u2019s free will and the donor who makes the gift should transfer the full ownership and possession to the donee. Generally a donor transfers property as a gift without expecting anything in return and donor cannot part with the gifted property in the name of a contract or court order. The three elements which are essential to the making of a valid gift are delivery, donative intent, and acceptance by the donee. The delivery of a gift is complete when it is made directly to the donee. Delivery can also be made to a third party on behalf of the donee. The third person can be the donor\u2019s agent, bailee, or trustee. In the case of delivery to a third party, delivery is deemed to be complete only when such person actually hands over the property to the donee. A delivery may be actual, implied, or symbolic, and requires some affirmative act to take place. For instance, A wishes to gift a cow to his daughter B. The actual delivery takes place when A hires a person to bring the cow to B\u2019s farm. A symbolic delivery of a car, for instance can occur when the donor hands over the key of the car to the donee. Delivery is complete only when the donor surrenders control of the property. For example, an individual who expresses the desire to make a gift of a car to another but continues to drive the car whenever he or she wishes has not surrendered control of the car. If the donor and donee reside in the same house, the gift need not be removed from the house and can be kept in the same house. States do not require too many formalities to establish delivery and if it is proved that the donor relinquished all claim to the gift and recognized the donee\u2019s right to exercise control over it, courts consider it as an adequate indication of a transfer by gift. In the case of a gift to an infant or an insane person who does not have legal capacity to accept delivery, such delivery can be made to an individual who will hold it for such infant or insane person. If the donee is out of the country at the time of making the gift, delivery can be made to someone else who agrees to accept the property for the donee. However, if the individual accepting delivery is employed by the donor, it is presumed that the donor has not rendered control of the property and that delivery has not actually been made. \u201cThe individual accepting delivery must be holding the property for the donee and not for the donor.\u201d The second ingredient of a valid gift is donative intent, which is inferred from the \u201cdonor\u2019s words, the surrounding circumstances, the relationship of the parties, the size of the gift in relation to the amount of the donor\u2019s property as a whole, and the behavior of the donor towards the property subsequent to the purported gift.\u201d The intent must be present at the time the gift is made and is different from a mere expectation. For example, if one person promises to give a house to an artist \u201csomeday,\u201d the promise is unenforceable because there is no intent to make an effective gift at the time of the promise. The third element for a valid gift is acceptance. Acceptance means that the donee unconditionally agrees to take the gift. It is necessary for the donee to agree at the same time the delivery is made. The gift can, however, be revoked at any time prior to acceptance."

The conditions what they have mentioned ion the legal notice  are not enforceable in law if they decide to approach court of law for this purpose. When we see the Indian legal scenario about the non compete clause, it is prohibited under the Law of Contracts. Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act-1872 provides that \u201dEvery agreement by which anyone is restrained from exercising a lawful profession or trade or business of any kind, is to that extent void\u201d Non-compete provisions for the term of employment are not regarded 'restrictive covenants' under Indian law. However, having such provisions applicable after a person leaves the organisation is against the Indian Contract Act, and, therefore, not enforceable. Typically, the only way to fight a non-compete agreement is to go to court. If you are an employee (or former employee) who signed such an agreement, this means you must violate the agreement and wait to be sued. It may be that your former employer has never sued another employee to enforce the non-compete agreement. There are tough laws that restrict the scope of non-compete agreements, and judges are reluctant to enforce them \u2013 which makes it less difficult for you to get out of a non-compete agreement you signed. Indian law is therefore very clear and strict on this point, any such non compete agreement shall not be binding on the parties and the same shall be null and void. By using the term void ab initio, for such type of agreements it has shown that it has kept such non compete clause in the agreements beyond consideration. Indian courts have also consistently refused to enforce post termination non compete clauses in employment contracts as \u201crestraint of trade\u201d is impermissible under section 27 of the Indian Contract Act-1872, and have held them as void and against the public policy because of their potential to deprive an individual of his or her fundamental right to earn a living. Thus you need not be worried about this aspect, let them take action as per their own understanding of law, you can very well defend your interests and get out of it very easily."

Six Months Waiting Period In Section 13B(2) Of Hindu Marriage Act For Divorce By Mutual Consent Not Mandatory: SC [Read Judgment]...(Please write on my e-mail for judgment) In case of Divorce also Six month outer limit is provided under law: \u201cSection 21-B of the Hindu Marriage Act provides for an expeditious trial \u2014 to be concluded within a period of six months. However, the disposal of petitions before the trial courts take many years,\u201d the court said. ===================================================================================== It is in the hands of LITIGANTS how early they wish to conclude, it may be a request or by approaching the High Court ......For your kind information the relevant news its are below. Hope you will appreciate this information and award me fifth rank.. ==================================================================================== Law deadline 60 days, cases stretch for years AHMEDABAD: A resident of Shahpur , Shabanabanu Shaikh , filed a case in January 2009 under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, against her husband Mushtaq Shaikh . The protection officer submitted the 'domestic incident report' within two weeks. The court concerned began proceedings \u2014 which the law stipulates must be concluded in 60 days \u2014 but has not yet taken any decision on her application for maintenance. The next hearing is scheduled for November 26. The case of Bapunagar's Farzana Saiyed is no different. She too had filed in 2009 an application for maintenance against her husband and for shelter at her in-laws' house. Five years later, she is a widow and her case is still pending. Most of the cases filed under the domestic violence law follow this grim pattern. It is the section 12 of the Domestic Violence Act which lays down the proviso that a magistrate will endeavor to dispose of every application within 60 days from the date of the first hearing. But that deadline is seldom maintained. In fact, Dinesh Sharma, an advocate, says: \"There is not a single instance of a domestic violence case, in my knowledge, that was completed within two months in city courts, unless the quarreling parties reached a compromise.\" Sharma says the format to be adopted by courts for these cases comes from the Criminal Procedure Code. \"And criminal lawyers know ways to defer such proceedings,\" he says. Another advocate, Imtiyaz Pathan, says that courts deal with DV cases in the same manner as they would handle other criminal cases. \"There are some magistrates who give adjournments of more than three months in proceedings,\" he says. The delay in court proceedings is the result of grave deficiencies in human and infrastructural resources to deal with women's complaints of domestic violence. Kashmira Kapadia is the only protection officer in Ahmedabad district, which receives more than 1,000 complaints every year. \"Ideally there should be six protection officers in this district to expedite the processing of domestic violence complaints,\" she says. Earlier, based on a TOI report, the Gujarat high court had taken suo motu cognizance of the issue and had ordered the state government, on February 22 last year, to fill vacancies and create infrastructure in protection officers' offices across the state. The vacancies are yet to be filled. Times View The Domestic Violence law makes it incumbent on magistrates to settle a case in 60 days. The reality is that often adjournments of two months are won by defence lawyers. This is a travesty of the law, especially since it lays down a deadline unambiguously. The law was created to offer speedy redress. So domestic violence cases should not be treated like any other litigation. ===================================================================================== High Court wants divorce cases disposed of in 6 months Directs trial courts to ensure speedier granting of alimony and maintenance to the \u2018weaker spouse\u2019. Taking note of the undue delay in granting maintenance and alimony in divorce cases under the Hindu Marriage Act, the Delhi High Court has directed the lower courts to ensure that the trial in the matrimonial dispute cases be completed within six months as prescribed by the Act. \u201cNo standard uniform practice and procedure is followed by the courts,\u201d noted the court of Justice JR Midha, adding that in most cases, the provisions for interim maintenance and permanent alimony under Section 24 and 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act were not being utilised. \u201cSection 21-B of the Hindu Marriage Act provides for an expeditious trial \u2014 to be concluded within a period of six months. However, the disposal of petitions before the trial courts take many years,\u201d the court said. \u201cThis is matter of serious concern. It was certainly not the intention of the law that parties to a dissolved marriage suffer further misery of starvation in the absence of grant of alimony,\u201d the court said. Observing that most people resorted to \u201cparallel proceedings\u201d under the better known maintenance provisions under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure code, the court noted that parallel proceedings took more time and deprived the weaker spouse of maintenance. The maintenance provisions under the Hindu Marriage Act apply to both spouses, meaning that the husband can also claim maintenance from wife at the time of divorce in case it is proved that he does not have sufficient income or assets.The directions have been issue after the court decided to hear nine separate pleas for maintenance filed by women whose husbands had filed for divorce. The court noted that the disposal of cases had taken a long time, with the oldest of the nine cases dating back to 1996. The court in its order has now directed that the spouse who files for divorce is required to file his or her affidavits with details of income, assets and expenditure, as required by Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, at the same time as the divorce plea, if they want to claim maintenance. The respondent party should also file their affidavits within 30 days of the notice being issued, the court said. Further, in order to protect the spouse who is the respondent in divorce proceedings, and is usually the party which claims maintenance, the court has said lower courts could consider directing the petitioner to deposit money to be paid to the respondent as litigation expenses. The court has also prescribed that the affidavit and counter affidavit on income must be filed within six weeks of notice being issued on a divorce petition. \u201cIf the disposal of maintenance application is taking time, and the delay is causing hardship, some ad interim maintenance should be granted to the claimant spouse,\u201d the court said. The court also said the time-table prescribed should be followed for all cases of maintenance under the Hindu Marriage Act, Domestic Violence Act, Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act as well as pleas under Section 125 CrPC. The district courts have also been asked to file a report on the implementation of the time-table and on whether the suggestions have curbed the delay in matrimonial cases. Divorce by Mutual Consent Step by Step Procedure  http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/marriage-divorce-does-mutual-consent-matter/ Hindus: Under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act, a husband and wife can file a mutual divorce only when they have lived apart for at least a year. The couple must jointly mention about inability to continue the marital relationship due to some unavoidable circumstances. Both the sides must voluntarily agree to dissolve the marriage. The filing of a mutual divorce by both the husband and the wife is termed as \u0091the first motion\u0092. A couple can file for a second motion after a gap of six months. This time span is provided to the couple so that they get time to reconsider their marriage. A divorce decree can be passed before the completion of the six months term if all the mandatory requirements are sufficed. If the divorce file is not withdrawn within 18 months,the court passes a divorce decree. In case one of the sides withdraws the petition,the court initiates to make an enquiry. If the concerned side disagrees to give the consent,the court holds no right to pass the judgment."

Before booking of above flat HDFC officers had confirmed me verbally that HDFC is providing home loan for this project ( some of the loans of other customers were sanctioned earlier ). Builders had failed to give the possession in time limit & denying to refund the money back. Through RTI it has been confirmed that the builders has constructed the project against the sanctioned plan which was later got compounded from local development authority. But it is revealed that my flat for which loan was sanctioned, was does not exist in the first approved plan thus was an illegal construction before compounding & my loan, as well as loan of some other customers, was sanctioned before compounding i.e on unapproved plan. Means builder had submitted the fake documents & false statement. to bank which bank does not verified, there seems a nexus between bank officials & builder. HDFC has denied to provide approved plan submitted by builder with them. Complaint has been registered with bank at all platforms i.e. on Bank's portal, their facebook account, E-mail, but they are not replying or responding. I had lodged my complaint against the builder to Govt bodies.    Now I wants guidance that...   Q 1. What action / steps should I take against the bank.   Q 2. Stoping of payment of EMI of bank, with or without communicating to bank is justified & as per law.   Q3 Shall I go to consumer court against bank",

My neighbour has encroached on my land and the matter is pending in Delhi High Court.      2. In the month of February, my neighbour attacked me and a case is pending against him under SC ST Act in the Court because grevious hurt was caused to me. He also damaged my property.      3. In the month of March I procured a stay order from the lower court so that he does not construct anything on my property.      4. In the month of May, he again broke my wall which is clearly contempt of court and a criminal case under SC ST ACT i.e. damaging a property.      5. When I approached the police at the time he was breaking my wall. the police officials refused to stop him and contented that matter is going on in the court and they would not do anything. As a result my neighbour broke the wall and the police officials allowed the illegal act of breaking the wall.      6. I moved to court and the court directed the police to take cognizance of the stay order. but for me to get the direction of court took 2 months and meanwhile my neighbour has completed what he wanted to do.      Queries.      1. Since my neighbour again broke my property, the matter is clearly criminal and violated the SC ST Act again apart from being a contempt of court stay order. Can a fresh case be filed or should I inform the court in SC ST case about him breaking the wall and ask for strict action against the police for allowing the illegal act and against my neighbour for again damaging my wall. (please mention section and case)      2. My neighbour was given bail under notice under Section 44 (something sub section) wherein if he again does anything illegal then the bail be cancelled. Here my query is does breaking my wall and violating the stay order being a civil case be a cause for cancelling of his bail in the ST atrocity case as well.      3. the Police time and again are refusing to take action saying that the matter is in court and in this garb they are allowing all the illegal act to me and my property. what do i do to get the police officials work and protect my interest over property and person.",

        "query-text": "Dear Advocates,       This is regarding a case wherein a joint property (purchased by my grandfather and remains undivided after he deceased till date) is been sold by one of my relative (Cousin Brother- his share) on his own without informing the other family members.    This cousin further kept taking some money initially and subsequently kept on receiving money (as a monthly instalment) every month. Overall he has received part in cash a few as cheque payments towards an agreed value which is 35% of the total decided value. My cousin also handed over the original agreements of the property to this fraudulent purchaser.    This purchaser now sometimes hands over money to this cousin by cheque. My Cousin had got married few years back. His wife and he are not on good terms and now she is asking him to give her share from this ancestral joint property. The investor sometimes gives money to her too.    This purchaser has not taken possession of the house and some land along with it. Neither do we or anyone stay as the house is now damaged and not fit for use. Electricity is cut off.       The agreement is made on a 100 rs stamp paper with a Notary stamp and not in a gram panchayat office. Also it is not mentioned exact in how many instalment\u2019s will be the pending amount paid.    My question:   We understand, this is a practice in villages and rural areas to put an advance for a property to one of the co-owners and eventually keep it hanging ultimately making it difficult for the owners who ultimately have to sell them to these purchasers.   My question,   As it\u2019s clear, this transaction is not complete until all the relatives agree and sign on an agreement;   What is the intent of this purchase mentioned about, if all the relatives have not agreed, what this person will gain by giving money only to one of the relative as in fact he is locking his money which will be futile unless we all agree to sell him.    As original property papers are now in the investor\u2019s possession, what can we do? Can we sell it to someone else?   Is there any unique way to handle this?    Note: The cousin is now in good terms with us now and understood his mistake and is now with us for support. In fact we support him financially for his living      best Regards,",

        "query-text": "I am currently working with an MNC in USA.    I was married in November, 2014 in India. I moved to US in June, 2015.   My wife joined me there in September, 2015.      After a few days itself she started quarreling with me over various issues. These issues ranged from trivial issues like lack of personal hygiene (her) to serious false claims of infidelity (citing my late work hours). After 4.5 months in US she demanded to be sent back to India. She left US in January, 2016.      After coming back to India, she and her father started spreading rumors about me and my family (residing in India) claiming that we demanded a dowry of Rs 10 Lakhs (!!!) and forcibly evicted her from the marital home in US.      After some time (April, 2016), her father came to visit my family with a crowd of relatives and demanded that I be asked to come to India and have a face to face discussion with them. I agreed but owing to work reasons could only come in August, 2016.   I informed my wife's mother in July, 2016 that I will be arriving in India 3rd Week of August.      I informed my wife's family of my arrival (through one of her cousin brother). There was no response.   We started to call her and her family members to set up a meeting but no one ever picked up the phone!!. Out of desperation, we contacted several of our relatives to try and call them but still no response. Eventually, I returned to US after wasting 3 weeks in this chaos.      On advise of some of our family members (lawyers), I sent her a final email and on receiving no reply, filed for a divorce in US.   She replied back to the divorce notice claiming the following:   - I asked her for dowry (Rs 10 Lakhs) and when she denied, tortured her   - I threw her out of my home and asked her to return back to India and only come back once she can bring back Rs 10 Lakhs dowry   - That she had filed DV and Maintenance case against me in August, 2016 (10 days before my arrival)      Now I am facing these cases in Indian court and am at serious legal and financial risk.      I have some specific questions (requests) regarding the maintenance case:   1. My monthly pre-Tax salary is around $8K. She has cited this as my income and asked for Rs 75000/ month maintenance.   2. She has mentioned in her complaint that she has no independent source of income BUT we know that she is working with a company in Faridabad and making a salary of around Rs 50K/ month (She has an M.Tech from IIT BHU). We also have some meager evidence - linkedin profile snapshot (now changed), recorded conversations with her mom and cousin      Questions -    1. Can the court still award her maintenance?   2. How much maintenance can the court award her?   3. Is it worth to hire a detective to gather more evidence of her employment?   4. I have evidence that she left US on her own accord (whatsapp messages). Would this be useful?   5. In general, how should I approach this case and what kind of evidence/documents should I gather to make a strong response",

The terrace area of other blocks has been sold by builder 10years ago but 5th block terrace area remains open now all the flat owners of the other blocks are claiming the rights of the terrace area of 5th block whether it is legally right or wrong. The landmark judgment delivered in the case of Sri Ramagauri Keshvlal Virani vs Walkeshwar Triveni Co-Operative Society is a case in point. In this case, there was a pocket terrace on the fifth and seventh floor of the building apart from the main terrace on the eighth floor. The flat owner on the seventh floor had two doors from his flat opening in the terrace besides he had also purchased the terrace from the developer. He contended that the entry of other residents to the terrace would disrupt his privacy and also pose a security threat. However, the court held that as the pocket terrace was not exclusively attached to his flat and had a common entrance, therefore, its use cannot be restricted to the disadvantage of the other residents. It has been seen that many buildings have terraces on certain floors, below the main terrace on the top floor. Developers often hoodwink the residents and sell these terraces to the adjacent flat owners thereby making huge profits. However, this too is against the law. A terrace that is not accessible from the common areas and is attached exclusively to a flat can only be sold to a flat owner but all other terraces are for the common usage. It is for the same reason a terrace is not included in the Floor Space Index (FSI) of an apartment. Reason: it cannot be bought or sold."

Many state enactments also specifically provide for the use of terraces. For example, Maharashtra Ownership of Flats Act, 1963 \u201cMOFA\u201d in section 10(1) and Section 4(1A) (a) (iii), (viii), (x) makes the intention explicitly clear. It states that a developer has no authority or right to sell the terrace to any individual which is the common easement of all the residents. The residents can complain against the developer by approaching the Consumer Forum and can complain against the society office-bearers with the Registrar of Societies. Additionally, residents may also file a civil suit in a court of law. It is illegal to sell terrace area. Approving authority will approve the project only. While selling, builder can make huge deviation in construction as well as in selling. Following are illegal: 1) Selling open car park area ( land is undivided share ). 2) Selling covered car park area to someone not owning flat in the apartment. 3) Selling Open Terrace i.e. top of the apartment. 4) Selling flats with more than one exit/entry doors. 6) many more ......... Approving authority does not know about any of such deviations while approving. If approved plan says that said part of terrace belongs to specific flat then only this selling would be legal."

So you object to jurisdiction of us courts as marriage was solemnised in India under Indian marriage laws. Better to suggest that you will return from the US at the earliest.   A fraudulent act may be grounds for annulment of marriage. In case of coercion or fraud the court shall not grant a decree of nullity if  Proceedings have not been instituted within one year after the coercion had ceased or the fraud had been discovered. The petitioner has with his or her free consent lived with the respondent after the coercion has ceased or the fraud had been discovered.  In such circumstances the acquiescence of the petitioner will be presumed to such an act or omission, and the right of the petitioner on these scores will be waived."

However argument on charge has not taken place and case is still at a very primitive stage in the court of delhi.      despite the fact i gave all the required documents to the IO to assist him in the investigation regarding which a D/D entry no has also been alloted to me when i submitted the documents still the IO did a very selective investigation and intentionally omitted the documents i gave him so as make a one sided case of prosecution strong....      The IO of the delhi police where fir is registered also did not include the investigation report submitted by the mumbai police which was against the girl.       Mumbai happens to be the matrimony home of the girl.      So my question is that i am a bit confused as to what can i do in a sutuation like this ???      A) should i pray for further investigation or re investigation??      B) should i approach the trial court first or the staight away approach the delhi high court by filing a writ ???",

Re-investigation or further investigation cannot be sought by the accused especially at the initial stage or after the police have filed the charge sheet before the court.  Only defacto complainant can seek a further investigation or anything.  The accused can challenge the charges in the trial proceedings on the basis of the documentary evidences he submitted before police already during the the process of investigation besides the ones he may additionally rely upon. 2. There's no use of approaching trial court or high court on this as the procedure of law is different to that of your thinking.  Instead you may approach high court with a petition under section 482 Cr.P.C  seeking to quash the charge sheet."

        "query-text": "We shifted from Hyderabad to Pune 2 months back as my wife got job in a startup in Pune. She was hired as a data scientist for her PhD. Company wanted her to join them to use her PhD tag in front of the customers. She made it clear on initial discussions that she cannot do coding and company was cool about it. They told that they wanted her to join as a lead and no coding is required. My job involves lot of international travel so she has to manage her job and our 3 years old baby on her own.      Issue started after joining them. She was asked to start working as a coder which she told will take her some time to start coding. She was learning coding and was doing reasonably good. She was given a help to learn her with coding who used to humiliate her in front of all employees and pass loose comments. He was expecting her to work late night where all other employees are male employees. Our daughter was to be picked from nursery and will go to mom\u2019s office sit in a corner watching iPad and mom will work. Her senior colleague will take all her work and present as his work in front of management. She complained this to management and they just gave her a deaf ear. She was in lot of mental trauma by the behaviour of her colleagues but she still continued thinking this as part of startup culture. She was continually harassed everyday and her life became hell. One fine day she forced to resign from company and was asked to leave without notice period.       The issue here are multiple:      1. No respect in workplace and continuity harassment by passing degrogratory comments.      2.no safety of women employee working late night      3. Mental stress leading to depression      4. Undue grounds to make her feel aliniated in workplace and forcing her to resign      5. No notice period and payout for notice period      6. Late night meeting with drinks and poker in office makes me feel unsafe      7. No one to listen your concern even if you take it to senior management       Now I am out of company and started treatment of depression and spending time with my little daughter. I really want to take action legally against these guys and needs help.",

They can guide you through the legal process and provide you with the best possible advice. Bail Application: If you or your family members have been arrested, your lawyer can file for bail to secure your release from custody. In many cases, bail can be granted if there's no substantial evidence against you, and the charges appear to be false. Collect Evidence: Work with your lawyer to gather evidence that can prove your innocence. This may include gathering witnesses who can vouch for your whereabouts at the time of the alleged incident, collecting any relevant documents, and obtaining any CCTV footage or other evidence that can support your defense. Challenge the Medical Certificate: If a fake medical certificate has been submitted, your lawyer can challenge its authenticity in court. This may involve obtaining a genuine medical opinion to counter the false certificate. Cross-Examine Witnesses: If the rich person's workers are being presented as witnesses, your lawyer can cross-examine them to expose any inconsistencies or contradictions in their statements. File a Counter Complaint: If you believe that the false charges were filed maliciously, you may consider filing a counter complaint against the individuals who filed the false charges or against the police officers who took bribes, if you have evidence to support such allegations. Seek Legal Remedies Against Police Misconduct: If there is evidence of police misconduct, such as taking bribes or filing false charges, you can pursue legal remedies against the officers involved. This might involve filing a complaint with higher-ranking police officials or approaching the courts to seek appropriate action. Maintain a Record: Keep a detailed record of all interactions related to the case, including conversations with your lawyer, court proceedings, and any evidence collected. This documentation can be crucial in building a strong defense. Attend Court Hearings: Make sure you and your family members attend all court hearings as required. Failure to appear can result in adverse consequences. Stay Informed: Stay informed about the progress of your case and follow the advice of your lawyer closely. Legal procedures in India can be complex, so it's essential to rely on professional guidance. IPC Section 323: Punishment for Voluntarily Causing Hurt This section deals with cases where a person voluntarily causes hurt to another. The punishment for this offense is imprisonment for up to one year or a fine, or both.Defense strategies: Self-defense: If you can establish that you caused hurt in self-defense, it may be a valid defense.Lack of intention: If it can be demonstrated that you did not intend to cause hurt, this could be a defense.Consent: If the victim consented to the actions that caused the hurt, this might be a defense.IPC Section 506: Punishment for Criminal Intimidation Section 506 deals with the offense of criminal intimidation. It prescribes punishment with imprisonment for up to 2 years or a fine, or both.Defense strategies: Lack of intention: If you can show that you did not intend to threaten or intimidate the victim, it could be a defense.No credible threat: If the threat made was not credible or lacked substance, it may be a defense.IPC Section 34: Acts Done by Several Persons in Furtherance of Common Intention This section deals with cases where a criminal act is committed by several persons in furtherance of a common intention. In such cases, each person is liable as if they had committed the act alone.Defense strategies: Lack of common intention: If it can be proven that there was no common intention among the accused, this defense may be applicable.Alibi: If you can establish that you were not present at the scene or were not involved in the alleged criminal act, this could be a defense."

According to Section 506 of the Indian Penal Code, whoever commits the offence of criminal intimidation shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both. If the threat is to cause death or grievous hurt, or to burn or destroy any property, or to accuse any person of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years, or to impute unchastity to a woman, then the punishment may extend to seven years, or with fine, or with both. According to Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, when a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone. Based on this information, it seems that you are charged with causing hurt and intimidation to the complainant along with four other members of your family who had a common intention to do so. However, you can defend yourself against these charges by proving that they are false and fabricated by the complainant and the cops who took bribe from him. You can also challenge the fake medical certificate and the witnesses of the complainant by producing your own evidence and witnesses to show that you were not present at the spot at that time and that there was no physical violence or threat involved in the verbal abuse between your parents and the complainant."

Also, a woman can file a case against her sister-in-law and sister. While hearing a challenge to the constitutional validity of Section 2 (q), which restricts definition of a respondent to a husband or male partner, a division bench of Chief Justice Mohit Shah and Justice M S Sonak said definition of aggrieved persons and domestic relations under the scheme of the Act is wide enough to include other than a wife or woman live-in partner. The judges gave the verdict on a petition filed by Haji Ali resident Kusum Harsora (54) and her mother Pushpa (78), saying that exclusion of a woman other than wife/ live-in partner of a male abuser is discriminatory. A magistrate had rejected their complaint against a sister-in-law and Kusum's two sisters saying \"mother\" and \"sister\" do not qualify as \"aggrieved persons\" under the Act. The judges passed their verdict in line with a Delhi HC ruling upholding inclusion of a mother for relief."

Anticipatory Bail: If you believe that you may be arrested in connection with the case, you can apply for anticipatory bail. Your attorney can help you with the bail application process, and if granted, it will protect you from arrest for a specified period. Prepare a Strong Defense: Work closely with your attorney to build a strong defense. This may include gathering evidence, interviewing witnesses, and developing a strategy to challenge the false charges. Challenge the Evidence: If you believe that the medical report is fake or that there is evidence of bribery, your attorney can help you challenge this evidence in court. This may involve cross-examining witnesses, including the doctor, and presenting evidence to counter the false allegations. Invoke Section 482 of CrPC: Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) allows the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to quash criminal proceedings that are frivolous or abusive. If you believe the case against you lacks merit, your attorney can file a petition under this section to seek the quashing of charges. Maintain Accurate Records: Keep records of all communication related to the case, including correspondence with your attorney, court documents, and any evidence that supports your innocence. Seek Mediation: In some cases, it may be possible to resolve the matter through mediation or reconciliation. Your attorney can explore this option if it is appropriate for your situation."

This section deals with cases where a person intentionally causes physical pain or injury to another person. The punishment for this offence can be imprisonment for up to one year, or a fine, or both.  Section 506 of the IPC - Punishment for criminal intimidation. This section deals with cases where a person threatens another person with injury to his/her person, reputation, or property, or to the person or reputation of anyone in whom he/she is interested, with the intent to cause alarm or to compel him/her to do or omit something. The punishment for this offence can be imprisonment for up to two years, or a fine, or both. Section 34 of the IPC - Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention. This section deals with cases where several persons act together with a common intention to commit an offence. Each of them is liable for that offence as if it was done by him/her alone.  There are various legal remedies available to deal with a false criminal case in India. Some of them are as follows:  Anticipatory bail: If you have reason to believe that you may be arrested on a false accusation, you can apply for an anticipatory bail in the Sessions Court or the High Court under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), 1973 before the arrest is made. This will protect you from being arrested and harassed by the police. Quashing of FIR: If you think that the FIR lodged against you is frivolous, vexatious, or malicious, you can file a petition in the High Court under Section 482 of the CrPC, 1973 for quashing the FIR. The High Court has the inherent power to quash any criminal proceeding if it finds that it is an abuse of the process of law or that it would cause injustice to the accused. Discharge: If after investigation, the police files a charge sheet against you in the court, you can file an application in the court under Section 227 of the CrPC, 1973 for discharge. The court can discharge you if it finds that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding against you. Acquittal: If after trial, the court finds that there is no evidence or insufficient evidence to prove your guilt beyond reasonable doubt, the court can acquit you under Section 232 of the CrPC, 1973. The court can also acquit you if it finds that there are any defects or irregularities in the prosecution case that affect its validity or credibility. Compensation: If after acquittal, you think that you have suffered any loss or injury due to the false accusation, you can file a suit in the civil court for compensation from your accuser. You can also file a complaint in the criminal court under Section 250 of the CrPC, 1973 for compensation from your accuser if he/she has filed a false complaint without any reasonable cause. Prosecution: If after acquittal, you think that your accuser has filed a false case against you with malicious intent or dishonest motive, you can file a complaint in the criminal court against your accuser under various sections of the IPC, such as Section 182 (false information to public servant), Section 193 (false evidence), Section 211 (false charge of offence), Section 499 (defamation), etc."

In a place, where the defendant resides, or carries on business, or In a place, where the cause of action has arisen, i.e. where the dispute or wrong took place. It is well settled that a civil court has inherited power to decide its own jurisdiction. In dealing with the question whether a civil court\u2019s jurisdiction to entertain a suit is barred or not, it is necessary to bear in mind that every presumption should be made in favor of the jurisdiction of a civil court. The exclusion of jurisdiction of a civil court to entertain civil causes should not be readily inferred unless the relevant statute contains an express provision to that effect, or leads to a necessary and inevitable implication of the nature. Under section 9 of the civil procedure code the court shall have jurisdiction to try all suits of civil nature excepting suits of which cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred. A statute, therefore, expressly or by necessary implication can bar the jurisdiction of civil courts in respect of a particular matter. The mere conferment of special jurisdiction on a tribunal in respect of the said matter does not in itself exclude the jurisdiction of civil courts. The statute may specifically provide for ousting the jurisdiction of civil courts; even if there was no such specific exclusion, if it creates liability not existing before and gives a special and particular remedy for the aggrieved party, the remedy provided by it must be followed. The same principle would apply if the statute had provided for the particular forum in which the remedy could be had. Even in such cases, the civil court\u2019s jurisdiction is not completely ousted. A suit in a civil court will always lie to question the order of a tribunal created by statute, even if its order is, expressly or by necessary implication, made final, if the said tribunal abuses its power or does not act under the act but in violation of its provisions. So you can file the case at Delhi where the cause of action aroused or at Haridwar where the defendant is residing or the specific place which mention in your contract with customer if any"

A reading of the Proviso to sub-section (4) as well as the language employed in sub-section (5) would indicate that they are intended to safeguard the interest of an Insurer who otherwise has no liability to pay any amount to the insured but for the provisions contained in Chapter XI of the Act. This means, the insurer has to pay to the third parties only on account of the fact that a Policy of Insurance has been issued in respect of the vehicle, but the Insurer is entitled to recover any such sum from the insured if the Insurer were not otherwise liable to pay such sum to the insured by virtue of the conditions of the contract of insurance indicated by the policy 2) The insurer and the insured are bound by the conditions enumerated in the policy and the Insurer is not liable to the insured if there is violation of any policy condition. But the insurer who is made statutorily liable to pay compensation to third parties on account of the certificate of insurance issued shall be entitled to recover from the insured the amount paid to the third parties, if there was any breach of policy conditions on account of the vehicle being driven without a valid driving licence. ... 3) . In National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Swaran Singh,(2004) 3 SCC 297, the Supreme Court examined the liability of the Insurance Company vis-a-vis the owner and held that the liability of the Insurance Company would arise both from contract as well as from statute. Elaborately considering the insurer's contractual liability as well as statutory liability vis-a-vis the claims of third parties, the Supreme Court held as under: \"31. The right of the victim of a road accident to claim compensation is a statutory one. He is a victim of an unforeseen situation. He would not ordinarily have a hand in it. The negligence on the part of the victim may, however, be contributory. He has suffered owing to wrongdoing of others. An accident may ruin an entire family. It may take away the only earning member. An accident may result in the loss of her only son to a mother. An accident may take place for a variety of reasons. The driver of a vehicle may not have a hand in it. He may not be found to be negligent in a given case. Other factors such as unforeseen situation, negligence of the victim, bad road or the action or inaction of any other person may lead to an accident"

Where a Muslim acknowledges a child to be his legitimate child, the paternity of that child is established upon him. It cannot be availed of to legitimise a child known to be illegitimate. However recently, the Supreme Court in a landmark judgment extended the right of adoption to Muslims also. In  the Case titled as Shabnam Hashmi v Union of India, (2014) 4 SCC 1, the Supreme Court declared that the right to adopt a child by a person as per the provisions of Juvenile Justice Act would prevail over all personal laws and religious codes in the country. The Three judge bench consisting of Chief Justice P. Sathasivam and Justices Ranjan Gogoi and Shiv Kirti Singh however maintained that personal laws would continue to govern any person who chooses to submit himself until such time that the vision of a uniform civil code is achieved.   The Juvenile Justice Act, 2002 defines adoption in Section 2(aa). It confers upon the adoptive parents and the child all rights, privileges and responsibilities that are attached to a normal parent child relationship."

He married mom without giving divorce to his first wife(she passed away 3 years back). He has three children to his first wife. He has never taken care of us.Mom raised us against all odds fighting against dad.Dad did not even do any rituals to mom as per tradition. Dad already found one more woman as partner as soon as mom fell ill and harassed mom from past one year for money.Now he is harassing us to give money which we will get from mother's office. He is also saying that he is not responsible for sister's marriage too.He also went to office and had verbal spat with officials.    They are asking for legal hire certificate and dad is demanding 20 Lakhs (which is way higher than what we get) to sign.      He already consulted a lawyer and threatening us that he will put a case.       So i have the following queries.   1) can my dad be legal hier of mother (assuming marriage is legally void)? Is his sign required to get     a legal hier certificate ?       2) For PF,gratuity,insurance,etc., he is asking for share. When asked about sister's marriage, he is     not bothered at all. what should i do ?       3) For pension and job (compassionate ground),only sister(unmarried) is eligible. Dad is not     agreeing to declare sister as legal hier. He is not concerned at all as he has nothing to lose.    what can be done ?

The High Court noting that the marriage being first cousins, who were Hindus, was illegal and thus the Court could not give such direction. The High Court, however expressed no opinion on the arrangement entered into between the two being of the view that they both were majors and thus free to take their decisions.   The High Court inter alia observed as under; 2. Counsel appearing for the petitioner, however, submits that the Court should issue further direction to the respondents to hand over the custody of Harmandeep Kaur to the petitioner. Inthe facts of the present case, we do not think it proper to consider this prayer. That is so, because, it is the case of the petitioner that he has entered into marriage with Harmandeep Kaur on 21st January, 2009 knowing fully well that the said Harmandeep Kaur is his first cousin. In view of Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the marriage between the petitioner and Harmandeep Kaur Kuldeep Singh cannot be treated as valid. It is void on account of clause (v) of Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. If the request of the petitioner was to be considered, it would be putting seal of approval of the Court on the arrangement arrived at between the petitioner and the said Harmandeep Kaur. At the same time, we may observe that said Harmandeep Kaur is admittedly major. She is free to take her own decision, if she so desires. That decision could be in consultation with her parents and relatives. We express no opinion with regard to that. In our opinion, no further order is warranted in this petition. Petition is disposed of."

                "response-text": "Dear Sir, Better get it executed in Sub-Registrar Office, Magadi, Bengaluru Rural District. For draft please discuss. The procedure is as follows: ================================================================= Valid Will  There should be a name of the Testator. The testator has the right to appoint a Legatee. The Will would be executed after the death of Testator. Under Section 63, Indian Succession Act, 1925 a Will can be revoked by the testator during his lifetime and can also make an alteration in the will which is called Codicil. A third party does not have the right to file a civil suit against testator on the ground of alteration or cancellation of a Will. The intention of the testator is supreme and has the power to revoking the previous testamentary instruments and stating that \u2018This is my last Will\u2019. The testator can make a declaration of his will multifarious time but when he or she uses the word \u2018Last and Only will\u2019 at the time of his death it would be assumed that all the previous will was revoked and a fresh will come into effect. If the original will has been lost, it is mandatory for the testator to provide proper evidence with a legitimate reasoning for the revocability of the will. If it is proved in the court of law that an original will is lost then \u2018Subsequent will\u2019 is valid and will be executed.  Procedure to Make A Will While making a will all the necessary provision is taken into consideration with utmost care and must contain several part and clause. Although there is no particular format that is adopted while making a will. But in a will the testator should include:  In the first paragraph, there should be full name, address, age, etc. of the person who is making the will stating that he is making the will in a free sense and free from any kind of pressure and undue influence. It is the duty of the testator to reveal all the information about the property and documents. To tell the current value of the house, land, bank fixed deposit, mutual funds and the share certificates owned by the testator. This information should be disclosed or communicated to the executor of the will or any of the family members or friends. When an original will is made the testator should clearly mention who should acquire his entire property (in case of Muslims, Will cannot be made for more than 1/3rdof the property) so that the interest of the successor is not infringed after the death of the testator. In case of the minor, the legal guardian should be made as the beneficiary of the property, so that when the person becomes major he has right to inherit the property. Although he has the rights not to accept the property. Once the original will is finalized, the testator should sign the will carefully in presence of at least two witnesses, who also have to sign after the testator signature. The will should also contain the date and place at the bottom and it is not mandatory for the person to sign all the pages but he may sign so that there is no legal instability. With the death of the testator, the executor of the will or a legal heir of the deceased should apply for probate. The court will ask the executor or the heir if there is any objection regarding the execution of the will. If there is no such objection, the court will grant probate. A probate is generally considered as evidence in order to execute the will. If there is any objection raised by the heirs in executing the will, the parties are called upon to make mutual consent. If there is no objection raised the probate will be granted and the will would be executed.  \u2018Joint Will\u2019 In Comparison With \u2018Other Wills\u2019 There are different types of will like Simple Will, a Testamentary trust will, Living wills and Joint wills. But Joint will is different from the other wills because it is created and executed by two testators usually a married couple who leave all their property for each other. It means that the testator who dies first, his or her estate would be distributed to the other testator. A will cannot be revoked without the mutual consent of both the testator but when one of the testators dies it can be revoked. The concept of joint will provide that:  That when one spouse dies, the other testator will inherit everything, and When the second spouse dies, everything directly goes to the person in whose favour will is made.  But the concept of joint will is hardly used in India. While making a joint will there are certain provisions laid down that a single spouse cannot revoke or alter any clause until and unless there is a mutual consent between the two spouses. A conventional will can be revoked at any point in time but a joint will cannot be revoked as it is a legally binding contract. In Narayani and Anr. v. Sreedharan[1], Kerala High Court held that: \u201cA joint Will is a single testamentary instrument constituting or containing the Will of two or more persons based on an agreement to make a conjoint Will. Two or more persons can make a joint Will, which if properly executed by each so far as his property is concerned is as much his Will. That will come into effect on his death.\u201d How many people can make a joint will? A minimum number of member required for making a joint will is two whereas \u2018n\u2019 number of members can make a joint will. Best practices to follow while drafting a joint will A joint will can be revoked at any time during the lifetime of the testators or after the death of one of the testator. A joint will can be executed with each other or with the third person in accordance with a proper agreement or contract in order to transfer or dispose of the property. A joint will can be made with another person through an agreement but it cannot be revoked by one testator. If a joint will is made by the surviving testator with another person, then the testator gets to benefit from the legal document that has been created between the testator and another person. When a testator enters into a contract or agreement with another person, the clause of the will should be definite so that the joint testator cannot revoke it will when they receive benefits from the will. The joint will is generally made when:  The testator is in a dominant position but that does not mean that they seize all the legal rights of a person. As the concept of joint will clearly state that one of the testators cannot revoke a joint will, mutual consent is necessary. At the same time if it can be proved that there is no such agreement made between the parties then the testator has the right to revoke the will. If one testator has died without disposing of his property and has not revoked the joint will, the other testator has the right to do so, although an agreement has been made. But if it is clearly mentioned in the agreement that a notice has been given to a survivor not to alter or revoke the will, then he cannot do so. Since the will gives him the right to dispose of his property or make an alteration on his part. In case deceased has not altered or revoked his will, the survivor will get a probate from the court which would be considered as the \u2018Last Will\u2019. The survivor has the power to execute the provision of the joint will.  Precautions to take while drafting a joint will The concept of joint will is hardly used because it is not possible for the surviving spouse to change the terms and condition of the will, as it may not give him or her right to dispose of the property of the deceased. The survivor may not able to make an alteration in the will because:  It puts a restriction on the money that is going to be inherited by the child who is financially weak. If the child gets the property very early, they may misuse the property or may sell it to another person at a very low price.  Registration of joint will Although in India, the registration of will not compulsory but it can be registered at the discretion of testator. But it is not easy to get joint will registered after the death of the testator (i.e. husband). It should be registered by Sub-Registrar, checking the validity of the will. The sub-registrar has the discretion to register the will. They have to check the validity of the will because there are instances where the registration is done fraudulently or by forgery. Procedure  A joint will can be executed on plain paper without requiring any stamp duty for execution and registration of will. The Government fee should be paid. The testator along with two witnesses has to register the joint will before the Sub-Registrar. For registering a joint an identity proof such as Aadhar Card, Voter ID card, Passport etc. A will cannot be registered online.  What can be bequeathed in a joint will? In a joint will, the testator bequeaths or leaves his property and assets which he or she has acquired throughout his or her life. The property would be transferred in favour of the legatee. Whether ancestral property can be given by a way of joint will? No, the ancestral property cannot be given by undivided share in the mitakshara or dayabhaga co-parcenary property. Who can raise suspicion in a joint will? A suspicion can be raised by one of spouse if the other spouse goes against the terms and condition of the will. The third party can raise the suspicion that should be in favour of natural legal heirs of the deceased. Supreme Court Rules on Right of Alienation in a joint will and mutual will Alienation is defined as a capacity for a piece of property or a property right to be sold or otherwise transferred from one party to another. Although the property is generally deemed to be alienable, it may be subject to restraints on alienation. In K.S. Palanisami (Dead) v. Hindu community in general and citizens of Gobichettipalayam and others[2], the Supreme Court of India discussed on the issue related to an \u2018absolute right\u2019 to deal with the properties under a \u2018joint and mutual will\u2019. The Court held that when there is any legal declaration made by the testator with respect to property then the court cannot ignore or add any word while executing the will. The intention of the testator is taken into consideration while reading the language of the document. Generally, in a joint will, the word \u2018absolute\u2019 is used many times which leads to myriad interpretations:"

These factors include the character of the parent, economic conditions of the parents, any specified \u2018will\u2019 of a deceased parent, the moral environment at home, age and sex of the child and so on. Children\u2019s preferences are generally considered after 9 years of age. Some archaic considerations still remain, which means that in case of remarriage of a woman, generally custody is not granted to her while it may be granted to a father who remarries, especially if the second wife cannot give birth. There are two types of child custody which may be granted. One is \u2018sole custody\u2019 where only one spouse gets the physical custody of a child. The other is \u2018joint custody\u2019 where both the spouses share the custody of the child. The land mark judgment of SC on the Subject is as follows: In view of this judgment if welfare of child in the hands of father is 100 percent assured then court can give such custody to the father irrespective of the age of the child. Landmark Judgement pronounced by SC dealing with guardianship & custodial and visitation rights to parents and children stuck in matrimonial disputes In a remarkable judgment dealing with interim custody of child suffering in parent\u2019s matrimonial disputes, visitation rights and guardianship, a 2 judge bench of Supreme Court laid down various propositions of law while awarding the interim custody till final disposal by the trial court to the mother. The bench speaking through Justice Vikramjit Sen, lays down very sharp observations and examines various definitions of a \u2018guardian\u2019, \u2018visitation rights\u2019 and tests the issue from the angle of provisions of Hindu Minority & Guardianship Act, 1956 and Guardian & Wards Act, 1890.In a custody battle between estranged parents, a minor child, who has not completed five years of age, shall be allowed to remain with the mother, the Supreme Court has ruled saying that in such cases child should not treated as a \"chattel\". The court said that under Hindu Minority and Guardianship (HMG) Act, a father can be guardian of the property of the minor child but not the guardian of his person if the child is less than five years old. The Court said that there can be no cavil that when a Court is confronted by conflicting claims of custody there are no rights of the parents which have to be enforced; the child is not a chattel or a ball that is bounced to and fro the parents. It is only the child's welfare which is the focal point for consideration. Parliament rightly thinks that the custody of a child less than five years of age should ordinarily be with the mother and this expectation can be deviated from only for strong reasons."

There were two paper on same day , she came in break time and started getting sexual , i mentioned her i did\u2019t have any precautions, we can get protection before we proceed or we can have sex after she gets free from her exam. But she said she would take pills and started to force herself on me. After exam she and I went to our homes and the same day she took the pill .  After one month i.e. MAY2018, she said she is pregnant and had ectopic pregnancy. Her family members did\u2019t react to her pregnancy. She refused to get surgery and started blaming me since then , after that in September2018 she asked to meet her and we did\u2019t have penetration sex because i did\u2019t have precaution and refused to have sex. She blocked me and left me with little fight. After one month, she messaged she had abortion. She did\u2019t share any report. And start blaming me indirectly. I always requested to get proper treatment but she simply refused, she did\u2019t take rest and travelled 7-8hours distance tours many times, and she drank couple of times also and this made her condition worse.      She is telling i have destroyed her life, i have played with her, i made sexual relation with marriage proposal(but i did\u2019t) . She lie many times, previously i had guilt feeling because i did\u2019t know deeply about ectopic pregnancy. She started approaching my family 2019. She came to my house in odd hours. My family clearly said we will not accept this marriage and disown our son.    She threaten me that she will commit suicide and shared picture of her bleeding  wrist. I got scared and consoled her and told her that I will marry her and 2 days later I told I won\u2019t marry as I have agreed under her suicidal pressure. She threaten me saying ab dekhna main kya karti hu, jindagi bhar pachtaoge\u201d. And as of now she has not get recovered from her ectopic pregnancy and she is under the treatment.      Now her father is also approaching my family. I tried to tell him that her daughter is blackmailing me and forcing to marry her.       What legal complications can be there, how can i save myself from such situation. What if she commits suicide and what if she files a rape case ?",

Courts in India have time and again frowned upon the practice of women to implicate men in false cases of rape when the relationship goes to rocks. She may also do this-file a criminal complaint of rape under Section 376 IPC on the ground that you promised to marry her and thereby induced her to consent to sexual intercourse. If and when the FIR is registered you should immediately apply for anticipatory bail. 2. Send an advance intimation to police regarding her threats so that a safety valve is created for you."

In other words such hostile possession shall not be secret and person in adverse possession must not acknowledge the title of the true owner but has to deny the title of the true owner. The adverse possession must be capable of being known by the parties interested in the property, though it is not necessary that there should be evidence of the adverse possessor actually informing the real owner of the former's hostile action 3) In the case of Amrendra Pratap Singh vs. Tej Bahadur Prajapati,(2004) 10 SCC 65, it has been held that, the process of acquisition of title by adverse possession springs into action essentially by default or inaction of the owner. Thus, a method of gaining legal title to real property by the actual, open, hostile, and continuous possession of it to the exclusion of its true owner for the period prescribed by law is a adverse possession.  4) It is important to note that the starting point of limitation of 12 years is counted from the point of time \u201cwhen the possession of the defendants becomes adverse to the plaintiff\u201d . So technically, given that 25 years timeline has passed, you can claim your title on the grounds of adverse possession. Hope this information is useful."

She went to her native in the pretext of Diwali vacation. She had planned from 21 Oct to 02 Nov .   She came with her family - her father , her brother , her sister in laws , her mama, on 23 Oct , for 3 hours,and deliberately had a huge fight in this very house.  Her brothers bullied us in this house.      In between she coyly with her fathers help took a flat on rent 3 km close by. On 01 Nov 2014 she was in Pune and her father and her brother helped her to find a flat and accomodate her.    From 02 Nov 2014 to 08 Nov 2014, she did not respond to any messages and then disclosed only when she got settled.         Her parents are staying with her . Her demand is as follows   (1) I should not take my daughter to my house during weekedays and that my daughter should not stay overnight in this house.   I am missing the time with my daughter as I am not getting the chance to take her studies and impart fatherly duties such as getting her ready for her school . I am traumatized to understand by the separation from my daughter.   I have asked a 50 - 50 time , and she flatly refuses and cities that she will file a police complaint.   In event of this what will i have to do ? Should i get myself bullied into my wifes dictation ?   Since we are still married , I can very well take my child with me as long as I like . Can I or can't I.      (2) She maintains that she does not want to return to this home as she cites cruelty from my mother. The matter of fact is that my mother is a diabetic and my wife inspite of being a doctor has not a cent bit taken care of my mother. It is I who has to take care of mother along with my father.   Also she intends to keep my child away from my mother and my father,      (3) I am so full of anguish against her and her joint family that i have lost any feelings for her. She claims to the world that she wants only us to live together as a family separately. But matter of fact is that she is guided by her brothers and father.      (4) between there is a property registered in my name and her name. I am the one paying all the emi's so far from my bank account. She pays me as and when she has money and her contribution to my account is just 10 % of the total cost so far.      I am cornered as law accords lots of power to women. At the same time there is so much that I am losing out. Mainly I am losing out of my health due to not being able to raise my daughter .   I have not intention to stay with my wife as I am always reminded of her brothers bully.      In this case even i approach the police it shall be treated as a family dispute and will not be entertained. But I want to have a stay on her brothers as they will whisk away my child away from me.      At present she is going to purchase a car worth Rs 5 lakhs and she shall be paying for the loan of the car roughly Rs 12000 all by herself. Her car is partially sponsored by her father. And she vehemently denies that she is getting any support from her brothers or her Father in trying to pull me out of existing house and away from my parents.       Please advise what I should do ?   should I give in and stay with her just for the sake of my daughter ?   I intend to get divorced as I hate my wife now ,but that is a long and costly procedure and my wife does not want to part with the property in which she is joint owner.   My case seems hopeless what am I to do ?",

Raj kumar  it has been ruled that the dependants of employees, who die in harness, do not have any special claim or right to employment, except by way of the concession that may be extended by the employer under the rules or by a separate scheme, to enable the family of the deceased to get over the sudden financial crisis. The claim for compassionate appointment is, therefore, traceable only to the scheme framed by the employer for such employment and there is no right whatsoever outside such scheme.           3) n General Manager, State Bank of India and Others v. Anju Jain[4] it has been clearly stated that appointment on compassionate ground is never considered to be a right of a person. In fact, such appointment is violative of rule of equality enshrined and guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution. As per the settled law, when any appointment is to be made in Government or semi-government or in public office, cases of all eligible candidates are be considered alike. The State or its instrumentality making any appointment to public office, cannot ignore the mandate of Article 14 of the Constitution. At the same time, however, in certain circumstances, appointment on compassionate ground of dependants of the deceased employee is considered inevitable so that the family of the deceased employee may not starve. The primary object of such scheme is to save the bereaved family from sudden financial crisis occurring due to death of the sole bread winner. It is an exception to the general rule of equality and not another independent and parallel source of employment.           4) you can file writ in HC against rejection by railways of  your claim of compassionate appointment"

Main building area is 1800 sqm plus porches/chhajja.      Since beginning contractor has been quite slow and not able to manage the things properly. Most of the time workers are not available and also has payment issues with his vendors.      I have requested / warned him several time to expedite the work so that project can be completed within stipulated time but all in vain.      Till now only 50% of works completed and we are left with 60 days only.       Now he has come up with new theory that extra work is being done for with he is demanding extra money literally blackmailing. whereas half of the work only has been done till now and i have made appx 90% payment.      He is demanding extra money for porches/chhajja stating that agreement is mentioning total floor area 1800 sq ft whereas agreement is not mentioning payment based on area rather fixed amount.      Now i feel contractor will certainly not be able to complete the project before agreed date i.e 3.8.2019.      How can i undertake the work myself / hand over to other agencies after contract period and what should i do in this regards.

                "response-text": "You cannot be sued under IPC section 317 or section 75 for abandonment of the child, if you decide to live separately from your husband and leave the baby in his care. Section 317 of the Indian Penal Code states that anyone who is the parent or caretaker of a child under twelve years and intentionally leaves the child in a place with the intention of completely abandoning them can be punished with imprisonment for up to seven years, or a fine, or both. Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 states that anyone who leaves a child in any place with the intention of abandoning them can be punished with imprisonment for up to three years, or a fine of one lakh rupees, or both. However, in your case, you are not leaving the child in any place, but in the care of your husband, who is also the child\u2019s father and natural guardian. Therefore, you are not abandoning the child, but merely giving up your custody rights. You are also willing to take care of the child and live separately from your husband, which shows that you are not neglecting or deserting the child. Therefore, you cannot be charged under these sections for abandonment of the child. However, this does not mean that you will not face any legal repercussions if you decide to live separately from your husband and leave the child with him. Some of the possible legal consequences are:  Your husband may file for divorce on the grounds of cruelty or desertion by you under Section 13(1)(ia) or (ib) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. He may also claim alimony or maintenance from you under Section 25 of the same act. Your husband may file for sole custody or guardianship of the child under Section 6 or 7 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956. He may also claim child support or maintenance from you under Section 20 of the same act. You may lose your parental rights and responsibilities towards the child, such as your right to visitation, access, education, health, religion, etc. You may also lose your inheritance rights over the child\u2019s property. You may face social stigma and discrimination from your family and society for leaving your husband and child.  Therefore, it is advisable that you do not take such a drastic step without considering all the legal and personal implications. You should try to resolve your marital issues amicably with your husband and seek professional help if needed. You should also think about the best interests and welfare of your child and how your decision will affect him or her. You should consult a lawyer for specific guidance on your case."

If the police is not responding or evasive to your complaint you may approach the higher police officer of your city with a similar complaint to intervene and direct the police to take appropriate action as envisaged in law.

(This has been recently allowed by the Delhi High Court). If acting on the settlement you have made any payment, you can file a complaint for cheating on your wife.Alternately, the remedy available to you is to file a Divorce petition under any of the grounds mentioned under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. This would be a contested petition and may take a much longer period for you to get Divorced as compared to your current petition under Mutual grounds wherein the time taken is 6 months under normal circumstances."

        "query-text": "My sister is married for 4 years now. But in-laws are extremely overpowering and controlling. She is facing a lot of mental and emotional abuse from in-laws reducing her self esteem and self respect. So much so that, she had to get seperated few months back as she could not bear the environment of physical, mental and emotional abuse.       My brother in law works at his fathers business. He is also been abused by his parents since childhood making him a submissive son. He pays monthly salary and wants him to keep on working under him. He always abuses him saying he is good for nothing and still eats under his umbrella. I asked my brother in law to leave his fathers business and do something on his own but, he has been work in this firm since past 15 years and has built this business. It wouldn\u2019t have been possible without his contribution. My father is suggesting to leave the place and come without giving any fight. I think it is unfair for him to separate without any capital. He has given 15 years of his life which he will not get back. He needs to get his due share of the enterprise. Please provide your insight on this.        His father always comes and create rucus at their new home. Create a scene and always threten that he will bring them to the streets. Saying de-meaning and belitteling abusive slurs. He is a drunkard and wife beater and now also thretened to beat my sister like he beats his own wife. He has also called my father several times and threaten to murder when he was drunk and come and rape my family people.       And the mother in law has tortured my sister to get more money from my parents. They always want gifts for festivals and any family events. And the sister in law who stays in US instruct her mom to torture my sister.       My sister, brother in law, and my family are fed-up with their behavior and abuse. They are financially well off. And my father and mother had carried this mind-set of being submissive as we are from the girls end. But they have taken advantage of this. My father is afraid to go to seek legal counsel or go to police because it will tarnish his reputation which I think is absurd mindset. Second he is afraid of losing time and money in the legal system of India.       I have asked my sister and parents to document (record video/audio) whenever they interact with in-laws.       What should my sister do to not only discontinue abuse and hold them liable for years of torture they have inflicted?       What can my brother in-law do to earn his due share in the family enterprise he contributed for 15 years? So that he can start a new life comfortably.       What can my parents do to not be abused by the in-laws? How can my parents be protected from any physical harm.      Answers to these questions and any other insights is immensely appreciated.",

                "response-text": "Send a legal notice to the money lender to return the cheque leaf. You may file two complaints suspected to misuse your blank check.  To bank (stop payment + reason) Nearest Police station.( reason + legal notice details )   All the details (amount, transaction date, cheque No., Name and address of the person (money lender) etc.. are clearly mentioned in the complaint and also mention about the transaction is completed . When anyone files a Cheque case against you then you can use this evidence. And burden is shifted to the complainant to prove the transaction and cheque details. The Supreme Court in the case of Raj Kumar Khurana v. State of (NCT OF DELHI) and Another,[1] had decided whether if a cheque is lost or reported stolen, can a case of cheque bouncing under 138 NI Act be still made, and observed that, \u201cSection 138 of the Act moreover provides for a penal provision. A penal provision created by reason of a legal fiction must receive strict construction. (See R. Kalyani v. Janak C. Mehta[3] and DCM Financial Services Ltd. v. J.N. Sareen[4]) Such a penal provision, enacted in terms of the legal fiction drawn would be attracted when a cheque is returned by the bank unpaid. Such non-payment may either be: (i) because of the amount of money standing to the credit of that account is insufficient to honour the cheque, or (ii) it exceeds the amount arranged to be paid from that account by an agreement made with that bank. Before a proceeding thereunder is initiated, all the legal requirements therefor must be complied with. The court must be satisfied that all the ingredients of commission of an offence under the said provision have been complied with.\u201d The Supreme Court further observed that since the parameters for invoking the provisions of Section 138 NI Act are limited, the Bank\u2019s refusal to honor the cheque is not mischief as per the provisions of Section 138 NI Act. Thus, as per the Supreme Court, if it can be proved that the cheque was reported stolen or lost and the same was intimated to the bank and / or to the police, a complaint under Section 138 NI Act cannot be made out as there has to be a strict interpretation that has to be given to the provisions of Section 138 because of the legal fiction that has been made in it."

The relevant functions and duties of Notaries are as follows for your ready reference and further action against him if he is living.: =================================================================================== FUNCTIONS OF A NOTARY PUBLIC IN INDIA Who is a Notary? Notary is person appointed by the Central Government or state government under Notaries Act, 1952. The Central Government may appoint a notary for the whole or any part of the country. Likewise, the state government may appoint a notary for the entire or for any part of the state. A Notary is a public officer.   What are the functions of a notary? The chief functions of a notary public are governed by the Notaries Act, 1952. We shall confine ourselves to the major functions that are more relevant to the public:   1. To verify, authenticate, certify or attest the execution of any instrument. The word instrument is defined in the Act as every document by which any right or liability is or purports to be, created, transferred, modified, limited, extended, suspended, extinguished or recorded. So every document is not an instrument, unless it confers a right or records a liability. Each word namely verify, authenticate, certify and attest has a different meaning. \u2018Verify\u2019 means checking with the facts and proof/evidence produced. \u2018Authenticate\u2019 means, the notary has assured himself of the identity of the person who has signed the instrument as well as to the fact of execution. \u2018Certify\u2019 means to confirm through a formal statement that the instrument executed possesses certain qualifications or meeting the accepted minimum standards relevant to the contents of the same. Notary is bound to make entry of the notarial act of certifying the copy of the document as a true copy of its original. \u2018Attest\u2019 means to affirm to be correct, true or genuine. 2. To administer oath to or take an affidavit from any person. 3. To translate and verify the translation, of any document from one language into another. 4. To act as commissioner, to record evidence in any civil or criminal trial if so directed by the court or authority. 5. To act as arbitrator, mediator, or conciliator if so required. To do any other act which may be prescribed When is a notarial act completed? Every notarial act has to be done under his signature and notary seal with registered number and date. What is a notary seal? It is mandatory for notary to use his official seal. The Notaries Rules 1956, has prescribed the form and design of the seal to be used. It shall be plain circular seal of 5 cms diameter. It shall contain the name of notary, the jurisdictional area where he has been appointed to exercise his functions, the registration number, and circumscription \u201cnotary\u201d and the name of the government which appointed him. The notary shall use his office seal on every document. The Evidence Act also provides that the courts should take judicial notice of seal of the notary. In the absence of the seal of the notary, the document has no evidentiary value. Are the affidavits verified by notary admissible in courts? The Section 139 of Code of Civil Procedure 1908 has an express provision, in this regard, where any affidavit verified by notary is admissible as evidence. Likewise, Section 297 of Code of Criminal Procedure provides for admission of affidavits verified by the notary. Does notary public have to ensure that proper stamp duty is paid on instrument? Before doing any act of notary, it is the duty of the notary to ensure that the proper stamp duty is paid, if not he may impound it under Section 33(1) of the Stamp Act. Apart from the regular stamp duty, the act of notary attracts additional stamp duty under Article 42 of Indian Stamp Act, 1899 and the relevant provisions of the State Act concerned.   Does notary charge any fee for doing notarial acts? The Notarial Rules 1956, has prescribed the fee for each category of act. The rule No.10 refers to the fee to be collected by the notary. He should display rates of fee charged in conspicuous space both inside and outside his chamber or office. In addition to the fee, notary may also charge the travelling allowance by train or road at Rs.5 per kilo metre."

Some people may not desire to perform marriage as per their religious customs and prefer marriage under Special Marriage Act. There exists a 30-day notice requirement to be given in India if one partner is permanently and the other partner is temporarily residing in India. Marriages between Indian and a foreign national also shall be registered under this Act.

        "query-text": "I am Aravind from Chennai and have taken a loan of Rs.1,90,317/- from Loantap Credit Products Private limited having HQ at Pune and office at 4B, Congress Exhibition Road, Calcutta - 17 on May 15th 2021.   Loan Details: Rs. 200000 /-   Insurance Fees: Rs. 2432 /-   Processing Fees: Rs. 4720 /-   Broken Period Interest: Rs. 2531 /-      The loan tenure is 36 months and I have to pay Rs.2,75,004 in 36 EMIs which is almost 18% Interest for 3 yrs. The principal amount is Rs.1,90,317/- and Interest amount is Rs.85,004.   I have paid a total of Rs.2,00,741/- in multiple EMIs dated from 24th June 2021 to 5th Dec 2023 paying more than the Principal Amount.    Now I got a Legal notice demanding my presence to Kolkatta Metropolitan Magistrate Court Jurisdiction on 9th Feb 2024 claiming that I am accused [Summons To an accused Person / Section:68 of the code of criminal Procedure] and have to present myself to the Court for breaching under Section 25 of The Payment and Settlement system Act, 2007.    I have also reached the Loantap team for settlement even after paying more than the principal amount for which they demanded me to pay further more Rs.80,000/- which is completely abnormal.      Now, they falsely claimed that they have sent the Demand notice on 25th October which I haven't received and they falsely claim that I have missed their 15 days deadline to repay the debts and filed an accusation case against me.   Moreover they tried to loot Rs.2,00,000 from my bank account by passing a cheque on Oct 5th 2023 I have given it for safety purposes and fortunately it was bounced. Until Oct 5th 2023, I have paid Rs.1,96,000/- towards my loan of Rs.1,90,317/- and under what rationality they have bounced a cheque [ECS] for Rs.2,00,000/-. They also mentioned in the legal notice that Rs.2,00,000/- as Every month EMI for the loan principle of Rs.1,90,317/- which is also completely illegal.   In March 23rd 2023 \u2013 Filed a Police Complaint in Senior Police Inspector of Pune.    Moreover, they tried to loot the excess amount from my account and also filed a case under false grounds without clearly mentioning the loan amount and tenure rather only mentioning about the cheque bounced. The cheque placed should be only for my EMI amount which is Rs.7,639/- and not a complete principal amount Rs.1,90,317/- and falsely implicating me under cheque bounce case.   I request that the authorities take severe action against the real law offenders and cheating people in the name of financial institutions, causing severe distress to the citizens of the country.   Further details needed for this case, which I will enclose or else share via mail. Please guide me.      Thanks in advance,   Aravind",

        "query-text": "This project started around 2007 and construction of the building is completed. Builder has CC until only 16th floor and he built 22 floors already. This is one of the redevelopment project where builder built 2 towers, 22 floors each(1 private tower and 1 for tenants)   Builder gave the possession to most of the residents from floor 1 to 22, whoever paid the 100% amount in private tower.   BMC came and demolished 3 flats last week only from inside (not the whole floor) between 17 and 22 in private tower which were not occupied. I am the owner of one of the flat between 17th and 22nd. BMC also warned the residents of flats between 17th and 22 that if builder did not pay the said penalty, They will start demolishing from inside just like the other 3 unoccupied flats. For now, Builder paid the said amount to BMC.   Builder says that he does not have money to pay the remaining 3.5 cr to BMC to get the CC from flr 17 till 22. Builder is asking to pay the remaining balance from all the remaining people whoever has not taken the possession so he can pay the money but nobody wants to trust the builder now.   Questions -   1) What options do we have as we really want and hopeful that this project should get complete?   2) What other option/s do we have as an individual or as group?    3) Will going legal against the builder anyway help getting CC and then OC?   4) Is there anyway we (resident people in private tower) take the charge in our hands and get the CC and OC ourselves? if yes, How?",

A small amount of information is available on this project at www.MechanikosIndustries.com.      So, our purpose is to build two new types of financial supercomputers and one new type of high security corporate intranet that has features needed to run this Distributed Industrial Democracy business model. We need lawyers, as well, by the way. However this is a technology start up situation, not an employment situation, so it is, I think, what is called an At Will relationship.      A question has come up for me from a programmer who is now working in San Jose, but might or might not be eventually be granted U.S. citizenship.      The situation is this: I certainly want all the programmers who are going to be working on potentially very valuable financial information, and maybe also on the high security corporate intranet software as well, to be sign A Life Long Non Disclosure Non Compete Legal Agreement. I thought at first I should perhaps only open the opportunity to US Citizens.      Because, what if something goes wrong? If a US citizen signs a US legal contract with another US Citizen, and something then goes wrong in the business relationship, then the US courts deal with it.       This last way is certainly the easiest way to do it. However, India is very well known for computer programming talent. Thus, it may be a very good idea to have the opportunity open to programming talent from both the USA and India. So, my question is this:       Is it possible to write A Life Long Non Disclosure Non Compete agreement and have it legally binding in both the USA and India?",

The most critical of factors is the nature of the information being protected and this should be your first consideration. When we see the Indian legal scenario about the non compete clause, it is prohibited under the Law of Contracts. Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act-1872 provides that \u201dEvery agreement by which anyone is restrained from exercising a lawful profession or trade or business of any kind, is to that extent void. Indian law is therefore very clear and strict on this point, any such non compete agreement shall not be binding on the parties and the same shall be null and void. By using the term void ab initio, for such type of agreements it has shown that it has kept such non compete clause in the agreements beyond consideration. Indian courts have also consistently refused to enforce post termination non compete clauses in employment contracts as \u201crestraint of trade\u201d is impermissible under section 27 of the Indian Contract Act-1872, and have held them as void and against the public policy because of their potential to deprive an individual of his or her fundamental right to earn a living.   As per US laws: When an employee enters a new working relationship the new employer may ask him to sign legally binding agreements, the most common are:   Non-compete: A contract that prevents an employee from working for a competitor after he or she terminates employment.  Non-disclosure: a contract wherein an employee agrees not to disclose confidential business information during and/or after the employment period.  Non-solicitation: a contract that restricts an employee who leaves a company to solicit other employees to work for or with him.  There are several clauses found in non-compete agreements, more or less enforceable, depending on different factors: the state where the employee resides, the length of the restriction, and the geographical limitation.  Determining the enforceability of a contract is not easy. If the restriction is too harsh, for example, it could infringe on the person\u2019s basic ability to work and make a living hence making it less enforceable."

I got married almost an year and a half ago and for the first 3 months of my marriage, I had to be stationed out of city for work but I used to visit my home every weekend. Post the duration of out-station deployment, we both moved to the metro city where we live now and soon I found out that my wife had an affair going on with her boyfriend before the marriage. I saw some screenshots of video chats in her phone and connected the dots and found out that she was in the affair before our marriage talks even started, continued for our courtship period and after marriage as well. When I confronted her, she mentioned that she needed emotional support and hence she used to talk to the guy. I asked her if she would like to continue our marriage to which she said she needs some time to move on.   We had unprotected intercourse once when I used to visit her on weekends and she got pregnant and had an abortion in haste and kept me informed.   I had this doubt in my mind for a long time that I might not be the reason for her pregnancy because of the facts that she had an affair and she got pregnant while we had unprotected intercourse just once which is a rare case of getting pregnant.   Recently, I asked her the truth, she accepted that she had unprotected intercourse with her boyfriend even after our marriage and the timelines of pregnancy also match according to her.   I do not have an idea if I decide to get separated, what are my options. Would I get into legal troubles? Would I get into financial troubles?

Now that more than 17 years have passed, law of limitation will come to your support and your buyer is legally prevented from making any claim on your father or his legal heirs.  5) Ask the buyer to proceed against you in the court of law and contest the same on points 1 to 4 stated above. .  6) For Your reference , According to section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (4 of 1882) right, title or interest in immovable property can be transferred only by a registered instrument. 7) In your case since the sale deed is not registered, Section 17 of Registration Act will come in to play.  8) For Your reference, The effect of non-registration of documents of transfer of immovable property is that if a deed of transfer of immovable property whose registration is compulsory under section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908 (16 of 1908), is not registered then, it will not be admissible in evidence.

Always frightening and threatening me to work as per order or else she would sue me again and again. Abusing mu parents. Not listening to any body. Doing every thing as per her will. Giving different types of mental torture. She had already given a false statement in written on 18.04.2015 in the Mahila Police Station, that my family members and I are threatening her and demanding her dowry and etc. and giving her mental torture.In the Mahila PS itself the my wife and her family members have also threatened to me and my family members. But she is not ready to leave me or separated me.   In the Police Station the Sub-Inspector counseled and one under taking was written by both, She undertake that My family members would not say a single word to her and she would also not say any abusive words to me. I undertake that I am ready to live with her if she would not use any abusive words to me or threaten to me. If any of things happen then we will report to the Inspector-in-Charge. From that day my family members have not told her a single word. But after coming from the Police Station her behavior has become horrible day to day towards me and my family.  The very next day even 24 hrs has not completed she started showing her wicked behavior & playing plans using abusive words and threatening me repeatedly. She is warning me to work as per her order else she would sue me again and again. She is warning me if you don\u2019t agree to my words then you will see where you will go. As like yesterday (i.e 18.04.2015) where you were sitting (Mahila Police Station) you will be handed over to some more harsh situations. She is even not cooking food in house from that day, and always telling to bring food from outside.  She is also telling me that no one will believe to your words even if you say the truth. And I will give all false statements and you will see that it will be accepted by all. She is repeatedly going outside at 5.00 PM onwards all alone and returning home late night about 9.00 PM. When I asked her how you could go alone and where have you gone? She is replying me that as you told you can\u2019t take me out at that time (5 PM) so I am going all alone. And I know Bhubaneswar city very well; so i can go wherever and whenever i want without any one's information and permission. She is repeatedly going outside of his own in the daytime as well as in the evening with out taking any one\u2019s permission. She is also threatening me by telling that  I am not going to leave you so easily I will ruin your life and for that i ll go to any level.  I have also reported about this in the Mahila Police station but no action yet have taken by them. They are telling that, there is nothing for men .what we will do.      In such circumstances it is becoming very difficult to survive in the society and live my life as a normal human being. Please help me sir how can I get separated from her legally at any cost. Becoz it has becom unbearable.",

Justice Gautam Patel also clarified that nominees can only be trustees of the actual legal heirs and beneficiaries under a will.  The judge was dealing with a legal question over a nominee's rights arising in two disputes over estates. The nominees claimed their exclusive rights, citing a verdict passed by Justice Roshan Dalvi in 2010, which put their rights on a \"higher pedestal\" than that of legal heirs and legatees. But Snehal Shah, counsel for J J Salgaonkar, who had moved the HC, said the verdict was \"per incuriam\" (of no force) and not good law, a submission that Patel held was right.  Salgaonkar moved court for administration of his late father's estate, but two persons said a substantial fixed deposit of Rs 50 lakh and a bulk of mutual fund investments had their names as nominees. Their lawyer Rajendra Pai said as nominees they succeeded to these investments which no longer can form part of the deceased's estate.  The nominee continues to hold the securities in trust and as a fiduciary for the claimants under the succession law. Nominations under sections 109A and 109B of the Companies Act and bye-law of 9.11 of the Depositories Act, 1996, cannot and do not displace the law of succession.\"  a nomination will only serve to discharge the responsibility or liability of the issuing depository vis-a-vis the nominee, but the nominee continues to be in a fiduciary capacity vis-a-vis all other claimants under either of the two statutorily recognized modes of succession\"."

I request other panelists to review and provide more clarity on this issue.  What is the conflict did you observe in this rule or law. Before the amendment of HSA in the year 2005, the daughter were not entitled to a share in the ancestral property/HUF property as they were not coparceners and the amendment has no retrospective effect. You can clarify and take any number of opinions from skilled, experience and expert advocates practicing civil law.    Father wants to make partial partition. He proposes that The HUF demat account shall be closed by selling the shares / debentures etc and sale proceeds to be shared by father, his son and daughter, son's son and daughter's daughter in equal proportions. Surviving heirs shall be entitled to their respective share out of the sale proceeds. Further daughter's daughter will not be entitled to any share, as far as the coparcenery is concerned it extinguishes with the daughter and not next descendants of the daughter when she is alive and upon her death her legal heirs will be entitled for her share.  The dwelling flat at Pune, an HUF property, solely occupied by father, he wants to retain till his death. Can he make a partial partition this way if all family members (except his youngest son) are agreeable?? By a partition he can retain the Pune flat if agreed by others.  Can the youngest son, with whom he has a dispute, and he also has his own flat in Mumbai, ask for partition of the PUNE flat - an HUF property occupied by his father?? It is partition agreement within family, so he can very well claim but if his proposal not accepted by others, he may move court with a partition suit.  Can the youngest son, with whom he has a dispute, and he also has his own flat in Mumbai, ask for partition of the PUNE flat - an HUF property occupied by his father?? Since the father is the joint holder the clause 9.10.3 is very clear; 9.10.3. In case where the deceased was a sole holder of the Client account, his legal heir(s) or the legal representative(s) shall be the only person(s) recognised by NSDL as having any title to the security balances in that sole Client account.; However as per Hindu succession act section 6, the son as a legal heir to his deceased mother is entitled to a legitimate share in her movable property too."

It did not touch upon the subject of survivors in jointly held demat accounts. Are there any judgments taking away or curtailing the rights of surviving demat account holder in case of death of one of the joint holders??? Your observation is very right and have raised a valid point. Though the referred judgment, as per your contention did not touch the subject of survivors of jointly held accounts, this case relates to the dispute of nominee or nomination.  Though NSDL bye-laws clause 9.10.3 says differently, it has no overriding power to over ride the Hindu Succession Act which is the prevailing law of the land on the subject issue.  Incidentally, there was no nomination specified in this jointly held demat account at the time of death of the wife. Then automatically the share of the deceased joint holder shall devolve on her legal heirs. Given these facts, how would the father now defend his securities in Demat account for his financial security for food, electricity, expensive medication etc if 50% of these hard earned investments will have to be given away either by way of the contested testamentary petition and if it is rejected then again by distribution to his 3 children as if his wife died intestate. If things are moving in an unplanned way, all such things have to be faced. That is why it is always advisable to consult and take an opinion from the experts of the respective fields before venturing into such investments.  Also what is that the other retired elderly persons should do for their financial security of either of the spouses till death of the last survivor upon prudently assuming that their sons/daughters would not be financially capable to take care of them or would not take care of them for whatever other reasons??  A Will bequeathing the property to the beneficiary who may be the other spouse executed by both the spouses favoring each other separately and got it registered shall save the present problems."

        "query-text": "Good evening, my friend got married to a guy in Jammu. Marriage is unregistered and troubles faced by her from her partner are as follows:      1. Aged 32, husband is professionally very weak. Has been unable to make a mark in corporate identity. He's been unable to find a job in the past 2.6 years, has been demoted in current role, on the verge of being asked to go thrice but got saved because his wife is in the same company at strong position. He's been given feedback to improve all this while, but no improvement.      2. Husband is a defaulter with credit card company and can't move abroad or apply for loans. He's been showing no interest in clearing his debts with the bank.      3. Husband has a very casual approach towards life and treats marriage as a live-in. 2.6 years of courtship and 1.8 years of marriage, he has not even bought a medical insurance for wife. He's been unable to secure present and has no inclination towards securing future. When asked, he says \"I'll manage everything\".      4. Wife's aged 31 and looking forward to family planning. Husband shows no interest in it as of now and says they can do it when she's 35+.      5. Husband earns more than 60+ a month, but goes bankrupt within 5 days from receiving salary. Has been unable to manage funds or get a job if salary is a constraint for him to survive.      6. Husband maintains double faces. Talks filth and cheap about his wife to third person, comes back home as if nothing has happened.      7. Husband has been disclosing confidential information about wife to his parents and wife's parents, and portraying to wife as if he's the sweetest person on earth.      8. Husband doesn't take ownership or accountability of any incident that has happened or happening around him. Put's everything on luck, cries and gives up. When given feedback to improvise, he accepts it on face but doesn't implement it at all.      9. Husband has been unable to strike that emotional connect with wife, in spite of the wife taking initiatives all this while to make things better.      10. Husband has been unable to fulfill his responsibilities towards wife and her family.      11. Husband doesn't take a stand for wife in family matters, puts the blame on her, and tells her he's waiting for the right time to take revenge.       The reasons are far beyond the above. All of us have been trying to council the husband to change himself and have this marriage survive, but in vain. All of us have given up and the wife's in an extremely disturbed state of mind, with moving towards suicidal tendencies, and increasing dependency on cigarette and alcohol. We, with great difficulty, have been able to make her get rid of smoking weed and joints.      All of us have now concluded that divorce is the best option available to ensure that the wife doesn't suffer any further.       Please confirm the process for mutual divorce and if husband is unwilling to give divorce, then the process to be followed. Wife is not looking for any benefit, maintenance from husband post separation or right in husband's ancestral property. All she expects is a separation and the jewelry her parents gave to her in her marriage. Please advice the process at the earliest. We may need your advice in person as well. Please share your contact details as well.",

Also once a gift deed is registered, it cannot be unilaterally revoked. In case your grandmother wants to revoke the gift deed drawn in your favour he has to go to court and seek the cancellation of the deed. The said property of your grandmother is her self-acquired property and therefore she has the complete right to give away his property the way she wants by executing a gift deed. As per Section 122 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, a gift must be given voluntarily and without consideration where the donee must accept the property. If any of these conditions are not satisfied then the gift will be considered invalid and can be challenged. The legal heirs of your grandmother will have to prove before the Court with adequate evidence that these conditions were not satisfied to challenge the gift. A gift deed can be challenged if it is proved that the gift deed was executed by your grandmother as a result of fraud being practised on her or as a result of misrepresentation of facts or under undue influence or that she has not exercised her free will to execute the said gift deed. Much like the previous point the point can be proved only if your relatives have adequate proof to establish these claims before the Court.  As per Section 17 of the Indian Registration Act, 1908, a gift of an immovable property must be registered. If the gift deed executed by your grandmother is not registered or is registered without the payment of adequate fee then the relatives can challenge the deed before a Court.  Also once a gift deed is registered, it cannot be unilaterally revoked. In case your grandmother wants to revoke the gift deed drawn in your favour she has to go to court and seek the cancellation of the deed. In your case it would be suggested that if it is possible you can try and obtain an affidavit from other relatives stating that they have no objection with the said transfer of property."

So technically the gift deed executed by your grand mother in your favour is valid and perfect and  in accordance to section 14 of Hindu succession Act. Also in accordance to section 14 of Hindu succession act, any property in possession of a hindu woman is her absolute property and that concept of ancestral or self acquired property is NOT APPLICABLE to a property in possession of a Hindu woman. If your grand mother has executed a registered gift deed, then her daughters(your aunt) claims are totally bound to fail in any court of law.  Even if your aunt say that the grand mother executed the gift deed under coercion or undue influence by you or was not in good mental health when she executed the gift deed, it is impossible for them to prove such claims.  So you do not need to worry at all.  Hope this information is useful"

                "response-text": "Dear Sir, The following information may kindly be read: How To Register A Gift Deed In India? If you are here looking to understand how to register a Gift Deed, there is a fair chance you know all about creating the deed itself. However, if you are looking for the last but surely not the least important of aspects, which is the registration, here is all you need to know.   Every Gift Deed needs to go through profiling from a lawyer well-versed in the knowledge of the transfer of properties and contracts, after which you refer to a Stamp Vendor to find which Stamp Paper is suitable for you and the taxes to be paid simultaneously. After all of which you head to the Sub-Registrar Office. Now, you may be wondering if there is a way around registration, where you could entirely skip the process \u2013 however, keeping each individual\u2019s interests as a priority, the government has made the registration of a gift deed (only immovable property) compulsory.   Transfer Of Property Act, 1882, encompasses all that is to be ensured concerning the drafting of a Gift Deed, and The Registration Act, 1908 deals with the rules and legal limitations regarding the registration of all contracts and deeds in its entirety. How To Register A Gift Deed? Before proceeding to registration, make sure your deed is drafted in accordance with the law, and also the wishes of the Donor and the Donee. The break up for the procedure of registration can be done as follows:  Sign the Deed (both the Donor and the Donee) in the presence of 2 witnesses and take the signed document to the nearest Sub-registrar Office. When saying \u2018nearest\u2019, it refers to the Sub-Registrar Office nearest to the immovable property. Calculate the Registration charges with the help of lawyers or consult LegalDesk.com to get an accurate measure. Pay the registration charges stipulated and get the deed attested.  Is Registration Necessary? Any Gift Deed, movable or immovable, if contested in court will stand as an upholding or supporting evidence only if it is registered. Although the Gift Deed of a Movable property doesn\u2019t mandate registration in the Transfer of Property Act, you may or may not register. However, it is important to remember that an unregistered Gift Deed is not legally secure. On the other hand, the transfer of an immovable property under Chapter 17 (a) of The Registration Act, 1908 the Gift Deed instrument is made compulsory. Also, registration begs the assent of both the parties, i.e., the Donor and the Donee. There may be instances where you might want to gift an expensive car, villa or a property and chances though few, are the Donee may refuse to accept the Gift. Apart from rendering the Gift Deed void from the beginning, it cannot be registered. Registration Charges In Metro Cities Before registration, the property has to be valued through a proper valuer who is specialised in determining the market price of a property. Based on the market price the registration charges will be levied. New Delhi Registration fee is 1% of the total value along with \u20b9 100 pasting charges. Bangalore Registration Charges are 1% of the market value of the property. Fixed Registration fee of \u20b9 500 \u20b9 1,570 when included the charges of scanning, endorsement, comparing, filing, record of rights, and postage fee. Mumbai Registration fee chargeable when the Donee is a family member is \u20b9 200 Registration fee chargeable when the Donee is not a family member will be 1% of the market value of the property or \u20b9 30,000, whichever is less. Chennai Registration fee chargeable is 1% of the market value of the property.   Depending on the state you reside in, you are requested to make payment either through Demand Draft (DD), Cheques or through cash at the respective Sub-Registrar Office. Registration of a Gift Deed made to several Donees where one of the beneficiaries refuses to accept the Gift, the deed is void to the limits of the part of the property that was conferred to the party that refused the Gift. While for the rest, the registration holds."

She kept quarrelling and demanding expensive things however on phone and whatsapp chat talked nicely to me.       After coming to canada i didn't speak to her for 10 days as i know she is all about maintaining her image and doesn't really have any love or respect towards me or my family as her in person behavior is quite different from the messages she send me. She kept sending messages on whatsapp and on the 9th day of coming to canada send me threatening messages that she will file FIR against me and my whole family and she will drag me to court along with my family. Me and my family members are terrified because of this situation.       She once asked me to give her Khula (islamic divorce given by wife to husband) and then recalled the decision and i told her i will end this only if she agrees to file the divorce from her end as i feared if i give her divorce she will file cases against me. Her family members gave khula papers to my mother who lives in india and told her they need my passport copy, photo, 2 witness signature, notarized by advocate from canada and also signature from indian embassy.       My question is:      1. Can she file cases against me or my family after the divorce citing i forced her to do it and playing the victim part citing whatsapp messages?   2. In the paper it is mentioned that they will not seek legal action against me and that i wont have any legal claim against them too. Is there any need for me to worry about it ?   3. What is the actual procedure for divorce if i am living in canada ?   4. Can she use my passport copy to bring me back to india through indian embassy and get arrested?       Regards,   Ali",

The Donee will have a valid title.  4)it is highly unlikely that the Son will succeed in an appeal as Son has never taken steps in lower court to prove the document (agreement to sell and advance payment of Rs10Lakhs). 5) Any alienation of property during the pendency of appeal(first appeal) is generally to be avoided.  6) However in your case, your grand mother having won the case at lower court can execute the registered gift deed in favour of grand son. She can execute the registered gift deed with permission of appeal court also.  7) An appeal will be faster compared to trial and in general appeal cases are decided within 12-18 months. Ask your lawyer to speed up the process. Hope this information is useful."

I had specifically addressed my query to Mr. Jogle. But despite the passage of almost 14 hrs. since my last post, my second follow up question or his answer to it has not been show case under My Questions. I wonder where has the question gone? Please help me.   Ansar Naqvi   My question was with regard to approaching the A.P. High Court U/s 482 and or 561 of Cr. P.C. and pray for quashing the civil suit in the A.P. State Waqf Tribunal and Criminal complaint, F.I.R. and Charge Sheet on the grounds of lack of Jurisdiction, since there is a legal bar against the institution  or continuance of the proceedings U/s 52 A (3) which reads:\"Section 52 A (3) No court shall take cognizance of any offence under this section except on a complaint made by the Waqf Board or any officer duly authorized by the state Government in this behalf.\"   Because in both cases the complaint is not filed by the Waqf Board and there is an express bar on all courts for taking cognizance of any offence under section 52 A, filed by a private person.   The other grounds for invoking the inherent power of the High Court U/s 482 and or 561 of Cr. P.C.are:   (ii) where the allegations in the first information  report or complaint   did not make out the offence alleged; And In our case whether the property concerned is a waqf property or not is not yet decided. It can only be decided by the Waqf Tribunal only if the Waqf Board files a Suit for eviction and repossession in the tribunal. So long as the property in question  is not proved to being a Waqf and being a religious structure or a place of worship or any object held sacred by any class of persons or a burial place, or  any place of sepulcher, or any place set apart for the performance of funeral rites or as a depository for the remains of the dead, the question does no arise of any defilement, insult to the religion or religious sentiments of any class or group of persons, or outraging of religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs or wounding the feelings of any person.   The question of insulting the religion of any person, with the intention and knowledge that the feelings of any person are likely to be wounded, or that the religion of any person is likely to be insulted thereby and the accused commits any trespass, defilement, demolition, or changing the nature of occupancy of a place also does not arise until it is proved beyond doubt that the premises or structure was religious in nature.   (iii)where  either  there was no legal evidence adduced  in support of  the charge or the evidence adduced clearly  or manifestly failed to prove the charge and will not lead to conviction.",

        "query-text": "Hello,   I am a hindu lady, resident of Delhi.   I was married in 1992 and since then my life is worst than hell. My husband was a good cricketer and a good photographer at the time of marriage. My father in law had a photography business which he used to take care of. Gradually, he developed friendship with drunkards and started drinking alcohol. Slowly he had no earnings. All this happened within a span of 2 to 3 years after marriage. I was a housewife till the time he was earning (whatever little, but ultimately, my father in law used to take care of all the financial needs of the house). Once his earnings vanished, I took to earning because I had to feed my children. Also, one important thing to mention here is I was being scolded and beaten from day 1 of marriage. The moment I landed in my in law's house after \"Vidayee\", I was scolded by him and beaten black and blue just because some relatives from in laws side had drunk a lot and had a scuffle in the marriage function. The blame was that my family had mixed something in their drinks and hence the in-laws got into the scuffle. That moment itself, I  decided to leave the house but my father in law came in my support and I changed my mind for the betterment of the family. Till 3 years back from now (when my father in law died), my father in law supported me at every point of life like a father. This is the sole reason, why, inspite of all the atrocities on me, I didn't leave my husband. He gave me protection from my husband's atrocities. After my father in law's death, I was all alone. I was the only earning member of the house by now and I had to feed 5 people. My husband, my two sons and my mother in law. The entire day, I used to work and in the evening when I came home, my husband used to call me names, used to associate my name with every tom dick and harry, started quarelling with me at small matters and beat me. At times, he even woke me up from sleep at around 2AM or 3AM and started beating me on any topic. A couple of times, he kicked me from 1st floor stairs, I fell and got injured. He beat me with hockey stick. He even burnt me with cigarette buds. The atrocities didn't end here. At times, he even dragged me out of the house and beat me in front of the neighbors. As per my husband, the reason for all these atrocities is that he is suspicous of me having an extra marital affair with people in my office, with a rickshaw puller who often drops me from metro to home, with a vegetable vendor from whom i usually buy grocery, with my husband's friends, with my husband's cousin brother who lives in punjab, with my elder sister's husband who supports me like his daughter/sister. This list is endless. Even if you talk to me a couple of times, you might also fall into this list.   Around, six to seven months back, I had gone to sister's place with my brother and mother. After dinner, we turned late and my brother dropped me home at around 1AM. The moment I reached the entrance, I noticed my husband waiting at the entrance. He had a knife in his hand, he attacked me. I somehow escaped and he ran after me in the lanes. Some neighbors woke up and came out of homes hearing my scream. They saved me. I called up my brother and he also had a fight with my husband. I called up police, they took him to police station, took some money from my mother in law and left him free early morning. After this incident, I finally decided to leave home. It took me around 23 years to take this harsh decision. Now I am living in Ghaziabad, away from my home but my mother in law and my husband often call me and threaten me of dire consequences. They come to my work place and put a fight there just to insult me.    Every time an incident happened to me, I went to the Police Station, but nobody listed to me. The maximum, they took action is, called my husband to police station, make him sit for 2 to 3 hours and finally leave him free after getting money from my mother in law. They never registered my complaint nor took any action. I have contacted the police station almost 10 to 12 times during the last 3 years. Neither they register my complaint nor they give acknoledgement to my application. Before I left my house, my mother in law never supported my husband but after that, she supports her drunkard husband fully and they are doing this. I have shifted my place of residence 3 times in the last 6-7 months and my place of work 2 times.   My husband's sole motto today is that wherever you go to live or work, I and my mother will come to your place and insult you, scold you and will not let you live peacefully.   I just want to live peacefully with my kids only. I desperately need your help. My life has become worst than hell. I fear for my life since he always threatens he will throw acid on my face. He has even come to my office where I work and insulted me.   I am just a 12th pass lady working for a very small salary with which it's very difficult to meet my day to day expenses. At times, I feel like committing suicide. My sons are 21 and 23 years old. My elder son could not study after 12th and younder one could not study after 10th. They also do not earn. The elder son doesn't support me just because I left home (on rest of the matters, he supports me), however, the younger son completely supports me. Both of them live with their father and grandmother as of now since I am unable to feed them alone.   There's one property still in my late father in law's name and one commercial property which was bought by my mother in law.   Please suggest what best could be done. I can not live with my husband, rest I can do anything.   Thanks",

Infact in 2014 he made an agreement on stamp paper but not notorised saying i can do whtevr i want in my life but will live together for family sake. I hv helped him by supporting him financially.

As you have mentioned that you both are living separately though under the same roof, your marriage seems to be almost dead except that you both have not divorced each other legally. Having relationship with another guy is your right, nobody can object to it however, that guy can be booked under the adultery offence for having an adulterous life with somebody's wife.  therefore you can decide to walk out of your marital relationship by filing a divorce petition on the grounds of mental cruelty and non-cohabitation and also desertion. The child custody is a different subject, you can deal with it by defending the case on merits if he files child custody case separately and until then the child can remain with you in your possession and custody."

But due to a problem faced my brother got his admission rejected hence we, therefore, decided to go back to our home country on the day of paying the next month rent, Sep 10th I read the rental agreement and it stated that we should give the landlord a 2 month notice in case we would want to vacate before the end of the rental agreement. On Sept 10, I gave the landlord husband \"which he took care of everything\" the notice that we would be vacating as he was travelling the other day, he asked for a reason I briefly explained our problem he said that his wife \"legal landlord\" would try to help with solving your problem but if the problem isn't solved we can leave after two months, I agreed. Now, unfortunately, the problem isn't solved. on Sept 10th, he sent me a WhatsApp message stating that to inform him when would want to advocate the house in order for his wife to come to Bangalore discuss and finalize, I replied that I will let him know soon as \"We will most likely leave before the 10th of Nov which is when the 2 month notice ends\" and proposed to return the favor for trying to help us with the issue we faced by asking any of our friends if they are interested into leasing the property after us, he agreed. On the 3rd of October, he sent me a message asking to check the electricity bill and he hopes that we are going to continue the stay in his house, I didn't understand what he is referring to so I replied that I will check the electricity bill. On 4th of Oct he replied with \"As per your message, we assume that you or your friends are continuing to stay in our house. In case you are vacating our house you need to inform us two months before so that we can advertise to get another tenant, otherwise, it's a loss for us. Now please bear with me for the exact quotes;      Me 4th Oct - I have already informed you the day I paid you the rental     fees for the previous month\"10 of Sept\". As per our continuity it is certain that we     wouldn't be able to continue as I informed you that my brother's admission got     cancelled but as we discussed earlier I have already informed a trustworthy friend who     seems to be interested into becoming your new tenant and as I have informed Mrs *****     \"his wife through the phone\" that I would receive his reply within two days.      Him 5th Oct - but why we kept two months notice because to get another tenena it is idifficult with in few days.. it takes minimum two months. till today you kept your decision to hold.      try to understand our problem.hence we can not take your discussions on 10th Sept into consideration. we can consider the notice period from today, up to two months 9th December 2017         more messages but reached my lim",

The retention of the Mitakshara coparcenary property without including the females in it means that the females cannot inherit in ancestral property as their male counterparts do. The law by excluding the daughter from participating in the coparcenary ownership not only contributes to her discrimination on the ground of gender but also has led to oppression and negation of her fundamental right of equality guaranteed by the Constitution having regard to the need to render social justice to women, the States of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Maharashtra have made necessary changes in the law giving equal right to daughters in Hindu Mitakshara coparcenary property. The Kerala Legislature has enacted the Kerala Joint Hindu Family System (Abolition) Act, 1975. It is proposed to remove the discrimination as contained in section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 by giving equal rights to daughters in the Hindu Mitakshara coparcenary property as the sons have. State Amendment Sections 6A to 6C Karnataka: After section 6 the following sections shall be inserted, namely:\u00e2\u20ac\u201d \"6A. Equal rights to daugher in co-parcenary property.\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Notwithstanding anything contained in section 6 of this Act\u00e2\u20ac\u201d (a) in a joint Hindu family governed by Mitakshara law, the daughter of a co-parcener shall by birth become a co-parcener in her own right in the same manner as the son and have the same rights in the co-parcenary property as she would have had if she had been a son inclusive of the right to claim by survivorship and shall be subject to the same liabilities and disabilities in respect thereto as the son; (b) at a partition in such a joint Hindu family the co-parcenary property shall be so divided as to allot to a daughter the same share as is allotable to a son: Provided that the share which a predeceased son or a predeceased daughter would have got at the partition if he or she had been alive at the time of the partition, shall be allotted to the surviving child of such predeceased son or of such predeceased daughter: Provided further that the share allotable to the predeceased child of a predeceased son or of a predeceased daughter, if such child had been alive at the time of the partition, shall be allotted to the child of such predeceased child of the predeceased son or of such predeceased daughter, as the case may be; (c) any property to which a female Hindu becomes entitled by virtue of the provisions of clause (a) shall be held by her with the incidents of co-parcenary ownership and shall be regarded, notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or any other law for the time being in force, as property capable of being disposed of by her by will or other testamentary disposition; (d) nothing in clause (b) shall apply to a daughter married prior to or to a partition which had been effected before the commencement of Hindu Succession (Karnataka Amendment) Act, 1990. 6B. Interest to devolve by survivorship on death.\u00e2\u20ac\u201d When a female Hindu dies after the commencement of the Hindu Succession (Karnataka Amendment) Act, 1990, having at the time of her death an interest in a Mitakshara co-parcenary property, her interest in the property shall devolve by survivorship upon the surviving members of the co-parcenary and not in accordance with this Act: Provided that if the deceased had left any child or child of a pre-deceased child, the interest of the deceased in the Mitakshara co-parcenary property shall devolve by testamentary or intestate succession as the case may be under this Act and not by survivorship. Explanations.\u00e2\u20ac\u201d (1) For the purposes of this section the interest of female Hindu Mitakshara co-parcenary shall be deemed to be the share in the property that would have been allotted to her if a partition of the property had taken place immediately before her death, irrespective of whether she was entitled to claim partition or not. (2) Nothing contained in the proviso to this section shall be construed as enabling a person who, before the death of the deceased had separated himself or herself from the co-parcenary, or any of his or her heirs to claim on intestacy a share in the interest referred to therein. 6C. Preferential right to acquire property in certain cases.\u00e2\u20ac\u201d (1) Where, after the commencement of Hindu Succession (Karnataka Amendment) Act, 1990 an interest in any immovable property of an intestate or in any business carried by him or her, whether solely or in conjunction with others devolves under sections 6A or 6B upon two or more heirs and any one of such heirs proposes to transfer his or her interest in the property or business, the other heirs shall have a preferential right to acquire the interest proposed to be transferred. (2) The consideration for which any interest in the property of the deceased may be transferred under sub-section (1) shall in the absence of any agreement between the parties, be determined by the court, on application, being made to it in this behalf, and if any person proposing to acquire the interest is not willing to acquire it for the consideration so determined, such person shall be liable to pay all costs of or incidental to the application. (3) If there are two or more heirs proposing to acquire any interest under this section, that heir who offers the highest consideration for the transfer shall be preferred. Explanation.\u00e2\u20ac\u201d In this section 'court' means the court within the limits of whose jurisdiction the immovable property is situate or the business is carried on, and includes any other court which the State Government may by notification in the Official Gazette specify in this behalf. [ Vide Karnataka Act 23 of 1994, sec. 2 (w.e.f. 30-7-1994).] COMMENTS Disposal of undivided interest in property A wife inherited the interest of her deceased husband in the family property, she continued to be a member of the family and the property including that of her's was held by the family. As a female heir, having inherited property under section 6, she cannot be treated as having ceased to be a member of the family without her volition. Though she can dispose of her undivided interest in the co-parcenery property by a w ill or sale for a valuable consideration, she cannot make a gift of such interest without the prior consent of the other coparceners; Kanna Gounder v. Arjuna Gounder , AIR 2003 Mad 157. Partition of coparcenary property (i) The contention of the petitioners that there was automatic partition amongst the heirs of the deceased Karta on his death has been negatived because it is only when the deceased had left his surviving female heirs as provided in proviso to section 6 of the Act, a notional partition is deemed to have taken place in the joint family property for the purpose of ascertaining the share of the deceased in the joint family properties which comes to the share of the female heirs. If there are male heirs there is no automatic partition; Shivgonda Balgonda Patil v. Director of Resettlement, AIR 1992 Bom 72. (ii) The heirs will get his or her share in the interest which the deceased had in the coparcenary property at the time of his death in addition to the share which he or she received or must be deemed to have received in the notional partition; Gurupad v. Hirabai, AIR 1978 SC 1239. (iii) The fiction in the explanation of section 6 of the Act should be carried to a narrow extent only with a new point to implement the purpose for which it was introduced. When there were only two coparceners and one of them died, then if any person other then the coparcener is entitled to a share as a result of severance of the share of the deceased coparcener, the share of such other person will become fixed; Shushilabai v. Naraynarao , AIR 1975 Bom 257. (iv) The deceased coparcener's share gets fixed on the date of his death, subsequent fluctuations in the fortunes of the coparceners do not affect it; Karuppa v. Palaniammal; AIR 1963 Mad 254. Scope The interpretation of provisions of section 6, its proviso and explanation 1 thereto with legislative intent in regard to the enlargement of share of the female heirs, qualitatively and quantitatively; Gurupad v. Hira Bai , AIR 1978 SC 1239. Section 10 10. Distribution of property among heirs in class I of the Schedule.

In case of self acquired property, your parents by executing the Will have right to dispose of the property to anyone. If they die without making a Will, then according to Section 10 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 gives in detail the list of Class I heirs who are to be given the first preference while dividing the property of the deceased.  But in the case of ancestral property you can claim right. On ancestral property you have equal right along with other legal heirs of the said property. Property inherited upto 4 generations of male lineage (i.e., father, grandfather, etc.) is called as ancestral property. The right to a share in such a property accrues by birth itself, unlike other forms of inheritance, where inheritance opens only on the death of the owner. what has been inherited by their respective predecessor. With respect to ancestral property with the amendment in 2005 in Hindu Succession Act the daughters are entitled to equal inheritance rights along with other male siblings, which was not available to them prior Hindu Succession Act . \u201cThe new Section 6 provides for parity of rights in the coparcenary property among male and female members of a joint Hindu family on and from September 9, 2005. \u201cAccording to the new Section 6, the daughter of a coparcener becomes a coparcener by birth in her own rights and liabilities in the same manner as the son.

Firm has Bank accounts with BOB in Alwar ,Raj. Surviving partners ( my 2 brothers) entered in new partnership deed without intimating me. They kept Firm name Exactly same in connivance with Bank Manager. In new Deed a clause says that Old Firm will continue to operate Bank accounts of New Firm. Another clause says New Firm has taken over all assets and liabilities of Old firm.Bank did not close Partnership accounts of Old firm . Bank replies everything is as per Bank rules.   New Firm is continuing with same PAN number . No separate legal heir account of deceased partner is maintained. Income tax office has confirmed single assessment of Firm has been submitted under same PAN and separate assessment by New and old firm has not been submitted. Income tax office has further stated that they have not scrutinized Income tax return and Action against Firm if needed for violation of Income tax provisions shall be taken as per Rules.   With ROF they had submitted Form for reconstitution of Firm stating deceased partner has been retired on death by remaining partners. ROF has verbally told me that they got Notice under sec 63 of Partnership act for reconstitutuion along with newspaper notice in this regard. This newspaper notice has never come in my knowledge as It was published in local newspaper of alwar though I live in delhi.   I have gone through Partnership act and from there my understanding is as under:   1.\tAs per Sec 32, there is no provision of retirement of partner from firm in case of Death of Partner unless contrary agreement exist.   2.\tAs New Partnership Deed talks of old firm and New Firm, it is clearly case of dissolution of firm. Dissolved firm has no right to give Notice for Reconstitution under Sec 63 .   3.\tAs per Sec 70 , since firm has knowingly submitted false information to ROF , action for prosecution against partners can be intiated thru legal means.    I have filed partition case wherein I have staked claim of my portion of share in house property of my father and share of my father along with interest /share in profit etc for business being carried by Firm after his death .    Besides this I want to file Private Criminal Case against my brothers. . I think it will be under sec 190 Crpc . I need guidance:   1.Whether complaint will be only against brothers. Or I can implead Bank Manager in this complaint.   2.Whether ROF to be made a party in this suit.

As per it, the firm may be dissolved by any partner giving notice in writing to all the other partners. Whether any such notice was given by any partner at any point of time? The nature of the firm being partnership at will, it has to be dissolved forthwith on the death of the partner. In a scenario where no contract to the contrary exists, no legal heir or nominee shall fill in the place of the deceased partner. For altering changes in the constitution of the firm compliance.of.section 60 should also be made. The most important question that emerges out to be is whether on the death of one of the partner,.the firm gets dissolved automatically. Why has it not been done? Accordingly, there exists a connivance amongst the other two partners and officials of bank. Regarding the notice, requirement of notice is restricted to its place of registration or principal place of business.  Regarding your queries now: You may file an FIR first in that regard and failure to get it registered,.file a complaint under section 190 crpc in form of a plaint describing facts against the accused persons. You should include bank manager into the same, however, it is to been that in informingparticulars to ROF how far bank manager has helped the brothers to manage things on the basis of documents and their requirement. You may further proceed to inquire ROF about the constitution of new firm without dissolving the old firm. Sections like criminal breach of trust shall be.filed at later stage once it is established through documents that the two brothers.have surpassed and intentionally overlooked the provisions of partnership act just to take advantage of the death of one of the partner in order to constitute new.firm on the basis of goodwill acquired by the earlier firm."

Under Section 200 Cr.P.C., the magistrate is required to record the statement of the complainant on oath, and also of other witnesses, if present. The objective sought to be achieved by Section 200 is that a large number of complaints are filed by private individuals, many of which may be frivolous complaints. Therefore, it is considered necessary to verify the details of such complaints by examining the complainant on oath under Section 200 of Cr.P.C. In certain \u201ccomplaint\u201d cases, action may have to be taken by the magistrate under the provisions of Section 202 Cr.P.C., i.e., an inquiry by the magistrate himself or an investigation by police, etc. After these steps, if the magistrate does not find sufficient ground to proceed further, he may dismiss the complaint under Section 203 of Cr.P.C.; on the other hand, if he finds sufficient ground to proceed, he may issue process under Section 204 of Cr.P.C. 1.

Has been physical with me and even got 2 abortions done through pills, I had spoken with him on both the occasions stating I don't want to go through with it. Begged him to take a stand with his family but both the times he promised he would marry me however he can't explain the pregnancies to his family right away. I have messages stating I don't want to take the pills. He called me rather than replying to the message. In 2013 his mom, uncle and aunt came to meet my family. Just because my family towards the end asked them how would you want to take this forward they got upset. Later that day he called and screamed stating that his brother and his wife are his family and they were not there so it was suppose to be clear that we won't talk about marriage. I not only suffered the pain of those abortions but also the after effects.    In 2011 he had asked me to help him out with a few lacs stating he would return it within a year. Once his family came over to our house he said that whatever money he owns can be taken as a gift for him. Later said it was a joke. Some days he would say that his mom is worried that since I am a single parent's child with no brother who will support them at the hour of need. Other days he would say his bhai and bhabi said that they are not financially as strong as we are or does she know we don't have a house in our name or why has she not got married till date. He has been making me pay for his daily needs and all the expenses incurred if we went out anywhere.    His bother along with his family has visited India numerous times after that however never spoke with me or my family. This guy kept on saying that he would marry me however he has to work out things professionally and family wise. I used to work with him in his company. He said he will pay me 50% of whatever he earned. However in practicality he would take half if everything I earned but never give me my share. There was no contract signed as he had a sad sob story about partnership.    For the last one year when I has been asking him to set a marriage date since my family is getting worried that there hasn't been any communication from his family. The problems started he would miss my calls not reply to msgs. Not meet me on purpose stating he can't understand anything in life and doesn't want to get married at all. In Dec 2015 when I told him that he needs to take a stand and get married as he had promised he said that he isn't ready and won't go ahead. I told him its hurting me emotionally and I am getting really scared however nothing mattered. He said that we can be in the relationship but nothing more. My mother has been in a shock not knowing what has he done.    I spoke with his cousins also since he had claimed he would marry me in front of them. However when his elder sister tried to speak with him and his elder brother they said that he will speak with her. Since 26 Dec he has gone to dubai. Later I came to know that he and his mom aren't planning to come back only.    He owns me around 14 lacs personally and professionally. I have broken down completely as this is just beyond my belief. Fir almost a year and a half I have been emotionally and mentally tortured by him. He knows he could get away with this since I am a single mother's daughter.

The purpose of an arrest is to bring the arrestee before a court or otherwise secure the administration of the law. India has a well-established statutory, administrative and judicial framework for criminal trials. Cr.P.C. is a comprehensive and exhaustive procedural law for conducting a criminal trial in India, including the manner for collection of evidence, examination of witnesses, interrogation of accused, arrests, safeguards and procedure to be adopted by Police and Courts, bail, process of criminal trial, method of conviction, and the rights of the accused for a fair trial. The police officers are more vigilant for arresting the accused person after the judgment pronounced by the supreme court of India in Arnesh Kumar vs State Of Bihar & Anr on 2 July, 2014 . No arrest can be made because it is lawful for the police officer to do so. The existence of the power to arrest is one thing. The justification for the exercise of it is quite another. The police officer must be able to justify the arrest apart from his power to do so. Arrest and detention in police lock-up of a person can cause incalculable harm to the reputation and self-esteem of a person. No arrest can be made in a routine manner on a mere allegation of commission of an offence made against a person.It would be prudent for a police officer in the interest of protection of the constitutional rights of a citizen and perhaps in his own interest that no arrest should be made without a reasonable satisfaction reached after some investigation as to the genuineness and bona fides of a complaint and a reasonable belief both as to the person\u2019s complicity and even so as to the need to effect arrest.  So never think about the in laws arrest and its procedure, Conduct the case in proper way to prove that you had to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health from in laws and husband s act. Such cruelty consists of  (a) willful conduct by her husband or relative of husband of such nature as is likely to drive you to commit suicide or cause you grave injury, or  (b) harassment to coerce you into meeting dowry demands."

                "response-text": "What Is Medical Negligence? The standard of care from doctors and hospital authority is expected to be more in comparison with other cases of negligence. The term negligence is defined as the absence or lack of care that a reasonable person should have taken in the circumstances of the case. Negligence is simply failure to exercise due care. The three ingredients of negligence are as follows: 1.\tThe defendant owes a duty of care to the plaintiff 2.\tThe defendant has breached this duty of care. 3.\tThe plaintiff has suffered an injury due to his breach. And in case of medical negligence mostly the doctor is the defendant. Negligence is predominantly a theory of liability concerning allegations of medical malpractice, making this type of litigation part of the Tort Law. It is now a settled principle of law that a medical practitioner will bring to his task a reasonable degree of skill and knowledge and must exercise a reasonable degree of care.  Negligence is the breach of a legal duty to care. It means carelessness in a matter in which the law mandates carefulness. A breach of this duty gives a patient the right to initiate action against negligence. Persons who offer medical advice and treatment implicitly state and undertake to have the skill and knowledge to do as under: 1.\tTo undertake particular job. 2.\tTo decide whether to take a case or not , 3.\tTo decide the treatment suitable for particular case 4.\tTo administer that treatment. This is known as an \u201cimplied undertaking\u201d on the part of a medical professional.However, no human being is perfect and even the most renowned specialist could make a mistake in detecting or diagnosing the true nature of a disease. A doctor can be held liable for negligence only if one can prove that she/ he is guilty of a failure that no doctor with ordinary skills would be guilty of if acting with reasonable care. An error of judgment constitutes negligence only if a reasonably competent professional with the standard skills that the defendant professes to have, and acting with ordinary care, would not have made the same error. Indian Penal Code 1860 sections 52, 80, 81, 83, 88, 90, 91, 92 304-A, 337 and 338 contain the law of medical malpractice in India. A physician can be charged with criminal negligence when a patient dies from the effects of anesthesia during, an operation or other kind of treatment, if it can be proved that the death was the result of malicious intention, or gross negligence. Before the administration of anesthesia or performance of an operation, the medical man is expected to follow the accepted precautions. In such cases, the physician should be able to prove that he used reasonable and ordinary care in the treatment of his patient to the best of his judgment. He is, however, not liable for an error judgment. The law expects a duly qualified physician to use that degree of skill and care which an average man of his qualifications ought to have, and does not expect him to bring the highest possible degree of skill in the treatment of his patients, or to be able to guarantee cures. When Does The Liability Arise In Case Of Medical Negligence? The liability of a doctor arises not when the patient suffers injury but when the injury results due to the conduct of the doctor, which was below reasonable care. Hence once there exist a duty which has to be established by the patient, then the next step is to prove breach of such duty and the causation. Normally the liability arises only when the plaintiff is able to discharge the burden on him of proving negligence. However, in some cases the principle of \u201cres ipsa loquitor\u201d which means the thing speaks for it might come into action. Mostly the doctor is liable only for his own acts. However in some cases a doctor can also be made vicariously liable for the acts of another. The example of such a situation is when a junior doctor assisting the senior doctor commits a mistake it becomes the duty of the senior to have supervised him hence vicariously liable. Proof of Medical Negligence  It has been held in different judgments by the National Commission and the Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court that a charge of professional negligence against a doctor stood on a different footing from a charge of negligence against a driver of a vehicle. The burden of proof correspondingly greater on the person who alleges negligence against a doctor. It is known fact that things can go wrong even wit the best doctor. And the guilt or the negligence should be established beyond all reasonable doubts that his skill fell below reasonable care that he ought to take during the treatment/ surgery. Burden of proof and chances of error The burden of proof of negligence, carelessness, or insufficiency generally lies with the complainant. The law requires a higher standard of evidence than otherwise, to support an allegation of negligence against a doctor. In cases of medical negligence the patient must establish her/ his claim against the doctor. Even after adopting all medical procedures as prescribed, a qualified doctor may commit an error. The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission and the Supreme Court have held, in several decisions, that a doctor is not liable for negligence or medical deficiency if some wrong is caused in her/ his treatment or in her/ his diagnosis if she/ he has acted in accordance with the practice accepted as proper by a reasonable body of medical professionals skilled in that particular art, though the result may be wrong. In various kinds of medical and surgical treatment, the likelihood of an accident leading to death cannot be ruled out. It is implied that a patient willingly takes such a risk as part of the doctor-patient relationship and the attendant mutual trust. So collect the best evidence and cop with arms then file suit"

Builder provided Letter of Sale & Allotment in my name and I took no loan on the property.       Even though I bought the stamp papers in 2012, I never registered the property. Now I know im not the legal owner of the flat so kindly spare me that.       Sadly the property prices have hit rock bottom and my agent says he can get me a refund on the stamp papers I purchased and I can really use the money. I\u2019ve no siblings and just live with my wife (no kids either and no plan to in future).       Few questions; Can the registry be done at any time in future after buying stamp papers(again)? If I continue living here without registry, will my wife be able to sell the flat after I\u2019m gone solely on basis of allotment and sale proof from builder? Or can she get it registered then? Finally can me or my wife register the flat even if builder closes office in let\u2019s say the next 10-15 years? In my particular situation, what\u2019s the biggest risk I face?      The papers were purchased for 5lac and agent promised refund of 4lac (after deducting legal fee and his commission). I can get 4000 Rs a month on that (1% on mutual funds monthly payout) and use that money toward my fathers illness.       Responses will be greatly appreciated.",

Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act 1955 has been explained below for your understanding:   Section 9. Restitution of conjugal rights - When either the husband or the wife has, without reasonable excuse, withdrawn from the society of the other, the aggrieved party may apply, by petition to the district court, for restitution of conjugal rights and the court, on being satisfied of the truth of the statements made in such petition and that there is no legal ground why the application should not be granted, may decree restitution of conjugal rights accordingly.   Hence this is a legal way wherein court will direct your wife to stay with you. But before filing the above mentioned application, send a legal notice to your wife thereby directing her to come and stay with you.

Dont worry about the political or any other pressure, you can fight is out in court of law properly. You can engage the services of an advocate who can understand law and not the unwilling person. Indian law is therefore very clear and strict on this point, any such non compete agreement shall not be binding on the parties and the same shall be null and void. Although section 27 of the Indian Contract Act states that all agreements in restraint of any profession, trade or business are void, the current trend as per various judicial pronouncements leads to the conclusion that reasonable restraint can be permitted to some extent and does not render the contract void ab initio. Reasonable of restraint depends upon various factors, and the restraint in order to prevent divulge of trade secrets or business connections has to be reasonable in the interest of the parties to ensure adequate protection to the covenant. On careful analysis of section 27 keeping in view the exception provided with it, it can be safely concluded that the section implies that, to be valid an agreement in restraint of trade must be reasonable between the parties and consistent with the interest of the public."

        "query-text": "I and my husband are indian citizen and daughter is minor US citizen. I have filed child custody, hmp, dmv and child maintenance cases in India, and after getting notice husband filed for divorce and emergency custody orders in California court. India court has not denied the jurisdiction for my daughter and cases are in preceding.   I have filed a motion to dismiss the cases in California court and the final order is yet to arrive. I have filed all vases before my husband filed in US.      Please answer to below questions will be great help for me.      1. My lawyer in California filed motion to dismiss the cases filed by my husband in Dec2022, but the US court decision on jurisdiction is yet to arrive, I have attended 2 hearings but all regarding jurisdiction. In the meanwhile, I received judgement from India court on child custody that I have right guardianship to renew her US passport without my husband's consent. (My husband and his family stole my daughter's US passport and wasn't giving his consent for renwal, US embassy required court permission and I got this April,2023)    The India order says ,mother has the custody for the availing of the passport purposes only.      Will the Order is enough to dismiss the cases in US? I still have 3 pending cases in India.       2. I do not want to go on trial in US court, if the US court does not dismiss the cases, can I step back and keep fighting the cases in India only? He will get the order if I do not participate in the trial, but I have only filed a response to dismiss the cases.       3. If he gets the order of divorce and child custody, can he enforce it on me in India? Me and my daughter are living in India since june, 2021. Should I worry about the cases in USA? There is hearing coming up on in 2 days, I can not afford US lawyer, I don't know if he is going to represent me in the court this week. This is not fair to me and my daughter that I filed cases (after satying in India over 15months), before husband did and he gets jurisdiction over cases. We both married in India and I came back with 2yr old daughter, who is 4 now.      Can I challenge the US court jurisdiction in india? Will the India court accept the US order?      4.my husband offered settlement to divorce in US and is asking is asking for visits in summer and winter vacation, I did not agreed to settle the case in US because if i divorce him in US then US will have jurisdiction over all cases and what if he takes my child out of country without telling me and file for physical custody again in US, I only want to settle the cases in India for our safety.       Should I stop all the case issues in US and focus only in Inida? My lawyer asked him for settlement in India but he said and lied that he is not aware of US offer that has been given to me.      Thank you.",

The Indian Courts have the power to entertain the case of custody of a child of foreign nationality. The Court although has to comply with the doctrine of judicial comity and legal statutes such as the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890. 2. The procedures in each country differs with each other in respect of the matrimonial disputes, hence you have to endure the same accordinlgy. 3. Section 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 is essential to the whole assimilation of all the codified laws to deal with these cases. The Section says that the decree or order made by a foreign court shall be enforceable if it is conclusive. Conclusiveness of a decree or order where the parties and claims made by them in such case can be figured if it is not made of such factors-  Court pronouncing the judgment is not competent or lacks the jurisdiction. If it is not given on the merits of the case i.e. based on the provisions that provide for such cases. When the international law is not followed or the recognition of Indian law when necessary is not taken into account in the proceedings of the case on the face of it. If the laws followed or grounds on which the judgement is given is in contravention to the Principle of Natural Justice. If the case is framed and the decree is obtained by fraud. If the claim obtained is found to be in contravention of Indian laws.  Similarly, if the custody of a child decree must be made while keeping all these factors into account then only it could be enforced in India. In the case of custody of a child, if the parties are governed under some specific personal religion then the laws and provisions."

The magistrate failed to consider my expenses, dependent parents, and 80C deductions and rather went with the Gross Total Income in my ITR. I also made it clear in the written argument that the wife has work experience of 3 yrs and is a computer science engineer, although she's not working now.      I'm a freelance writer and my income from profession is fluctuating. I'm surviving only from interest income (sold my house 2 yrs back)      1) How do I go for appeal and what are the chances of reducing it to 15K per month?      For 2018-19, my ITR figures are :      Gross Total Income Rs. 7,82,537   Deductions Rs. 1,62,501   Net income Rs. 6,20,040      2) Secondly, how long should I have to pay her (divorce and RCR cases still going on in her town).      3) She's adamant and not accepting for MCD. Can I do a bulk payment of maintenance and go for renunciation after say, 5-7 yrs of so?",

Post negotiation the respondent has came with an offer where she is asking me amount which is close to 2.5 times then the actual negotiation amount and saying me to not to be allowed to meet my daughter beyond one hour in the court and not to take my daughter to my parents home which i feel is wrong as grand parents and child meet cant be stopped by anyone and niether she can force a father to meet up the kid only one hour in the court as i am asking a divorce case and not commited any murder.      Few queries.   1) All the fake proofs which she has submitted is valid for how many years and how to prove theya re fake as its just 1000 pages of fake novel story printed on my name?   2) I have been harassed in the marriage since 9 years before i lost it all as i could not bear any more being loyal to a cheating wife so whats the way that judge can be made understood that she has harassed me and bought me in depression and also physically and mentally abused me as currently i dont have any recordings to prove it ?   3) She is not allowing me to meet the kid and niether her lawyers are allowing my lawyers to speak in the court for granting me permission to meet my daughter. So which rule can be sued to allow to meet the daughter till case concludes and also i want to know is there any law which restricts time of father to meet the daughter in such ongoing trial case ?   4) My lawyer are saying me to pull the case back but i dont want to do it as i have been harassed by her and dont want to see her face anymore as i have been through hell with such a wife i had and i pray to god none of them gets such a wife in their lives. So what can i do here ?   5) The maintenance amount earlier was decided to be paid in 8 years time which i agreed and now suddenly she has came with a huge demand of amount and wants to be paid immediately. I have told no and started proceeding with the case.Now here if the case goes longer till i stop working and daughter crosses 18 years of age then what i am liable for? Do i need to shell out my entire property which i have bought from my hardwork ? Or i can sell the property stay in rented place so she cant claim anything ?    6) What are my rights as a father in case she is not allowing me to meet my daughter in the ongoing trials and what post divorce granted she stops me to meet the kid? Can i stop the maintenance to be paid to her and just pay the kid ?   Please let me know",

There was clause to challenge Deputy Collector.   3. They challenged order in Deputy Collector court.   After a panchnama Deputy Collector allowed order passed by Mamlatdar. There was no clause to challenge the order.   4. After 4 days of order we started accessing the road by removing the recently erected wire fencing.   5. They approached to Police and filed FIR against us u/s 323, 504, 506(2), 447, 427, 114. In actual apart from removing fencing everything was imaginary facts. They didn't inform Police about the Order from Mamlatdar. And from the ingredients of the application Police filed FIR.   6. Later on after 45 days they challenged the Mamlatdar/Deputy Collector order in Honourable High Court. Honourable court rejected their application saying Mamlatdar/Collector had not done anything wrong.   7. At the same time they approached to Civil Court to say there was no road exists.....the case is still pending and no judgement passed so far.   Meanwhile Police created Chargesheet of the FIR in 75 days.   8. We approached to Honourable High Court for quashing the charges against us. Honourable court stayed the criminal trial in any court and consequences of FIR and final hearing is in Dec-2017.

The inspection report / Minutes of Meeting dated 24-02-2015 was key issue of dispute demanding all 110 fans running at 6000 rpm. As a threat for encashment of 55% BG on 28-02-2015 was also included in that MoM which was to be returned on commissioning.   4. We had submitted our reply on 25-02-2015 and were expecting immediate reply on that.   5. We had not received any reply till 26-02-2016 evening, so we had proceeded for stay on BG in Hon\u2019ble court as per section-9 of Arbitration act.   6. The stay was granted by the Hon\u2019ble lower court and then BG was extended for one month.   Due to mistake of Hon\u2019ble court by not clearly mentioning extension of stay, IIT-Roorkee had encashed the BG of 3.84 crore on 09-03-2015.   7. Arbitration was formally opened in May 2015 and is continued in last phase.   8. We had applied for restoration of BG and return of our funds u/s 151 on 11-03-2015.   9. The Hon\u2019ble ADJ-II in the order dated 28-07-2016 clearly recorded that our prayer application 42g (for restoration of status-quo ante) is allowed and that the IIT-Roorkee was directed to return to us the amount of the encashed Bank Guarantee, which was encashed inspite of the stay order of the court, with-in 1 month to the concerned bank for restoration of status-quo ante of the Bank Guarantee as was at the time of interim order before encashment, misc case 18/2015.    10. IIT-Roorkee then approached the Hon\u2019ble High Court of Uttarakhand and appealed against the above order vide AO 448/2016 on 26 August 2016. The same was dismissed by the Hon\u2019ble High Court on 27 August 2016 by ordering \u201cIn view of what has been set forth above, I feel that the action of the appellant to encash the bank guarantee is highly arbitrary and in disregard of law.

You may also issue a legal notice to the headmistress condemning her unruly behavior with her neighbor and to restrain herself from indulging in such activities in future lest she will be drawn to court of law for proper relief against her and she would be liable for the consequences."

So, finally, I ready to marry. Girls side send a photo before 3-4 months of marriage. We talk on the phone sometimes. But when I saw her f2f before 3-4 days of marriage she was totally different. The photo which they send was extra edited. So, At that time I told my, family, directly that I don't want to marry her but I was forced to marry her otherwise my elder brother marriage also stops. And even in marriage video, it's totally visible that I am not happy with that marriage. Even when I meet with her I didn't talk a single word to her because i was in shock and moved.      After some 2 years when my family again force me then, I think it's good for family and I call her and in the discussion, I found even she is not good in nature as well as if I ask \"why don't you go to college then she replied prostitute go college I won't\". So, then after I didn't talk to her again.      In-between they forced me to take her home otherwise we won't send her sister as well and file a case against you. So, I take her home 2-3 times for 10-10 days. We don't have anything physical. Even she knows that I don't like her and I know she doesn't like me but on the face, she told me I like u.      And In-between I like a girl and I told my family that I want to marry her but they won't agree. And they all told me to take your wife to Bangalore where i work. So, again I take her but this time I think I have spent living with her only but from 2-3 day I get to know that she is having chats with many boys on Facebook and WhatsApp.      Then I install a tracker on her phone and within 1 week I get to know that she is having sex chats with many boys on facebook and she knew them all and even meet them while taking tuitions. boys on FB normally told her love u and all. And video chats with every boys 4-5 times a day.

Believe me.  According to reliable sources, about 10,000 residential buildings in the city, after the Karnataka government introduced the Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) in 2005, do not have OCs. Among these, 50 per cent are apartments. Another alarming fact is that only 97 high-rise buildings have obtained OCs between 2009 and 2014. As per this statistic, hundreds of buildings in the city are being occupied without being issued an OC. However, what is startling is that most of this is done with the knowledge of the BBMP which collects property tax from such property owners inspite of them not possessing an OC. This amounts to a direct violation of Section 5.7 of the Bangalore Municipal Building Bye-law of 2003. Living in a flat without occupancy certificate? You may lose power BENGALURU: Rajini Chengappa, 58, and husband Vivek, 65, bought a flat in Kodigehalli, off Hebbal, in 2012. They moved into the sixth-floor flat a year later. The builder, Vivek says, had promised them an occupancy certificate (OC), but it has remained a promise. The Chengappas are not alone in their plight. Thousands of homeowners are facing a similar quandary. Nearly 10,000 buildings in Bengaluru, including 50% of apartments built after the Karnataka government introduced transfer of development rights (TDR) in the city in 2005, do not have OCs, say official sources. In many cases, though the building plans are approved, OCs are denied due to other violations. Obtaining an OC is a requirement under the Karnataka Apartment Ownership Act, 1972. The law says one cannot legally move into a building unless the developer gets an occupancy certificate from the BBMP or BDA. The corporation can ask apartment owners to leave such illegally occupied flats or impose heavy penalties. Replying to a question at the recent Belagavi assembly session, chief minister Siddaramaiah had said only 97 highrises in Bengaluru have obtained OCs between 2009 and 2014, while promising stern action against builders violating construction norms. Energy minister DK Shiva Kumar echoed similar views and directed officials to get tough with apartmnt builders, by disconnecting power. But it's not as easy as it seems, considering the quantum of violations, nexus between civic officials and builders and a lack of stringent laws. Many errant builders and developers have, over the years, gone scot-free, say those familiar with the working of the sector. There are several examples of builders disappearing without giving OCs and legal water connections to housing complexes. Apprehensive of losing their homes, buyers who've invested hard-earned money move into their flats and make do with water from pumps and water tankers. BOOM FUELLED GRAFT So why are such illegal buildings mushrooming in Bengaluru? Urban expert V Ravichander attributes it to a breakdown of the system and lack of transparency. \"There was a good system in place a decade ago. Following a real estate boom, unscrupulous builders began construction without approved plans, in an effort to increase profits. This not only broke down the system, but also fuelled corruption.\" The bigger problem, says RTI activist BM Shivakumar, is that in the absence of well laid-down regulations, a person can get into the real estate business and start construction of a project without approvals or environmental clearances. \"Why blame private builders? Many BDA flats owners have not got OCs after due to failure to obtain environmental clearance,'' he alleged. Some experts and activists, however, expect such malpractices will be curtailed after the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Bill 2013, is implemented. They believe it will rein in the strong builder lobby, even if it cannot control it completely. Ravichander favours a retrospective and comprehensive policy to regularize buildings without OCs. Architect G Ramesh says occupants must be allowed to approach the BBMP and BDA and apply for OCs after paying a certain compensation. The corporation must facilitate the process, he added. ISSUE NEEDS A RELOOK This needs proper and scientific analysis. Members of the Association get occupancy certificates, as required by the Act. There are many outside the purview of the Association and perhaps many who haven't got the required certificate. The classification of highrise itself needs a complete relook. There are multiple agencies involved in sanctioning OCs, and perhaps the figure quoted is of a particular authority. Buildings that have OCs are many more, since it isn't possible to get various agency clearances and connections without OCs. THE KARNATAKA MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS ACT, 1976. 310. Completion certificate and permission to occupy or use.- (1) Every person shall, within one month after the completion of the erection of a building or the execution of any such work, deliver or send or cause to be delivered or sent to the Commissioner at his office notice in writing of such completion, accompanied by a certificate in the form prescribed in the byelaws signed and subscribed in the manner prescribed and shall give to the Commissioner all necessary facilities for the inspection of such buildings or of such work and shall apply for permission to occupy the building. 1 [(1A) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), where permission is granted to any person for erection of a building having more 512 Municipal Corporations 1977: KAR. ACT 14] than one floor, such person shall, within one month after completion of execution of any of the floors of such building, deliver or send or cause to be delivered or sent to the Commissioner at his office, a notice in writing of such completion accompanied by a certificate in the form prescribed in the bye-laws, signed and subscribed in the manner prescribed and shall give to the Commissioner all necessary facilities for inspection of such floor of the building and may apply for permission to occupy such floor of the building.]1 1. Inserted by Act 32 of 1986 w.e.f. 17.6.1986. (2) No person shall occupy or permit to be occupied any such building, 1 [or part of the building]1 or use or permit to be used the building or part thereof affected by any work, until,- (a) permission has been received from the Commissioner in this behalf; or (b) the Commissioner has failed for 2 [thirty]2 days after receipt of the notice of completion to intimate his refusal of the said permission. 1. Inserted by Act 32 of 1986 w.e.f. 17.6.1986. 2. Substituted by Act 32 of 1986 w.e.f. 17.6.1986 A completion certification is an important and mandatory legal document attesting to the fact that a new building has been constructed and completed according to all the safety norms and regulations of the Buildings Act. A mandatory no-objection certificate issued by the local development and municipal authorities, the completion certificate of any building in Karnataka proves that the building has been approved by the Bangalore Development Authority, as per the stipulations in the Karnataka Town and Planning Act (1961) and the Bangalore Development Authority Act (1976). Contents of a Completion Certificate The certificate should contain all the required details, including the identification of the land, the location, if the building has met all the standards of safety and regulation, the distance from the road, distance from surrounding buildings, height and other criteria set by the Municipal authorities, along with the building plan. In short, the completion certificate guarantees that the building has not violated any rule in that locality. The Apartment Ownership Acts in various states in India make it compulsory for an owner or builder to possess a completion certificate, in order to avail of basic amenities like water and electricity. In case of a builder or a developer, it is mandatory that they give a copy of the completion certificate to a person purchasing the house. How is a completion certificate awarded? Once the project is completed, the local authority inspects the premise on the basis of the building plan and awards the completion certificate, provided it is satisfied. The builder then applies to the departments yet again along with a copy of the completion certificate to get water, electricity connection and other basic amenities for the project. Provisional and final completion certificates A provisional or temporary completion is usually awarded to a builder if they want to hand over an apartment to residents but still have pending work to complete, such as finishing construction of amenities like the club house or painting. The provisional certificate expires after six months and should be followed by the builder applying for the final completion certificate. Why is it important to have a final completion certificate? A final completion certificate is awarded after the construction of a house is complete or if a group housing or apartment society is formed. It is a mandatory legal testimony to the fact that the builder has not violated any building rules and standards such as the floor area ratio limit, structural design, distance from road, quality of construction, distance from surrounding buildings, height of the building, number of floors and other criteria, along with an attested and approved building plan. This certificate is needed for an apartment or building to receive basic facilities such as electricity and water. In fact, the water rate is converted from non-domestic to domestic only after receiving a completion certificate. A buyer should not get possession of a house or building without a completion certificate, which also sets into motion other compulsories such as the payment of property tax and housing loans. What if a completion certificate is not awarded? If the developer has not been awarded a certificate of completion, buyers can either approach the local municipal authorities to award the completion certificate or can form a resident\u2019s welfare association to speed up the process. In case new properties operate without completion certificates, residents are threatened to be evicted and the city engineering department will penalise the properties for not paying property tax. Many people are unaware that a completion certificate is crucial to procure, before finishing payment of a final instalment in terms of purchasing a property. Builders tend to persuade hapless people into buying a property without possessing the appropriate legal documents. Hence, it is important to press for the builder to acquire a completion certificate, before releasing the final payment to the same. A completion certificate is also required to ensure that safety norms such as codes in the case of fires, accidents and other criteria are met. ================================================================================== What is a khata? A Khata is essentially a revenue document, detailing the assessment of a property, recording details about the property such as size, location, built up area and so on for the purpose of payment of property tax. It is also a kind of identification of the person who is primarily liable for payment of property tax. It is one of the required documents in case you require a building licence, trade licence or loan from banks or any other financial institutions. What is the difference between an A Khata and B Khata? What any property buyer should know while buying property in Bangalore is that it should have A khata. An A khata means you are buying a property that is legal, and it will allow you to construct on it and obtain a trade or building license. Here are some further details on the difference between A Khata and B Khata. Then how did the term B Khata come into being? Well in 2007 when BBMP came into being 2 things were apparent: 1) There were many properties that fell under its jurisdiction that were illegal constructions 2) There was a need for an uniform taxation policy Regarding the former the BBMP found that these illegal constructions were enjoying civic amenities without paying taxes. While regarding the latter, there was a need to consolidate the tax collection process to make it simpler which was earlier collected by 3 different bodies. Now, the newly formed BBMP had the power to levy taxes on the aforementioned illegal constructions. The taxes collected from these properties were recorded in a register known in common parlance as B register and the khata issued therein was known as a B khata. Thus anyone having a B khatha essentially is a non BBMP approved construction. Hence it is not advisable to buy such properties. However, it is only fair to mention that any B khata property can be converted into an A khata property. ====================================================================================="

The legal option which is available is to go for the revision proceedings against the order under Section 397 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. However, in your case, even revision proceedings also seems to be impossible as there is an apparent delay of 9 years whereas revision against the maintenance order should have been filed within 90 days from the decree or order passed. Even if you are able to convince and satisfy the court about this inordinate delay, the court may or may not allow your revision application. It may be assumed that you\u2019ll be taking the ground that your wife has deserted you and left the matrimonial home without any sufficient reason only to extort maintenance from you, even when she has sufficient means to maintain herself. So, in that case, Masud Ahmed vs. State of Bihar [2019 SCC OnLine Pat 1880] and Aarif vs. Shajida [2019 SCC OnLine MP 1379] could be of help to you as in these case laws, the Courts have approved the revision application of the husbands because the wives could maintain themselves. But let me tell you, numerous judgments have also been passed by the court holding that even if the wife is capable of earning or is earning, cannot be denied the maintenance by the husband. So, there is no hard and fast rule which the courts have been following in allowing or rejecting the revision application, it all depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.

Respondent: M.C. Motors and Ors. Hon'ble Judges/Coram: S.K. Dubey, J. (President) and Saroj Rajwade, Member Counsels: For Appellant/Petitioner/Plaintiff: Sunita Jadhwani for Deepesh Joshi, Advocate For Respondents/Defendant: Rekha Tiwari for Ravindra Tiwari, Advocate Subject: Consumer Catch Words Mentioned IN ORDER S.K. Dubey, J. (President) 1. This is a complainant's appeal against the order dated 28.8.1995 passed in Case No. 90/93 by the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Satna (for short the 'District Forum'). It is not in dispute that the complainant purchased a Canter Truck bearing No. MP 19-3529 financed by the respondent No. 2 under hire purchase agreement. In terms of the said agreement the amount of Rs. 2,40,300/- so advanced was to be paid in 24 monthly instalments. The said truck met with an accident on 19.7.1990 which was sent by the respondent No. 2 Financier to the workshop of respondent No. 1. The respondent No. 3 Insurance Company assessed the damage of Rs. 99,228/- which was paid to the repairer. After its repair the possession of the truck was not delivered to the appellant-complainant, therefore, the complainant alleging deficiency in service filed the complainant against the repairer, financier and the insurer. The respondent No. 1 averred that actual charges of repairs were Rs. 1,43,674.28 paise and on payment of the balance amount of Rs. 44,446.28 paise by the financier who sent the truck for repairs the delivery was made to the respondent No. 2. The complainant after making the payment of first instalment of Rs. 12,015/- did not make any payment from 2nd instalment of Rs. 12,015/- to 12th instalment of the same amount and from 13th monthly instalment of Rs. 8,010/-. Therefore, in terms of the hire purchase agreement in default of payment of monthly instalments and in not making the payment of balance amount of repair charges, the agreement was terminated and possession of the truck was retained it is a dispute between the hire purchaser and the financier which cannot be adjudicated in the summary jurisdiction of the Consumer FORA. The respondent No. 3 averr that in terms of insurance policy and IMT 55 as the vehicle was subject to hypothetical agreement, the amount assessed by the Surveyor of the damage was paid to the repairer. There was no deficiency in service the District Forum after appreciation of evidence did not find any deficiency in service on the part of any of the opposite parties, hence dismissed the complaint. 2. After hearing learned Counsel for the parties and on going through the record we are of the opinion that the finding recorded by the District Forum cannot be faulted with. In fact, it is a dispute between the hire purchaser and the financier in view of their contractual relationship in terms of the hire purchase agreement. Therefore, unless it is established that there was any deficiency in service on the part of the financier in terms of the agreement. The dispute could not be decided under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. Remedy if any, available to the complainant is to file a civil suit for the declaration and for possession of the truck. The appellant if so advised may take appropriate proceedings in the Civil Court of competent jurisdiction. See the decision of the Gujarat State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in case of Pravinchandra Hargovindas Joshi v. DCM Toyota Ltd. & Ors., I (1997) CPJ 129. In the result, the appeal fails and is dismissed with no order as to costs. A copy of this order be conveyed to the parties and a copy be sent to the District Forum alongwith the record of the case.

Respondent: DCM Toyota Limited and Ors. Hon'ble Judges/Coram: R.C. Mankad, J. (President) and Jatin P. Vaidya, Member Counsels: For Appellant/Petitioner/Plaintiff: A.P. Kansara, Advocate For Respondents/Defendant: N.M. Kapadia, Advocate Subject: Consumer Catch Words Mentioned IN ORDER R.C. Mankad, J. (President) 1. The complainant has filed this complaint for recovery of Rs. 1,28,663/- and compensation from the opponents on the following allegations. The complainant had, according to him, purchased DCM Toyota bearing Registration No. GJ-5-T-3114 (vehicle for short) under hire purchase scheme from Opponent No. 1 on April 22, 1991. The vehicle was purchased through Opponent No. 1 is manufacturer of the vehicle. Opponent No. 4 is its agent at Surat. Opponent No. 2 is alleged to be financier of Opponent No. 1, Opponent No. 1 had taken the vehicle on lease from Opponent No. 2. Opponent No. 3 is the Insurance Company with whom the vehicle was insured under Policy No. 40127/91 dated April 22, 1991. 2. The case of the complainant is that he had paid margin money and loan instalments totalling to Rs. 1,05,806/-to Opponent No. 1. He had paid Rs. 12,857/- to Opponent No. 4 towards insurance transportation, registration of vehicle etc. Complainant had also spent about Rs. 10,000/- for making addition and alteration in the vehicle. 3. It would thus appear from the facts stated above that the complainant was holding the vehicle as sub-lessee under a Hire Purchase agreement entered into with Opponent No. 1. The vehicle met with an accident on September 1, 1991 and 4 persons including the complainant's son died in the accident. The possession of the damaged vehicle was taken over by Opponent No. 4 on behalf of the Opponent No. 1. It is the case of the complainant that Opponent No. 1 must have received the sum assured viz., Rs. 2,93,000/- from the Insurance Company. According to the complainant, he is entitled to receive Rs. 1,28,663 /- from the Opponents. Opponents, however, failed to pay this amount inspite of letters written to Opponent No. 1 by himself and Surat Consumer Association. On the above grounds, the complainant has filed this complaint for recovery of Rs. 1,28,663/-, compensation and costs. 4. The Opponents have filed written statements resisting the claim made by the complainant. Their main contention is that complainant is not a consumer within the meaning of the definition of \"consumer\" given under Section 2(1)(d) of Consumer Protection Act and in any case, there being no deficiency of service on their part, he is not entitled to claim any compensation from them. It is further contended that the complainant is merely a sub-lessee and he has no right to file the complaint. In support of this contention, reliance is placed on the decision of this Commission in Kachhia Patel Rajendra v. DCM Toyota Limited and Ors; (Complaint No. 348/91 decided on October 15, 1993). 5. At the time of hearing of this complaint, the learned Advocate for the complainant submitted that he was pressing this complaint only against Opponent No. 1 and that too only to the extent of the money which is paid to it by Opponent No. 3 Insurance Company. Since the complaint is not pressed against Opponents No. 2,3 and 4, it shall stand dismissed against them. So far as Opponent No. 1 is concerned it is submitted on behalf of the complainant that Opponent No. 3 has paid some amount to it and since the complainant is entitled to this amount. Opponent No. 1 should be directed to pay that amount to hi m. There is absolutely no evidence on record as to whether Opponent No. 3 has paid any amount of Opponent No. 1. In fact, it appears from letter dated October 14, 1993 which is addressed by Opponent No. 3 to Opponent No. 1 and which is at page 33 that Opponent No. 3 had repudiated the claim on the ground that unauthorised passengers were carried in the vehicle. It is stated to the effect that the vehicle was a commercial vehicle meant for carrying or transporting goods only and since passengers were carried there was violation of terms and conditions of the RTO permit and the insurance policy. There is no other evidence to prove that Opponent No. 3 had paid any money to Opponent No. 1. But apart from that we fail to understand as to how any claim can be made against Opponent No. 1 under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act. There is a contractual relation between the Complainant and Opponent No. 1. There is a Hire Purchase agreement under which Opponent No. 1 has subleased the vehicle to the Complainant. It is not stated as to what services Opponent No. 1 was required to render to the Complainant and what deficiency was therein rendering such services on the part of Opponent No. 1. The insurance policy which is issued by the Insurance Company also stands in the name of Opponent No. 1. Opponent No. 1 had taken vehicle on lease from Opponent No. 2 and therefore it could not be said that it had no insurable interest in the vehicle. Therefore, even if it has received any sum from the Insurance Company for the damage to the vehicle it could utilise this amount for discharge of its liability to Opponent No. 2. It is true that the complainant has paid certain amount to Opponents No. 1 and 4. But for that reason alone, it could not be said that whatever amount is received by Opponent No. 1 from Opponent No. 3 is payable to the complainant. The questions which are involved in this complaint are such which could not be decided under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act. Remedy, if any, available to the complainant is to file a civil suit. In our opinion, therefore, this complaint deserves to be dismissed. In the result, this complaint is dismissed. However, there will be no order as to costs. Pravinchandra Hargovindas Joshi vs. DCM Toyota Limited and Ors. (17.06.1996 - SCDRC Gujarat)"

Under the IT Act, state IT secretary is the adjudicating officer, to adjudicate matters in respect of contraventions, like online frauds and order compensation of up to Rs1 crore to the complainant   Maharashtra's principal secretary for Information Technology (IT) department, Rakesh Aggarwal, in a recent case, directed six banks, one mobile operator and a card company to pay Rs1.06 crore compensation to victims of online frauds who have been duped over past two years.   According to a report in The Times of India, the order for compensation was issued by the state government's equivalent of a Cyber Crime Court, which is presided over by the principal secretary in charge of information technology. \"The principle secretary, Rakesh Aggarwal, functions as adjudication officer under Section 45 of the IT Act 2000. The banks that have been ordered to pay compensation include Central Bank of India, Royal Bank of Scotland, Punjab National Bank, IndusInd Bank, Yes Bank, State Bank of India. Other institutions who have been directed to pay are Vodafone and SBI Cards,\" the report says.   Customers duped in online frauds often find that there is no easy remedy available. This is despite, the Banking Codes and Standards Board of India (BCSBI) making it clear that in electronic fraud, the onus of proving that the customer participated in the fraud or compromised the user ID and password will shift to the bank.    Even the Damodaran Committee on Customer Services in Bank, in 2011, had recommended the same changes. Dr KC Chakrabarty, the then deputy governor of Reserve Bank of India (RBI), too had emphatically said that banks cannot push the burden of proof on the customer and, if they could not find suitable insurance cover to mitigate their risk, they may want to reconsider offering Internet banking at all.   With the historic ruling of the Cyber Crime Court, it now becomes important for everyone who is duped in online fraud to know about the Court and its jurisdiction. Let me know if you require any help, please call me via consultation call I will guide you further."

I wish to seek guidance from professional to understand as to what to do in this case. Want to know is this section 138 (Negotiable Instrument Act) case file is valid or not as they failed to justify the liability and also they recalled the Bank Guarantee which led to change in principle amount on which Cheque bounced case is filled. . Is there any earlier citation from court for similar reference case. I wish to seek guidance based citation of any court as what should I further do in this case.",

If the agency is unable to prove this they will lose the case. Besides their recalling the bank guarantee after the case was filed and the amount getting scaled down make it not a fit case under 138 of NI Act. 2) Much depends on how the evidence is lead and cross examination and the documents before the court. Supreme Court of India Rangappa vs Sri Mohan on 7 May, 2010. This citation can be quoted to substantiate the non existence of legally enforceable debt especially as you are disputing your signature and the the agency has no other proof."

DO NOT FILE anticipatory bail (AB) unless FIR is registered - you will be suggested to file AB but it will be of no use - due to technical aspects hence file only after FIR is filed - INFACT as there is no automatic arrest in 498A and the cops follow the procedure - you need not to worry on the AB at all. Cops will call your BIL and persons named in complaint even before filing an FIR for generic enquiry and would refer for mediation if needed.  b. As the marriage has been done just a month and so back - you can not file Divorce - However give the audio recordings and also given the disability of your BIL you may look for option available in Annulment of marriage under section 12 of crpc.  c. It seems this family just got into this marriage to blackmail your BIL and his family and now wants to ectract money on false pretexts.

My elder brother suffered a paralysis stroke last year and he has got his own problems with his wife after the stroke. So he cannot support. Now i should be the one who has to take care. And last year i suggested that next school year onwards we will shift to my parents house and whether to support or not it's up to her wish i said. She fought with me for almost 8 months to stop that happening. But i didn't listened so her decision was to put kids in a school near to her parents house, i have to help her in ways she can find a job, so that she can work and stay with Thier parents and i lost my job in feb2017(software)so i said i can give 3000 per month in case if she doesn't fight with my parents she agreed and she is staying with Thier parents since 8 months. She along with my two kids used to come on weekends and go back as we are from same locality. Last Saturday she came and had a Tiff with my mother on small issue of removing my plate after having dinner. I said if your intention is to fight don't come i will give money as we agreed. But she kept arguing till 12 am and packed her clothes and said she will not come again. I said i will drop her at her home , she refused and said promise on kids if you come out. Then she went to lane and created scene saying i thrown her out at this time with kids and she said she will complain to police. I went to her parents and took them along with me and asked them to take her. Initially she didn't listened and later they took her along with them. I said am ready to come to police station as i did nothing wrong. They said she is not well we will talk once she recovers. Next day suddenly my wife came around 3pm and sat in sofa. I asked her don't you feel shame for creating such big scene last night and again coming back. She asked me if i want her to come back or not. I said you can come anytime provided your intention is not to fight. She started calling somebody and informing what i just said. So i called my in-law and asked whats happening he said we will talk you come to my house. I didn't suspect and went alone there around 5-7 people standing beside the main gate i thought may be nieghbours .

The SC states if both the aforesaid conditions are satisfied, by a legal fiction, the transfer shall be deemed to have been made by fraud or coercion or undue influence. Such a transfer then becomes voidable at the instance of the transferor and the Maintenance Tribunal gets jurisdiction to declare the transfer as void.

If the husband and his family have not committed any offense under aforementioned sections, they have not taken any dowry or illegally kept with themselves the stuff belonging to the wife, they have not beaten the wife or caused any mental or physical harassment to her then they have every right to take precautions which I am going to mention now. The precautions mentioned here are based on an actual case in which the parties finally compromised their disputes but because of these preventive measures undertaken by the husband, husband\u2019s family and he himself were saved from treading the fiery path of criminal justice system. There are several ways that such evidences and precautions help the innocent accused persons \u2013 1. Police may refuse to register FIR. 2. If not arrested yet, then accused persons get anticipatory bail more easily 3. If any of the accused persons have been arrested, it is easy to get regular bail. 4. This helps a lot during trial. 5. Once a person gets anticipatory bail or regular bail, it breaks back-bone of the criminal case of wife because the most a court can do is jail a person and this is averted by anticipatory and cut short by regular bail. 6. This also helps a both the parties agree to reach a compromise. These steps to protect themselves from false section 498A cases and domestic violence criminal complaints (THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE) \u2013 1. They made a plan to protect their family and themselves. 2. They disposed off all property in their name. Example \u2013 they transferred it in the name of a known person/ friend. Once they were out of litigation, they got it transferred in their name again. (Take help of expert in doing so. Because you do not want that while you are trying to protect your property from wife, a friend misappropriates it.) 3. They maintained minimum balance in bank accounts. If they were privately employed, they asked their employers to give them salary in cash \u2013 without receipts. And then they do not show income in income tax returns. 4. They made recordings \u2013 voice and video. One of our clients had camera installed in bedroom and he was able to prove adultery of wife. 5. They made separate residence proofs \u2013 far from their own parents and family. 6. They lived separately with their wives and away from their parents. 7. Exceptional circumstance \u2013 The ones who were planning to go abroad before marriage sold all their properties and went abroad without informing their wives and relatives. (Thats like saying \u201cNow do what you want \u2013 We are not coming back.\u201d) 8. File quashing of FIR/ quashing of criminal complaint/ quashing of order under section 319 of CrPC."

                "response-text": "Dear Sir, You have many plus points in your favour. You just file a criminal case against them immediately under section 415 and 420 of Indian Penal Code for having cheated you. The moment they file 498A case you just obtain stay order and also file divorce case by way of seeking annulment of marriage. The relevant sections and relevant law is herewith under given: Non consummation of marriage entitles you to get divorce. Supreme Court Says, \"Spouses owe rights and duties to each other and in their relationship they must act reasonably.\"  A petition for divorce under Section 13 (1)(1-a) and (iii) of the HMA on the ground of cruelty as well mental disorder.can be filed by you.  The Court observed, \u201cUndoubtedly, not allowing a spouse for a long time, to have sexual intercourse by his or her partner, without sufficient reason, itself amounts mental cruelty to such spouse. A Bench of Three Judges of this Court in Samar Ghosh Vs. Jaya Ghosh (2007) 4 SCC 511 has enumerated some of the illustrations of mental cruelty.\u201d... Section 415 in The Indian Penal Code 415. Cheating.\u2014Whoever, by deceiving any person, fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so deceived to deliver any proper\u00acty to any person, or to consent that any person shall retain any property, or intentionally induces the person so deceived to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived, and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body, mind, reputation or property, is said to \u201ccheat\u201d. Explanation.\u2014A dishonest concealment of facts is a deception within the meaning of this section. Illustrations (a) A, by falsely pretending to be in the Civil Service, inten\u00actionally deceives Z, and thus dishonestly induces Z to let him have on credit goods for which he does not mean to pay. A cheats. Section 420 in The Indian Penal Code 420. Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property.\u2014Whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly induces the person de\u00acceived to deliver any property to any person, or to make, alter or destroy the whole or any part of a valuable security, or anything which is signed or sealed, and which is capable of being converted into a valuable security, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine. Grounds For Annulment The grounds for a marriage annulment may vary according to the different legal jurisdictions, but are generally limited to fraud, bigamy, blood relationship and mental incompetence including the following: 1) Either spouse was already married to someone else at the time of the marriage in question; 2) Either spouse was too young to be married, or too young without required court or parental consent. (In some cases, such a marriage is still valid if it continues well beyond the younger spouse's reaching marriageable age); 3) Either spouse was under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the marriage; 4) Either spouse was mentally incompetent at the time of the marriage;  5) If the consent to the marriage was based on fraud or force;  6) Either spouse was physically incapable to be married (typically, chronically unable to have sexual intercourse) at the time of the marriage; 7) The marriage is prohibited by law due to the relationship between the parties. This is the \"prohibited degree of consanguinity\", or blood relationship between the parties. The most common legal relationship is 2nd cousins; the legality of such relationship between 1st cousins varies around the world. 8) Prisoners sentenced to a term of life imprisonment may not marry. 9) Concealment (e.g. one of the parties concealed a drug addiction, prior criminal record or having a sexually transmitted disease) Basis Of An Annulment In Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act 1955, there are some conditions laid down for a Hindu Marriage which must be fulfilled in case of any marriage between two Hindus which can be solemnized in accordance with the requirements of this Act.  Section 5 Condition for a Hindu Marriage - A marriage may be solemnized between any two Hindus, if the following conditions are fulfilled, namely: (i) Neither party has a spouse living at the time of the marriage; (ii) At the time of the marriage, neither party,- (a) is incapable of giving a valid consent of it in consequence of unsoundness of mind; or (b) though capable of giving a valid consent has been suffering from mental disorder of such a kind or to such an extent as to be unfit for marriage and the procreation of children; or (c) has been subject to recurrent attacks of insanity or epilepsy; (iii) The bridegroom has completed the age of twenty one years and the bride the age of eighteen years at the time of the marriage; (iv) The parties are not within the degrees of prohibited relationship unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two; (v) The parties are not sapindas of each other, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two: An annulment may be granted when a marriage is automatically void under the law for public policy reasons or voidable by one party when certain requisite elements of the marriage contract were not present at the time of the marriage"

They convinced me to pay them the amounts for registration, services charges, some extra amount also in name of job. I was so trapped in all that and finally after paying around 117000 to them and in return i didnt get any service job calls from them. I asked them to return my money but they said its not possible. They stopped receiving my calls after that. I could not trace them as all the numbers were not reachable and i didnt have any details about the company.    In 2016, January i received a call from some person telling me that they are the MNC under which that fraud company working as vendor company and they have clarified the accounts and returning my money which they have traced amounting to Rps 98300. But in return they asked me to pay the tax amount to get my money back. I was not convinced and didnt entertain them.    Again, now on 8th Sep'17 I got this same type of call and again they told me that they want to return the amount but in return i have to pay the GST of 15% i.e. 14745 in one transaction and within one hour I will get my 98300 back. They further mailed me about this same. I was convinced this time and paid them through Paytm in 3 transactions as my online banking was not working so had to do dis. And before transferring the amount i called the person i was in contact with. He told me that i can do it in 3 transactions also. hence i transferred the money in their bank account.    But, 10 mins later someone called me and said he is from account department and my transaction is not valid as it was to be done in one go not 3 different transactions. I argued as to how this would make a difference in tax. Moreover, i was not sure if I was suppose to pay this GST money or not.    He told me that is money would be refunded and my 98300 would only be returned if i pay this tax money in one transaction. I simply waited for my 14745 to be refunded. two days passed but i didnt received any money. I kept on calling but no one answered my call.    On 3rd day someone picked up the call, and i asked amount my refund so he told me this cant be done, and again i have to pay 15% GST on this 14745 then only they would be able to refund me this amount. I told them I will not pay any money now because this was clear fraud. I dont think their is any clause for refunding that customer have to pay GST to get the amount back which have been transferred wrongly.    I am unable to understand what to do to get this right as i dont want to pay any money to them in any case. I want to file an FIR but afraid if police will take some action or not.",

                "response-text": "Dear Sir, The following information may kindly be read: It is possible to change a Will at any time during the lifetime of the testator (the person making a Will), provided that the testator is of sound mind. However, it is not possible to change the witnesses of a Will after the registration process, since the witness is one who has witnessed the signature of the testator on the Will and has affixed his/her signature as a witness to the Will (as a witness to the signature of the testator). Under section 63 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925, a Will is required to be attested by two or more witnesses in the presence of the testator, each of whom have seen the testator sign or affix his mark to the Will or have received personal acknowledgement from the testator that he himself has signed the Will. Subsequently, at the time of obtaining probate, the attesting witnesses, or one of them is required to depose to this fact. This is because as per section 68 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, if a document is required by law to be attested, it shall not be used as evidence until one attesting witness at least has been called for the purpose of proving its execution, if there be an attesting witness alive, and subject to the process of the court and capable of giving evidence.    Therefore, on a conjoint reading of section 63 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925, and section 68 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, at least one of the attesting witnesses will need to depose for the purpose of proving due execution of a Will. In the event that no such attesting witness is alive or can be found, then as per section 69 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, the Will has to be proved by proving the signature of the testator as well as that of at least one attesting witnesses. Thus, while it is possible to obtain probate of a Will even if the attesting witnesses are dead, it may be a slightly more cumbersome procedure and a longer process."

They cannot insist on production of NOC (no objection certificate) anymore. 2) Disposing scores of petitions that were filed complaining about the non registration of land properties by authorities, Justice C V Nagarjuna Reddy of the AP High Court specified several dos and don'ts for the sub registrars in the state. According to these directives, the registering officers shall not insist on production of NOCs as a pre condition for registration of land. 3) Further, the judgment said the registering officers shall not refuse to receive the documents for registration only on the ground that the properties were included in the prohibitory list sent by the revenue authorities, for reasons such as that the ownership column of the title deed contains dots, or that the land is government waste land in the revenue records or that the land is assigned. 4) In cases of entries containing dots or describing the land as belonging to the government, unless a notification is issued under Section 22-A(2) of the Registration Act, officials shall not refuse to receive and register the documents, Justice Nagarjuna Reddy said. The registration of such documents, however, shall be without prejudice to the right of the government and its functionaries to initiate appropriate proceedings for recovery of possession of the properties covered by such documents, if in their opinion they belong to the government. 5) As far as assigned land is concerned, if there is a clear proof to the effect that such assignments were made prior to the issuance of GO 1142, dated 18-6-1954 in the Andhra area and GO 1406 dated 25-7-1958 in the Telangana area, the registering officials shall receive and register the documents, notwithstanding the fact that the properties were included in the prohibitory lists sent by the revenue authorities.

This served as the best excuse because the public information officer was spared the trouble of providing a reasoned explanation under the grounds enumerated in Section 8 of the RTI Act. The Central Information Commission, however, cracked the whip on public authorities using this as an excuse to turn down RTI pleas. In a judgement on September 2014, information commissioner Professor Sridhar Acharyulu recommended that criminal proceedings be initiated under the Public Records Act in cases where files are reported as missing. The Act criminalises the unauthorised destruction or movement of public records outside the country and provides for imprisonment of up to five years and a fine of up to Rs 10,000 for offenders. However, one rarely hears of convictions or even prosecutions under the Public Records Act. Conducting criminal investigations or prosecutions into missing files, however, is easier said than done. In criminal prosecutions, it must be proven beyond reasonable doubt that an accused has committed the stated offence. Proving that a particular bureaucrat is responsible for a missing file is difficult and in most cases, it is unlikely these issues will even be investigated."

This is the object of the Order 38 rule 5 of The Civil Procedure Code,1908 (herein after referred as CPC) INTRODUCTION:-\u2018An attachment before judgment is to enable the plaintiff to realize the amount of the decree, supposing a decree eventually made, from the defendant property\u2019. This is the object of the Order 38 rule 5 of The Civil Procedure Code,1908 (herein after referred as CPC). See. Ganu Singh Vs Jangi Lal, 26 C 531. The scope and object of Order 38 rule 5 of CPC and the rules followed thereon merely to protect a plaintiff against loss arising from the defendant making away with his property pending suit. An attachment before judgment is in the nature of an interlocutory order. In Gurunadha Rao v. Gamini Krishnayya, a Division Bench of the Hon\u2019ble High Court of Andhra Pradesh held that to be valid an attachment must be specific and clear in its purport. In Shivaraya and Others Vs. Sharnappa and Others [AIR 1968 Mysore 283], the Hon\u2019ble Single Judge followed Bankim Chandra and Others\u2019 case and Tavvala Veeraswamy\u2019s case which considered such interlocutory orders to have been passed in exercise of the Court\u2019s ancillary powers. His Lordship Dawson-Miller C. J. stated as follows :\u201dThe power given to the Court to attach a deft.\u2019s property before judgment, is never meant to be exercised lightly or without clear proof of the existence of the mischief aimed at in the rule. (Ref. AIR 1951 Cal 156). DIFFERENCE BETWEEN \u2018ATTACHMENT PRIOR TO DECREE\u2019 AND \u2018ATTACHMENT AFTER DECREE\u2019:There is some difference between \u2018attachment prior to decree\u2019 and \u2018attachment after decree\u2019. Of course, if an attachment is ordered before judgment, no need to re attach the same property after decree. I will later on discuss this point of re-attachment in this article. An \u2018attachment prior to decree\u2019 is not an attachment for the enforcement of the decree, but it is a step for preventing the debtor from delaying or obstructing such enforcement when the decree subsequently passed is sought to be executed. [See Parur Central Bank Ltd. vs A.C. Chacko (1989); S.P. Vasakumar Pillai vs The Motor Accidents Claims (2008)].An attachment after decree is an attachment made for the immediate purpose of arraying the decree into execution, and if presupposes an applaication on the part of the decree holder to have his decree executed. See Sri Rammanik Vs.Tin Cowri Rai, B.L.R 63,67,68 FB (1869). It is a sort of a guarantee against decree becoming infructuous for want of property available from which the plaintiff can satisfy the decree. ( Ref: Sardar Govindrao Mahadik & Anr vs Devi Sahai & Ors, 1982 AIR 989, 1982 SCR (2) 186 ). A PLAINTIFF SHOULD SHOW, PRIMA FACIE, THAT HIS CLAIM IS BONA FIDE AND VALID:A defendant is not debarred from dealing with his property merely because a suit is filed or about to be filed against him. Shifting of business from one premises to another premises or removal of machinery to another premises by itself is not a ground for granting attachment before judgement. A plaintiff should show, prima facie, that his claim is bona fide and valid and also satisfy the Court that the defendant is about to remove or dispose of the whole or part of his property, with the intention of obstructing or delaying the execution of any decree that may be passed against him, before power is exercised under Order 38 Rule 5 C.P.C. Courts should also keep in view the principles relating to grant of attachment before judgment (see Prem Raj Mundra v. Md.Maneck Gazi, AIR (1951) Cal 156, for a clear summary of the principles.) KEY FACTORS OF ORDER 38 RULE 5 CPC:i. Where defendant may be called upon to furnish security for production of propertyii. Scope of ruleiii. Application of Order 38, Rule 5 CPCiv. Property without jurisdictionv. Call for securityvi. Conditional attachmentvii. Effect of attachment Order 38, Rule 5 CPC:-(1) Where, at any stage of a suit, the Court is satisfied, by affidavit or otherwise, that the defendant, with intent to obstruct or delay the execution of any decree that may be passed against him,-\u2013 (a) is about to dispose of the whole or any part of his property, or\u2013 (b) is about to remove the whole or any part of his property from the local limits of the jurisdiction of the Court,\u2013 the Court may direct the defendant, within a time to be fixed by it, either to furnish security, in such sum as may be specified in the order, to produce and place at the disposal of the Court, when required, the said property or the value of the same, or such portion thereof as may be sufficient to satisfy the decree, or to appear and show cause why he should not furnish security.\u2013 (2) The plaintiff shall, unless the court otherwise directs, specify the property required to be attached and the estimated value thereof.\u2013 (3) The Court may also in the order direct the conditional attachment of the whole or any portion of the property so specified.\u2013 (4) If an order of attachment is made without complying with the provisions of sub-rule (1) of this rule such attachment shall be void.Where defendant may be called upon to furnish security for production of property Scope of rule:-The Scheme of Order 38 and the use of the words `to obstruct or delay the execution of any decree that may be passed against him\u2019 in Rule 5 make it clear that before exercising the power under the said Rule, the court should be satisfied that there is a reasonable chance of a decree being passed in the suit against the defendant. This would mean that the court should be satisfied the plaintiff has a prima facie case. If the averments in the plaint and the documents produced in support of it, do not satisfy the court about the existence of a prima facie case, the court will not go to the next stage of examining whether the interest of the plaintiff should be protected by exercising power under Order 38 Rule 5CPC. . (See the Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in the CASE NO.: Appeal (civil) 6171 of 2001, Raman Tech. & Process Engg. Co. & Anr. Vs.Solanki Traders, DATE OF JUDGMENT: 20/11/2007; 2008 (2) SCC 302). The Hon\u2019ble Apex Court held in the case of Raman Tech. & Process Engg. Co. & Anr the power under Order 38 Rule 5 CPC is drastic and extraordinary power. Such power should not be exercised mechanically or merely for the asking.Application of Order 38, Rule 5 CPC:-Where the property is the property in suit, an injunction should be obtained :- Where the property is the property in suit, an injunction should be obtained under O.XXXIX r.1, Clause (a), which may be enforced under r.2 of that Order by imprisonment or attachment, And where the property is not that in suit, an alternative is given under r.1 of the same Order, Clause (b), where the words \u2018Property\u2019 is not confined to property within the jurisdiction, or property which is in dispute in the suit. [ Raja Goculdas Vs. Jankibai, 5 Bom. L.R. 570, at p.574 (1903), where it is pointed out that Joy narain Geeree Vs. Shibpershad,6 W.R. Misc. 1 (1866) is not applicable as Sec. 93 of the Code of 1859 was expressly limited to the property in dispute.].No attachment on light grounds:- In 1866, in the case of Gamble Vs Bholgir [2 BHCR 146,161], it was observed that the jurisdiction to attach before judgment should be exercised with great discretion, and no court should grant such an attachment on light grounds or unless it is perfectly satisfied with trustworthy evidence that the defendant is about to dispose of his property or to remove it from the jurisdiction of the Court.Where the most perfect good faith is wanting, the application should be rejected:- In all applications for attachment before judgment, there must be uberrina fides on the part of plaintiff, and where the most perfect good faith is wanting the application should be rejected. Ref. Ahmed Ali Vs. Gladstone Wyllie, 7 W.R 508 (1867).Any stage of the suit :- The application can be made at any stage of the suit, but can be entertained only so long as the suit is pending. See Sri Rammanik Vs.Tin Cowri Rai, B.L.R 68 FB (1869).Intention to obstruct or delay the execution of any decree which might be passed:- The facts mentioned in clauses (a) and (b) must have been done with the intent mentioned in the first paragraph, namely, to obstruct or delay the execution of any decree which might be passed. Ref: Ram Narain Vs. Levy, 2 Hyde, 183 (1864).The words, \u2018 about to dispose of \u2019:- Clause (a) says, is \u2018 about to dispose of \u2019,etc., therefore the section does not apply where the defendant has actually parted with the properties. Ref: Soorjee Kumar Vs. Issur Chunder, Bourke, 243 (1865).It does not refer exclusively to movable properties:- The Section does not refer exclusively to movable properties but applies to immoveable properties also. Ref: Bishambar Vs. Sukhdesi, 16 A 186 (1894).Attachment of property covers its profits:- As has been held in Ram Coomar Vs. Gobindnath, 12 W.R. 391 (1869), attachment of property covers its profits. But if the owner is allowed to enjoy them the profits cease to be specifically liable.In Govindrao Mahadik v. Devi Sahai, , the Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court held at para 58 of its judgment as follows: \u201cAttachment before judgment is levied where the Court on an application of the plaintiff is satisfied that the defendant, with intent to obstruct or delay the execution of any decree that may be passed against him (a) is about to dispose of the whole or any part of his property, or (b) is about to remove the whole or any part of his property from the local limits of the jurisdiction of the Court. The sole object behind the order levying attachment before judgment is to give an assurance to the plaintiff that his decree if made would be satisfied. It is a sort of a guarantee against decree becoming infructuous for want of property available from which the plaintiff can satisfy the decree.\u201d\u2013 In the case of Mamidala Suresh Babu And Ors. vs Tirumalasetti Krishnamurthy and \u2026 2006 (3) ALD 605, 2006 (3) ALT 250, the Hon\u2019ble High Court of Andhra Pradesh, it was held that the sine qua non for an order of attachment before judgment or for an order demanding security before judgment is that the defendant is disposing of or about to dispose of his property with the dishonest intention of defeating or delaying the possible decree in the suit. The merits of the claims of the contending parties are merely ancillary factors for consideration by the Court in arriving at a conclusion with regard to the essential requirements of Order 38, Rule 5, C.P.C. [Also See. Nowroji Pudumjee v. Deccan Bank Ltd., A. I. R. (8) 1921 Bom. 69]. Property without the jurisdiction:- It was held under the last Code both that the section did not and did apply where the property sought to be attached was beyond the jurisdiction of the Court in which the suit was pending. A Court which cannot attach primarily in execution of its decree cannot attach in anticipation of it. It was therefore held, even under the Code of 1859, that a Court of Small Causes could not attach immoveable property under this section. It was held that the Court had jurisdiction where the property was a chose in action due from the Collector who, like the judgment-debtor, resided within the jurisdiction of the attaching court. See. Ravji Moreshwar Vs. Narayan Ballal, 3 Bom. L.R. 462 (1901). Effect of attachment:-If we go through the ruling of the Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court in the case of Sardar Govindrao Mahadik & Anr vs Devi Sahai & Ors, 1982 AIR 989, 1982 SCR (2) 186, we can find answer to this question.What is the effect of attachment before judgment ? Attachment before judgment is levied where the court on an application of the plaintiff is satisfied that the defendant, with intent to obstruct or delay the execution of any decree that may be passed against him (a) is about to dispose of the whole or any part of his property. Or (b) is about to remove the whole or any part of his property from the local limits of the jurisdiction of the Court. The sole object behind the order levying attachment before judgment is to give an assurance to the plaintiff that his decree if made would be satisfied. It is a sort of a guarantee against decree becoming infructuous for want of property available from which the plaintiff can satisfy the decree. The provision in section 64 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that where an attachment has been made, any private transfer or delivery of the property attached or of any interest therein and any payment to the judgment debtor of any debt, dividend or other monies contrary to. such attachment, shall be void as against all claims enforceable under the attachment. What is claimed enforceable is the claim for which the decree is made. Motilal\u2019s suit was for a money claim. It finally ended in a decree for Rs. 500 by High Court and in between the 1st appellate court had dismissed Motilal\u2019s suit in entirety. There is nothing to show that the attachment which would come to an end on the suit being dismissed would get revived if a second appeal is filed which ultimately succeeds. In fact, a dismissal of the suit may terminate the attachment and the same would not be revived even if the suit is restored and this becomes manifestly clear from the newly added provision in sub rule (2) of rule 11 A of order XXXIII, C.P.C. which provides that attachment before judgment in a suit which is dismissed for default shall not be revived merely because by reason of the fact that the order for the dismissal of the suit for default has been set aside and the suit has been restored. As a corollary it would appear that if attachment before judgment is obtained in a suit which ends in a decree but if in appeal the decree is set aside the attachment of necessity must fail. There should be no difficulty in reaching this conclusion. (See 1982 AIR 989; 1982 SCR (2) 186; 1982 SCC (1) 237; and 1982 SCALE (1)191; and S. Noordeen vs S. Thiru Venkita Reddiar & Ors: 1996 AIR 1293, 1996 SCC (3) 289 for more knowledge as this aspect.) \u2013 To know the effect of Order XXXVIII Rules 5, and 7 of the Code of Civil Procedure; and section 136 of the Code of Civil Procedure, it is better to go through the following rulings: Rajender Singh vs Ramdhar Singh And Ors (2001) (CASE NO.: Appeal (civil) 4394 of 1991), Bansropan Singh and Others v. Emperor, AIR (1937) Patna 603, AIR (1963) Allahabad 320,Haji Pahim Bux and Sons and Others Vs Firm Samiullah, MG. Brothers v. Shah Talchand Parswachand & Co., AIR (1963) Mys. 147, Vannarakkal Kallalathil Sreedharan v. Chandramaath Balakrishnan and another, [1990] 3 SCC 291 and the Hon\u2019ble Apex Court approved the views expressed in Paparaju Veeraraghavayya v. Killaru Kamala Devi. AIR (1935) Mad; 193; Veerappa Thevar v.. C.S Venkatarama Aiyar, AIR (1935) Mad. 872 and Angu Pillai v. M.S.M, Kasiviswanthan Chettiar, AIR (1974) Mad. 16 followed by Rango Ramachandra Kulkarni v. Gurlingappa Chinnappa Muthal, AIR (1941) 198; Yesvant Shatikar Dunakhe V. Pyaraji Nurji Tambol, AIR (1943) Bom 145 and Kochuponchi Varughese v. Ouseph Lonan, AIR (1952) TC 467 Call for security:-           For form of order calling for security, see Sched.I., App., F., No.5. As to whether property beyond the jurisdiction can be attached under this rule. Cause can be shown after security has been furnished to avoid attachment. Section 145 CPC applies to surieties under this rule. An appeal lies under the present section. (see O.XLIII, R.1 (q)). The words \u2018produce and place at the disposal of the Court\u2019 in Order 38, Rule 5 refer only to such property as is capable of being produced in Court.Conditional attachment:-It might mean an attachment to be made conditionally on the security not being furnished or cause shown by the prescribed day, or it might mean an immediate attachment of a provisional kind conditioned to become plenary if security should not furnished or cause shown according to the terms of the order. (See. Lotlikar Vs. Lotlikar at p.644) Conclusion:-Let me conclude this article referring to the conditions to grant attachment before judgment. In the case of Premraj Mundra vs Md. Maneck Gazi And Ors.: AIR 1951 Cal 156, the following principles are given in para 10 as to attachment before judgment.\u2013 From a perusal of all the authorities, I think that the following guiding principles can be deduced :\u2013 (1) That an order under Order 38, Rules 5 & 6, can only be issued, if circumstances exist as are stated therein.\u2013 (2) Whether such circumstances exist is a question of fact that must be proved to the satisfaction of the Court.\u2013 (3) That the Court would not be justified in issuing an order for attachment before judgment, or for security, merely because it thinks that no harm would be done thereby or that the defts. would not be prejudiced.\u2013 (4) That the affidavits in support of the contentions of the applicant, must not be vague, & must be properly verified. Where it is affirmed true to knowledge or information or belief, it must be stated as to which portion is true to knowledge, the source of information should be disclosed, & the grounds for belief should be stated. (5) That a mere allegation that the deft. was selling off & his properties is not sufficient. Particulars must be stated.\u2013 (6) There is no rule that transactions before suit cannot be taken into consideration, but the object of attachment before judgment must be to prevent future transfer or alienation.\u2013 (7) Where only a small portion of the property belonging to the deft. is being disposed of, no inference can be drawn in the absence of other circumstances that the alienation is necessarily to defraud or delay the pltf\u2019s claim.\u2013 (8) That the mere fact of transfer is not enough, since nobody can be prevented from dealing with his properties simply because a suit has been filed: There must be additional circumstances to show that the transfer is with an intention to delay or defeat the pltf.\u2019s claim. It is open to the Court to look to the conduct of the parties immediately before suit, & to examine the surrounding circumstances, & to draw an inference as to whether the deft. is about to dispose of the property, & if so, with what intention. The Court is entitled to consider the nature of the claim & the defence put forward.\u2013 (9) The fact that the deft. is in insolvent circumstances or in acute financial embarrassment, is a relevant circumstance, but not by itself sufficient.\u2013 (10) That in the case of running businesses, the strictest caution is necessary & the mere fact that a business has been closed, or that its turnover has diminished, is not enough.\u2013 (11) Where however the deft. starts disposing of his properties one by one, immediately upon getting a notice of the pltf.\u2019s claim, &/or where he had transferred the major portion of his properties shortly prior to the institution of the suit & was in an embarrassed financial condition, these were grounds from which an inference could be legitimately drawn that the object of the deft. was to delay and defeat the pltfs\u2019. claim.\u2013 (12) Mere removal of properties outside jurisdiction, is not enough, but where the deft. with notice of the pltfs\u2019. claim, suddenly begins removal of his properties outside the jurisdiction of the appropriate Court, & without any other satisfactory reason, an adverse inference may be drawn against the deft. Where the removal is to a foreign country, the inference is greatly strengthened.\u2013 (13) The deft. in a suit is under no liabilty to take any special care in administering his affairs, simply because there is a claim pending against him. Mere negect, or suffering execution by other creditors, is not a sufficient reason for an order under Order 38 of the Code.\u2013 (14) The sale of properties at a gross undervalue, or benami transfers, are always good indications of an intention to defeat the pltf\u2019s. claim. The Court must however be very cautious about the evidence on these points & not rely on vague allegations.\u2013 In the judgment reported in 2005 (2) MLJ 417, the Hon\u2019ble Madras High court has held as follows:\u2013 \u201c16. O.38, Rule 5, C.P.C. is a drastic order, which interferes with the right of the parties to deal with his property/money. Before passing an order of attachment before judgment, the Court must be satisfied on the compliance ofO.38, Rule 5, C.P.C. by readingO.38, Rule 5, C.P.C., it is clear that the essential requirements must be proved to the satisfaction of the Court as pointed out in the decision reported in Renox Commercials Limited. v. Inventa Technologies Private Limited Renox Commercials Limited. v. Inventa Technologies Private Limited Renox Commercials Limited. v. Inventa Technologies Private Limited A.I.R. 2000 Mad.213:,\u2013 (i) the defendant is about to dispose of his property or is about to remove the property from the jurisdiction of the Court, and\u2013 (ii) the defendant is intending to do so with a view to causing obstruction to, or delaying the execution of any decree that may be passed against the defendant; and\u2013 (iii) The plaintiff should state precisely the grounds on which the belief or apprehension can be entertained, that the defendant is likely to dispose of, or remove the property.\u2013 Thus, the plaintiff precisely state the grounds on which plaintiff bank has entertained the plea or apprehension that the defendant is likely to dispose or remove the property.\u201d (This was observed by the the Hon\u2019ble Madras High court in 2014 in the case of R.Ramesh vs R.Raveender.)"

There is numerous complaint against the promoters. We are not talking about every promoter or every real estate agent by everyone knows that there are some people who are not being honest. Due to their unending greed for money, the innocent buyers have to suffer. There are many cases registered where we can find that a buyer looking for a home for his family has to spend his time complaining against the builders. These complaints come in regards to late possessions of apartments by the promoters, unreasonable charges, change of plans etc. Due to the endless complaints, the Real Estate Regulatory Authority Agency has taken the matters into its own hand and has formulated an agency known as RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Authority). RERA has brought some milestone changes regarding the laws in real estate sector of India. The wholehearted commitment of the government into maintaining fair play in the property business has come as a big relief for the buyers. Apart from the buyers, the promoters and the real estate agents who go by the government norms, but have to suffer from the spread of bad word against them due to some ill practices by some promoters and real agents, also will feel happy and relieved. meraRERA is a portal made to make a healthy relationship for the promoters, agents and the buyers. It is very necessary that these three bodies work in tandem and help each other as the real sector of any country is its right arm regarding its economy. Apart from informing the promoters about the new guidelines, they have to follow and their functions in order to maintain a just way of purchasing and selling a house. meraRERA is also trying to make the real estate agents more efficient and customer-friendly so that the communication gap between a buyer and a promoter cannot lead to major issues and problems. All this will be done so that a buyer never feels cheated again. RERA has set up some fundamental functions for the buyers which are laid upon as their rights. A buyer is entitled to know all the plans of a real estate project in detail. He has the right to know the stage-wise completion of the project which includes the amenities as well. A buyer is entitled to claim a written possession of his house and the common areas which he is entitled to as a member of the project. He has the right to get all the documents regarding the project. A buyer has to pay the amount he has signed the agreement in the court. He will have to pay interests if he delays the payment. However, a promoter has to pay the same interest to the buyer if he delays his project or if he has not been able to provide what was said in the agreement. The buyer should participate in forming an association after taking the physical possession of his house. He should also be active on the website of RERA India so that the flow of information can be maintained. His participation towards the deed of the apartment can be beneficial for other buyers. ================================================================================="

There are three conditions that have to be prove by you and your mother before purchasing such agricultural lands. 3. However the limit is enhanced to Rs.25 lakhs with retrospective effect, the relevant notification/amendment is as follows: The Legislative Assembly on Friday passed the Karnataka Land Reforms (Amendment) Bill, 2015, to increase the income limit for non-agricultural sources to purchase farmland from Rs. 2 lakh to Rs. 25 lakh. The Bill empowers deputy commissioners of districts, instead of assistant commissioners, to grant permission for non-agriculturists to purchase agricultural land under Section 80 of the Act. In reply to the debate on the Bill, Revenue Minister V. Srinivas Prasad said taking into account inflation, which was nearly 300 per cent in the last two decades, the maximum income limit was fixed at Rs. 25 lakh. Despite opposition from some quarters, it was decided to fix the limit to prevent misuse of farmland, he said. Mr. Prasad said the last income limit revision was in 1995 when the former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda was the Chief Minister. Mr. Gowda increased the income limit from Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 2 lakh. In 1991, the income limit was increased from Rs. 12,000 to Rs. 50,000, Mr. Prasad said."

MUMBAI: \"Must a name mean something?\" asks Alice as she travels through Wonderland while William Shakespeare famously asked \"What's in a name?\" To a Mumbai resident it definitely meant something as he fought a legal battle all the way to the Supreme Court to stop his ex-wife from using his surname. Fifty-three-year-old Dinesh Patil, an assistant police inspector with the Mumbai police, finally won the battle with the apex court recently dismissing an application by his former wife Nisha (34) to continue using her ex-husband's name after their divorce. \"We are not inclined to interfere with the impugned order (passed by the Bombay High Court and family court),\" said the apex court.      \"There is no law governing the issue,\" said advocate R T Lalwani who represented Patil in the high court and family court. \"The SC order can be cited as a precedent for any man who objects to his former wife whom he has divorced from continuing to use his surname.\"      \"A woman acquires her matrimonial surname by virtue of her marriage. When the marriage is dissolved, the man definitely has the right to take recourse to the law to restrain his former wife from using his name,\" added Lalwani.      Earlier this year, additional solicitor-general Darius Khambata had given a                                                                       legal opinion in another case that a divorced woman could use her former husband's name. \"The wife has a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution of India (right to life) to use any name including her married name notwithstanding the fact that her marriage has been dissolved,\" Khambata had submitted in a case where the passport office had refused to renew the passport of a divorced Pune woman in her former married surname. However, in that case the man did not have any objection to his former wife using his surname.      In the present case, Patil had married Nisha in 1995. It was his second marriage after his first wife died. According to Nisha, within eight months of the marriage, Patil threw her out of the house. Patil filed for divorce in 1997 and a family court dissolved the marriage in 2006. When Nisha sough more maintenance, Patil moved an application seeking to bar her from continuing to use his surname. He claimed that she was misusing his name.      The family court in 2009 passed an injunction to stop her using her former husband's name. \"By using the name/surname (of the husband), there is always a possibility of people being misled that she still is his wife, when in fact she is not,\" observed the family court judge. A year later, the high court in February 2010 agreed and said that Nisha \"cannot use the husband's name anywhere, including in her bank account.\"      Nisha then filed a special leave petition before the Supreme Court seeking to challenge the HC order. Her petition contended that the family court did not have jurisdiction to give an order in the matter of surname. \"There is no rule governing (the issue of) using the surname of the ex-husband after divorce,\" Nisha argued, adding, \"Surname is not a trademark which can be patented by an individual.\" The apex court dismissed Nisha's petition.",

                "response-text": "judgment of bombay HC is available online . unable to find SC judgment  Bombay High Court Neelam Dadasaheb Shewale vs Dadasaheb Bandu Shewale on 17 February, 2010 Bench: R. S. Dalvi 1. This writ petition challenges three interim orders passed in MJ Petition No.A1633/97 which was for enhancement of maintenance under 25 (2) of the Hindu Marriage Act. 2. It may be mentioned that an application under that provision can be filed only upon change in the circumstances of either party which would require modification of the order of permanent alimony passed. 2 3. Two orders are passed upon three applications of the parties. 4. One application was filed by the ex-husband (husband) seeking to restrain his ex-wife (wife) from using his surname (name) since divorce decree has been already passed and has became final. This application came to be filed as an interim application in the fresh petition filed by the wife after divorce. 5. The Advocate on behalf of the wife argued that the separate petition only should have been filed. Both these reliefs, permanent and interim, are between the same parties pursuant to the same marital relationship which has since ceased. Under Section 7 of the Family Courts Act the Family Court has jurisdiction to decide the petition-application as well as a suit or proceeding (permanent or interim), for injunction arising out of the marital relationship. The husband can, therefore, file a separate application/petition for injunction or take out an application in the wife's application/petition already filed. In fact, the husband can 3 file a counterclaim in any petition with regard to any relief arising out of the marital obligation. An application which may be in the nature of counterclaim, can therefore be allowed an interim application. 6. The substance of the application is required to be considered rather than its form. The substance of the application of the husband is that the wife should not use his name. 7. The Advocate on behalf of the wife fairly concedes that since the marriage has been dissolved by a decree for divorce which has become final, the wife cannot use the name of the husband. That is the only substance to be considered by the Family Court. Under the impugned order dated 23rd September, 2009 the Family Court has considered that aspect as an application arising out of a marital relationship. It is correctly considered. The order needs no interference. 8. In fact, the Advocate on behalf of wife mentioned that the bank account of the wife stands in both her names. That 4 statement itself shows that the wife uses the name of the husband even after their marital relationship has been dissolved by an order of the Court. The description of the bank account is therefore improper. It is, therefore, clarified that the wife cannot use the husband's name anywhere including in her bank account. The injunction granted by the Family Court in the application of the husband shall be effectuated for all purposes. 9. The writ petition also challenges another order of the same date between the same parties but in two different applications. One was the application filed by the wife for her to be represented by her constituted attorney on the ground that she is ill, does not know English, she has been mentally tortured at the hands of the husband and she would not be able to stand the court proceeding. The other application is filed by her constituted attorney asking for permission to represent the wife as she cannot financially afford a lawyer, lawyers are otherwise not permitted and that she would be entitled to assistance of the person she has faith in. 5 10.The legal right of a party in Family Court to be represented by her constituted attorney in place of her Advocate who is registered legal practitioner is required to be seen. Under Section 13 of the Family Courts Act no party is entitled as of right to be represented by a legal practitioner. However, the Court may appoint legal expert as amicus curie to assist her/him. A party has full right to appear before the Family Court. None can object to such appearance. The wife does not desire to have an Advocate. She has refused legal aid offered to her. She contends that she has faith only her constituted attorney. The extent of the right of a constituted attorney is laid down in Order III Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Code as follows : ORDER III : 1. Appearances, etc., maybe in person, by recognized agent or by pleader. - Any appearance, application or act in or to any Court, required or authorized by law to be made or done by a party in such Court, may, except where otherwise expressly provided by any law for the time being in force, be made or done by the party in person, or by his recognized agent, or by a pleader [appearing, applying or acting, as the case may be,] on his behalf : 6 Provided that any such appearance shall, if the Court so directs, be made by the party in person. (emphasis supplied) 11.What is appearance, application or act has been considered by Chief Justice Chagla, as he then was, in the case of Aswin Shambhuprasad Patel and others Vs. National Rayon Corporation Ltd. (AIR 1955 BOMBAY 262). The provision of the aforesaid order was considered taking into account the Bar Councils Act and the Bombay Pleaders Act. It has been held that the aforesaid rule would not apply where a law for the time being in force otherwise expressly provided. It is held that pleading is not included in the expression \"appearance, application or act in or to any Court\". This is so because, the right of audience in Court, the right to address the Court, the right to examine and cross-examine the witnesses are dealt with in other parts of the Civil Procedure Code and not under Order 3. It was further held the right of audience in Court is a part of pleading in Court and not \"acting\" as provided under Order 3. It is further observed that a party in person would have a right of audience in Court and not his recognized agent who would be \"appearing, applying or acting\" on his behalf. 7 12.Further the right of pleaders to plead in a Court of law under authority of the client and to have a right of audience in Court as a member of Bar is not dealt with under Order 3. The members of the Bar have a right in clause 10 of the Letters Patent as they are qualified to plead in Court as required by specific legislation and rules. Under that clause no person except Advocates, Vakils or Attorneys would be allowed to act or plead for and on behalf of any suitor except the suitor himself. Considering Section 8 of the Bar Councils Act under which no person was entitled to practice as an Advocate unless his name was entered in the roll of Advocates, it was observed that the expression \"practice\" is wider than the expression \"plead\". Similarly Section 9 of the Bombay Pleaders Act, which was similar to the above section, was considered. The proviso to that section allowed a party to appear, plead or act on his own behalf but a recognized agent of the party was allowed to only appear or act (and not plead). It was therefore observed that proviso made a distinction between appearing, pleading or acting and appearing or acting. Whereas the party could do all three of the above her/his constituted attorney 8 could do only the above two. Consequently it was held that in the District Courts a recognized agent had no right to plead by relying on provision 9 of the Bombay Pleaders Act. It was observed that the right of audience is a natural and necessary concomitant of the right to plead and as the recognized agent had no right to plead, it follows that he has no right of audience in Court. 13.The law that is laid down in the aforesaid judgment holds true and good till now and even within Section 13 of the Family Courts Act. The object of Section 13 of the Family Courts Act is to allow a party to represent her/his case and consequently right of the lawyer to plead, appear and have audience in Court is limited but the right given to the party to appear is not extended to that parties' constituted attorney. Hence, the general law of procedure under Order 3 Rule 1 as also the special laws contained in the Bar Councils Act and the Bombay Pleaders Act would apply even in a Family Court. The object of that provision is that only qualified persons are entitled to appear in Courts and represent the case of their parties. The qualification is of the knowledge of the law and 9 the enrollment under the Act. If constituted attorneys of all the parties are allowed to appear, the Court would be overrun by any number of unqualified, unenrolled persons. Since Civil Procedure Code would generally apply to a Family Court under Section 10 of the Act, the restraint upon appearance under Order 3 of the Code must hold good. 14.In the case of Pavithra Vs. Rahul Raj (AIR 2003 MADRAS 138 it has been held that the recognized agent of the party in a Family Court proceedings cannot be allowed to prosecute it. Considering the various provisions of the Family Courts Act which follow the procedure different from the Civil Courts, it is observed that the parties themselves can be heard. Some times legal assistance can be provided. However, personal appearance of the parties is inevitable to comply with the mandatory provisions of the Family Courts Act. Though the authorized agent, who is not a legal practitioner can file a petition, he can only prosecute or defend it or represent the party only until the Family Court passes an order directing the party to appear in person depending upon the facts and stage of the case. In that case the constituted attorney sought 10 permission to defend the case on the ground that she was not able to come to India to contest the case. Such a permission, it was held, could not be granted. 15.In the case of Sudha Kaushik Vs. Umesh prasad Kaushik (AIR 2005 GUJARAT 244) upon considering the law under normal circumstances as aforesaid it was held since that case the petitioner's life was in danger his father was allowed to represent his son in the interest of justice though it was held that in normal circumstances any citizen or party is not allowed to be represented by his power of attorney unless he is an Advocate of the Court. 16.Consequently both the orders of the Family Court, Bandra, Mumbai dated 23.09.2009 are correct and cannot be interfered with. Writ petition is dismissed. (R. S. DALVI, J.) Print Page"

        "query-text": "Hello,    My mother had allowed her sister-in-law to take care of her property in Ludhiana, Punjab as caretaker/licensee because my mother was working in Sikkim so couldn't physically be present to take care of the property. All the legal papers of the property are in my mother's name like registry/sale deed etc. They have been staying in our property since 25 years.    My mom retired in Dec, 2016 and asked her to vacate the house now as she herself wants to come back from Sikkim and live in her homeland. The caretakers refused to vacate and file a suit against us stating that they own the house as they have been living there since almost 25 years and paying electricity bills etc. They have no legal papers as such of the property as all papers are in my mother's name. My mom is retired old age person with heart ailments and is unnecessarily getting harassed.    My question is that can a caretaker/licencee claim to be owner of a property just because they have been living in that particular property for so many years. Early many lawyers said that caretaker has no rights on property be it for howsoever long period of time they may be living there but today somebody told me about ADVERSE POSSESSION as stipulated in section 65 of Limitation Act, 1963, and said it gives caretaker the possession if they have been living continuously for more than 12 years.    Thus what does apply in our case. Can the caretakers be given ownership on the basis of Adverse Possession or we will get back our property according to law.",

Even by long possession of years or decades such person would not acquire any right or interest in the said property. it further held that Caretaker, watchman or servant can never acquire interest in the property irrespective of his long possession. The caretaker or servant has to give (up) possession (of the property) forthwith on demand. Apex Court also laid fresh guidelines that caretakers, watchman or servants do not acquire any title to a property merely because of its possession by them for several years. Court further observed that Litigation pertaining to valuable real estate properties is dragged on by unscrupulous litigants in the hope that the other party will tire out and ultimately would settle with them by paying a huge amount. which happens because of the enormous delay in adjudication of cases in our courts. If pragmatic approach is adopted, then this problem can be minimised to a large extent. The apex court passed the ruling while upholding an appeal of Maria Margarida Sequeria Fernandes who was embroiled in a two-decade-long legal battle with her brother and former Member of Parliament Erasmo Jack de Sequeria, whom she had appointed as a caretaker of her property in Goa. Full text of the Judgement is as Follows SUPREME COURT OF INDIA MARIA MARGARIDA SEQUERIA FERNANDES AND OTHERS VERSUS ERASMO JACK DE SEQUERIA(DEAD) THROUGH L.RS. Civil Appeal No. 2968 of 2012 (Arising out of SLP (C) No. 15382 of 2009)-Decided on [deleted]. Possession by Caretaker, Servant, Watchmen or Gratuitous stay JUDGEMENT Dalveer Bhandari, J.-Leave granted. 2. This appeal emanates from the judgment and order dated 5.5.2009 passed by the High Court of Bombay, Bench at Goa in Civil Revision Application No.3 of 2009. 3. Appellant No.1 and respondent No.1, Erasmo Jack de Sequeira (now dead) were sister and brother, hereinafter referred to as appellant and respondent respectively.   4. According to the appellant, she is the sole owner and is in exclusive possession of the suit property. Her title of the said suit property was clearly admitted, and never disputed by the respondent, Erasmo Jack de Sequeira. According to the appellant, the suit property was given to her brother as a caretaker. The respondent has kept appellant, his own sister, out of her suit property for about two decades by suppressing relevant material and pertinent information from the Court and abusing the process of law. 5. Both the appellant and the respondent hail from the State of Goa and belong to one of the leading and well known families of Goa. The father of the appellant and the respondent, Dr. Jack D. Sequeira was an affluent businessman and a well-known politician of Goa. Dr. Sequeira, during his lifetime, gave a number of properties worth crores of rupees to the respondent and also gave some properties to the appellant and her sisters. The respondent was given a soft drink factory at Goa, mining leases of iron ore, agricultural lands and residential plots including one situated at Dona Paula, which is located next to the Governor\u2019s House. Though the respondent was given properties worth several crores of rupees, he still eyed on a small property which the appellant purchased through Court auction after paying full sale consideration. The respondent- brother of the appellant was also a very influential and important Member of Parliament. He was also very active in the local politics in Goa.   6. The appellant urged that the suit property originally belonged to her grandmother. Under the Portuguese Law, her (grandmother\u2019s) children, i.e. two sons and a daughter (the appellant\u2019s father, uncle and aunt) got 1/3rd share each in the said suit property. The suit property of her grandmother was put to auction and this suit property in question was purchased in auction by the appellant. In the Inventory Proceedings No. 1075/935 in the year 1968, she became the exclusive owner of the suit property. Admittedly, the appellant has placed a certified copy of the order of the Civil Judge, Senior Division at Panaji dated 27th May, 1972 issued in favour of the appellant. According to the appellant, the possession and title of the suit property in favour of the appellant is established from the judgment of the Inquiry Officer of City Survey Tiswadi, Panjim, Goa. The said order was not only passed in the presence of the respondent, but also in the presence of his Attorney, Rodrigues who was also a senior executive officer of the respondent. The relevant portion of that judgment is as under:- \u201cThe claim put forth by Shrimati Maria Teresa de Sequeria from Panaji, in respect of Chalta No.14 of P.T. Sheet 65 was inquired into and it was found that the same belongs to the said Maria Teresa de Sequeria in view of Inventory Proceedings No.9- 1968 [1075- 935] \u2013 vide Certificate issued by the Court of Civil Judge Senior Division, Panaji dated 27.5.72 and as such her title and possession to the Chalta No.14 of P.T. Sheet No.65 is confirmed.\u201d 7. According to the appellant, she obtained the exclusive title of the plot and the house in question. 8. It may be pertinent to mention that the respondent had even participated in the said Court proceedings on behalf of his handicapped aunt, Edna May Sequeria as a guardian and received a cheque on her behalf. The appellant had deposited Rs.40,000/-, the owelty money in the said Court proceedings which became payable on account of the purchase of the said house. The said suit property stood registered in Panaji Municipal Council in the name of the appellant. House tax was paid by the appellant to the Municipality on self- occupation basis. Further, it is submitted that the possession of the suit property always remained with the appellant.   9. The Panaji Municipal Council, Goa issued a certificate showing that possession of the suit premises was with the appellant and the house tax of the suit property was paid by her and she was the recorded owner of the same. According to the appellant, the respondent himself had acknowledged possession and title of the suit property in favour of the appellant. 10. The appellant submitted that she got married on 8.9.1974 to an Officer of the Indian Navy who was posted from time to time in different places in India. She also submitted that the respondent \u2013 her brother requested her that as his office is just adjacent to the suit property, therefore, it would be convenient for him to run his office and to keep an eye on the suit property of the appellant. Therefore, the suit property was given to the respondent only as a caretaker. 11. The respondent executed a leave and licence agreement in the name of his wife to shift with his family out of the suit property completely on 1.4.1991 to Campo Verde Apartments at Caranzalem in Goa. The leave and licence agreement executed by the respondent\u2019s wife for the new house wherein the respondent and his family shifted on 1.4.1991 and thereafter got the agreement renewed on 7.3.1992. The respondent also owned one flat in Goa and occupied on 17.4. 1991. 12. According to the appellant, the respondent handed over the suit property to his sister Maria in the first week of May, 1991 and requested her that some items which were already lying in the suit property which the respondent did not immediately require in his new place may be kept in the suit property. According to the appellant, her brother before shifting to the tenanted flat, handed over the keys of the house to the appellant. The appellant did not take any receipt from her brother or click a photograph to create evidence showing handing over of the custodian possession of the suit property. The respondent shifted to his new flat and the suit property was lying almost vacant because the appellant along with her husband was living outside Goa on his different official postings.   13. According to the appellant, the details of electricity, water and telephone bills clearly demonstrate that the house was locked and the small amounts payable in the said months, i.e., August, September, October and November in the year 1991, February 1992 also showed very nominal payments of Rs.30/-, Rs.33/-, Rs.68/- which conclusively proved that a house comprising of several rooms, drawing, dining, bathrooms, verandah, lawns etc. was lying vacant. 14. On 20.5.1992, the appellant returned with her family to Goa and occupied and enjoyed the said suit property. The appellant submitted that she has a valid title/ownership and was in possession of the suit property and she could not be dispossessed by a Court in a suit for injunction. The appellant submitted that under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act, the appellant could not have been legally compelled to hand over the possession to the respondent. It may be pertinent to mention that the respondent had filed a suit for injunction before the Trial Court. The Trial Court granted injunction in favour of the respondent and the same was upheld by the High Court in the impugned judgment in Civil Revision Application. 15. According to the appellant, the impugned judgment of the High Court by which the judgment of the Trial Court was affirmed is totally contrary to the law laid down by this Court in Mahabir Prasad Jain v. Ganga Singh (1999) 8 SCC 274. It was also asserted by the appellant that this Court in the aforementioned case has laid down the parameters of Section 6 of the Special Relief Act, 1963. In the instant case, the Courts below were oblivious of the principle under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act. The appellant urged that the respondent\u2019s suit for injunction was not maintainable as he could not claim to be in lawful and legal possession of the premises at all. The appellant argued that the Courts below have missed the main issue as the respondent was merely in custody of the house on behalf of the appellant. According to her, a caretaker can never sue a valid title-holder of the property. 16. The appellant further urged that a caretaker\u2019s possession can never be a possession of individual\u2019s right and no such suit for injunction under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act was maintainable. The appellant contended that the respondent returned the keys of the suit property sometime in May 1991. The appellant asserted that the respondent had manipulated the system and collected false and fabricated evidence in the form of Panchnama in collusion with the local police and was designed to throw out the appellant from her own house. 17. On 17.6.1992, the respondent filed a suit for permanent and mandatory injunction in the Court of Civil Judge, Senior Division at Panaji as a Special Civil Suit No.131/92/A. On 22.6.1992, an ex-parte order for depositing the keys was passed while the appellant and her family members were living in the suit premises. The Trial Court decreed the suit.   18. According to the appellant, the impugned judgment of the High Court is contrary to the ratio of the judgment of this Court in Rame Gowda (dead) by LRs. v. M. Varadappa Naidu (dead) by LRs. and Another (2004) 1 SCC 769 wherein a three-Judge Bench of this Court has observed that possession is no good against the rightful owner and that the assumption that he is in peaceful possession will not work and cannot operate against the true lawful owner. 19. Reliance has also been placed by the appellant on Southern Roadways Ltd., Madurai v. S.M. Krishnan (1989) 4 SCC 603 wherein this Court has held that it is the settled law that agent has no possession of his own and caretaker\u2019s possession is the possession of the principal. This Court has taken the view that possession of the agent is the possession of the principal and in view of the fiduciary relationship, the agent cannot be permitted to claim his own possession. Thus, according to the appellant, the respondent had no right, title and/or interest in the suit property and was not in lawful possession. Therefore, the suit for injunction under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act is totally misconceived. The appellant contended that the High Court in the impugned judgment has gravely erred in affirming the judgment of the Trial Court. 20. According to the case of the respondent, he was permitted to live in the suit premises because of the family arrangement. The respondent remained in possession of the suit property for several years and hence he cannot be dispossessed without following due process of law. 21. It is also submitted by the respondent that he was in possession of the suit premises for 28 years and was forcibly dispossessed on 15.6.1992. The respondent also submitted that he never conceded that the title of the suit property was with the appellant. He also submitted that it is contrary to the records that the respondent was a caretaker. 22. The learned counsel for the parties reiterated the submissions made before the Courts below. The appellant submitted that she is a helpless and hapless sister of the respondent who has been kept out from her own house for more than two decades. The appellant is the owner of the suit property which is evident from the Certificate of the Probate Proceedings known as Inventory Proceeding No.1075/935. She further submitted that the respondent, her brother, was a party in the said Probate Proceedings where the appellant acquired the title of the suit property on 27.5.1972. The respondent collected the sale consideration amount on 17th March, 1972 vide Cheque No.33559 drawn on Bank of India on behalf of his aunt in the auction proceedings.   23. The appellant submitted that the City Civil Court held that the appellant is the owner of the suit property and has the title and possession of the same which was never challenged by the respondent. The appellant also submitted that apart from the title of the suit property, house tax records and wealth tax records indicate that she was and continued to be the owner of the suit property. She further submitted that the utility bills of electricity, water and telephone were of minimal amount which show that the respondent had never resided in the suit premises. The appellant submitted that the finding of the Trial Court that the appellant had no funds to purchase the property was contrary to record. The High Court has also erroneously affirmed the findings of the Trial Court. 24. The appellant urged that the suit filed by the respondent is not based on title. The family arrangement, as alleged by the respondent, is neither pleaded nor proved. The appellant asserted that no suit under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act lies against the true owner. The appellant submitted that a caretaker, agent, guardian etc. cannot file a suit under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act. 25. According to law laid down by this Court in Rame Gowda (dead) by LRs. (supra), it is the settled legal position that a possessory suit is good against the whole world except the rightful owner. It is not maintainable against the true owner. 26. This Court in Anima Mallick v. Ajoy Kumar Roy and Another (2000) 4 SCC 119 held that where the sister gave possession as gratuitous to the brother, this Court restored possession to the sister as it was purely gratuitous basis and the sister could have reclaimed possession even without knowledge of the brother. 27. According to the appellant, this Court in Sopan Sukhdeo Sable and Others v. Assistant Charity Commissioner and Others (2004) 3 SCC 137 has observed that no injunction can be granted against the true owner and Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act cannot be invoked to protect the wrongdoer who suppressed the material facts from the Courts. 28. The appellant submitted that Section 41 of the Specific Relief Act debars any relief to be given to such an erring person as the respondent who is guilty of suppression of material facts. 29. The appellant relied on Automobile Products India Limited v. Das John Peter and Others (2010) 12 SCC 593 and Ramrameshwari Devi and Others v. Nirmala Devi and Others (2011) 8 SCC 249 where the Court has laid down that dilatory tactics, misconceived injunction suits create only incentives for wrongdoers. 30. The appellant submitted that for more than two decades the appellant is without the possession of her own house despite the fact that she has valid title to the suit property. Truth as guiding star in judicial process 31. In this unfortunate litigation, the Court\u2019s serious endeavour has to be to find out where in fact the truth lies. The truth should be the guiding star in the entire judicial process. 32. Truth alone has to be the foundation of justice. The entire judicial system has been created only to discern and find out the real truth. Judges at all levels have to seriously engage themselves in the journey of discovering the truth. That is their mandate, obligation and bounden duty. 33. Justice system will acquire credibility only when people will be convinced that justice is based on the foundation of the truth. 34. In Mohanlal Shamji Soni v. Union of India 1991 Supp (1) SCC 271, this Court observed that in such a situation a question that arises for consideration is whether the presiding officer of a Court should simply sit as a mere umpire at a contest between two parties and declare at the end of the combat who has won and who has lost or is there not any legal duty of his own, independent of the parties, to take an active role in the proceedings in finding the truth and administering justice? It is a well accepted and settled principle that a Court must discharge its statutory functions- whether discretionary or obligatory-according to law in dispensing justice because it is the duty of a Court not only to do justice but also to ensure that justice is being done. 35. What people expect is that the Court should discharge its obligation to find out where in fact the truth lies. Right from inception of the judicial system it has been accepted that discovery, vindication and establishment of truth are the main purposes underlying the existence of the courts of justice. 36. In Ritesh Tewari and Another v. State of U.P. and Others (2010) 10 SCC 677 this Court reproduced often quoted quotation which reads as under: \u201cEvery trial is voyage of discovery in which truth is the quest\u201d 37. This Court observed that the power is to be exercised with an object to subserve the cause of justice and public interest and for getting the evidence in aid of a just decision and to uphold the truth. 38. Lord Denning, in the case of Jones v. National Coal Board [1957] 2 QB 55 has observed that: \u201cIn the system of trial that we evolved in this country, the Judge sits to hear and determine the issues raised by the parties, not to conduct an investigation or examination on behalf of the society at large, as happens, we believe, in some foreign countries.\u201d 39. Certainly, the above, is not true of the Indian Judicial system. A judge in the Indian System has to be regarded as failing to exercise its jurisdiction and thereby discharging its judicial duty, if in the guise of remaining neutral, he opts to remain passive to the proceedings before him. He has to always keep in mind that \u201cevery trial is a voyage of discovery in which truth is the quest\u201d. In order to bring on record the relevant fact, he has to play an active role; no doubt within the bounds of the statutorily defined procedural law. 40. Lord Denning further observed in the said case of Jones (supra) that \u201c`It\u2019s all very well to paint justice blind, but she does better without a bandage round her eyes. She should be blind indeed to favour or prejudice, but clear to see which way lies the truth\u2026\u201d 41. World over, modern procedural Codes are increasingly relying on full disclosure by the parties. Managerial powers of the Judge are being deployed to ensure that the scope of the factual controversy is minimized. 42. In civil cases, adherence to Section 30 CPC would also help in ascertaining the truth. It seems that this provision which ought to be frequently used is rarely pressed in service by our judicial officers and judges. Section 30 CPC reads as under:- 30. Power to order discovery and the like. \u2013 Subject to such conditions and limitations as may be prescribed, the Court may, at any time either of its own motion or on the application of any party, \u2013 (a) make such orders as may be necessary or reasonable in all matters relating to the delivery and answering of interrogatories, the admission of documents and facts, and the discovery, inspection, production, impounding and return of documents or other material objects producible as evidence; (b) issue summons to persons whose attendance is required either to give evidence or to produce documents or such other objects as aforesaid; (c) order any fact to be proved by affidavit 43. \u201cSatyameva Jayate\u201d (Literally: \u201cTruth Stands Invincible\u201d) is a mantra from the ancient scripture Mundaka Upanishad. Upon independence of India, it was adopted as the national motto of India. It is inscribed in Devanagari script at the base of the national emblem. The meaning of full mantra is as follows: \u201cTruth alone triumphs; not falsehood. Through truth the divine path is spread out by which the sages whose desires have been completely fulfilled, reach where that supreme treasure of Truth resides.\u201d 44. Malimath Committee on Judicial Reforms heavily relied on the fact that in discovering truth, the judges of all Courts need to play an active role. The Committee observed thus: 2.2 In the adversarial system truth is supposed to emerge from the respective versions of the facts presented by the prosecution and the defence before a neutral judge. The judge acts like an umpire to see whether the prosecution has been able to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. The State discharges the obligation to protect life, liberty and property of the citizens by taking suitable preventive and punitive measures which also serve the object of preventing private retribution so essential for maintenance of peace and law and order in the society doubt and gives the benefit of doubt to the accused. It is the parties that determine the scope of dispute and decide largely, autonomously and in a selective manner on the evidence that they decide to present to the court. The trial is oral, continuous and confrontational. The parties use cross-examination of witnesses to undermine the opposing case and to discover information the other side has not brought out. The judge in his anxiety to maintain his position of neutrality never takes any initiative to discover truth. He does not correct the aberrations in the investigation or in the matter of production of evidence before court 2.16.9. Truth being the cherished ideal and ethos of India, pursuit of truth should be the guiding star of the Criminal Justice System. For justice to be done truth must prevail. It is truth that must protect the innocent and it is truth that must be the basis to punish the guilty. Truth is the very soul of justice. Therefore truth should become the ideal to inspire the courts to pursue. This can be achieved by statutorily mandating the courts to become active seekers of truth. It is of seminal importance to inject vitality into our system if we have to regain the lost confidence of the people. Concern for and duty to seek truth should not become the limited concern of the courts. It should become the paramount duty of everyone to assist the court in its quest for truth. 45. In Chandra Shashi v. Anil Kumar Verma (1995) 1 SCC 421 to enable the Courts to ward off unjustified interference in their working, those who indulge in immoral acts like perjury, pre-variation and motivated falsehoods have to be appropriately dealt with, without which it would not be possible for any Court to administer justice in the true sense and to the satisfaction of those who approach it in the hope that truth would ultimately prevail. People would have faith in Courts when they would find that truth alone triumphs in Courts. 46. Truth has been foundation of other judicial systems, such as, the United States of America, the United Kingdom and other countries. 47. In James v. Giles et al. v. State of Maryland 386 U.S. 66, 87, S.Ct. 793), the US Supreme Court, in ruling on the conduct of prosecution in suppressing evidence favourable to the defendants and use of perjured testimony held that such rules existed for a purpose as a necessary component of the search for truth and justice that judges, like prosecutors must undertake. It further held that the State\u2019s obligation under the Due Process Clause \u201cis not to convict, but to see that so far as possible, truth emerges.\u201d 48. The obligation to pursue truth has been carried to extremes. Thus, in United States v. J.Lee Havens 446 U.S. 620, 100 St.Ct. 1912, it was held that the government may use illegally obtained evidence to impeach a defendant\u2019s fraudulent statements during cross-examination for the purpose of seeking justice, for the purpose of \u201carriving at the truth, which is a fundamental goal of our legal system\u201d. 49. Justice Cardozo in his widely read and appreciated book \u201cThe Nature of the Judicial Process\u201d discusses the role of the judges. The relevant part is reproduced as under:- \u201cThere has been a certain lack of candour,\u201d \u201cin much of the discussion of the theme [of judges\u2019 humanity], or rather perhaps in the refusal to discuss it, as if judges must lose respect and confidence by the reminder that they are subject to human limitations.\u201d I do not doubt the grandeur of conception which lifts them into the realm of pure reason, above and beyond the sweep of perturbing and deflecting forces. None the less, if there is anything of reality in my analysis of the judicial process, they do not stand aloof on these chill and distant heights; and we shall not help the cause of truth by acting and speaking as if they do.\u201d 50. Aharon Barak, President of Israeli Supreme Court from 1995 to 2006 takes the position that: \u201cFor issues in which stability is actually more important than the substance of the solution \u2013 and there are many such case \u2013 I will join the majority, without restating my dissent each time. Only when my dissenting opinion reflects an issue that is central for me \u2013 that goes to the core of my role as a judge \u2013 will I not capitulate, and will I continue to restate my dissenting opinion: \u201cTruth or stability \u2013 truth is preferable\u201d. \u201cOn the contrary, public confidence means ruling according to the law and according to the judge\u2019s conscience, whatever the attitude of the public may be. Public confidence means giving expression to history, not to hysteria. Public confidence is ensured by the recognition that the judge is doing justice within the framework of the law and its provisions. Judges must act \u2013 inside and outside the court \u2013 in a manner that preserves public confidence in them. They must understand that judging is not merely a job but a way of life. It is a way of life that does not include the pursuit of material wealth or publicity; it is a way of life based on spiritual wealth; it is a way of life that includes an objective and impartial search for truth.\u201d 51. In the administration of justice, judges and lawyers play equal roles. Like judges, lawyers also must ensure that truth triumphs in the administration of justice. 52. Truth is the foundation of justice. It must be the endeavour of all the judicial officers and judges to ascertain truth in every matter and no stone should be left unturned in achieving this object. Courts must give greater emphasis on the veracity of pleadings and documents in order to ascertain the truth. Pleadings 53. Pleadings are the foundation of litigation. In pleadings, only the necessary and relevant material must be included and unnecessary and irrelevant material must be excluded. Pleadings are given utmost importance in similar systems of adjudication, such as, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. 54. In the United Kingdom, after the Woolf Report, Civil Procedure Rules, 1998 were enacted. Rule 3.4(2) has some relevance and the same is reproduced as under: (2) The Court may strike out a statement of case if it appears to the Court \u2013 (a) that the statement of case discloses no reasonable grounds for bringing or defending the claim; (b) that the statement of case is an abuse of the Court\u2019s process or is otherwise likely to obstruct the just disposal of the proceedings; or (c) that there has been a failure to comply with a rule, practice direction or Court order. 55. In so far as denials are concerned, Rule 16.5 provides that where the defendant denies an allegation, he must state his reasons for doing so, and if he intends to put forward a different version of events from that given by the plaintiff, he must state his own version. 56. The various practice directions and prescribed forms give an indication of the particulars required. In fact, the 1998 Rules go further and provide for summary judgment. Rule 24.2 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 1998 reads as under: 24.2 The Court may give summary judgment against a claimant or defendant on the whole of a claim or on a particular issue if- (a) it considers that- (i) that claimant has no real prospect of succeeding on the claim or issue; or (ii) that defendant has no real prospect of successfully defending the claim or issue; and (b) there is no other compelling reason why the case or issue should be disposed of at a trial. 57. After enactment of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998, much greater emphasis is given on pleadings in the United Kingdom. Similarly, in the United States of America, much greater emphasis is given on pleadings, particularly after two well known decisions of the US Supreme Court, viz., Bell Atlantic Corporation et al. v. William Twombly [550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955] and John. D. Ashcroft, Former Attorney General, et al. v. Javaid Iqbal et al. [556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct.1937]. 58. In Bell Atlantic (supra), the Court has observed that factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level. The pleadings must contain something more than a statement of facts that merely creates a suspicion of a legally cognizable right of action. 59. In Ashcroft (supra) the majority Judges of the U.S. Supreme Court observed as under: \u201cThreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice. Although for the purposes of a motion to dismiss we must take all of the factual allegations in the complaint as a true, we are not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss.\u201d 60. The aforementioned two decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court re-emphasized and reiterated the importance of pleadings. 61. In civil cases, pleadings are extremely important for ascertaining the title and possession of the property in question. 62. Possession is an incidence of ownership and can be transferred by the owner of an immovable property to another such as in a mortgage or lease. A licensee holds possession on behalf of the owner. 63. Possession is important when there are no title documents and other relevant records before the Court, but, once the documents and records of title come before the Court, it is the title which has to be looked at first and due weightage be given to it. Possession cannot be considered in vacuum. 64. There is a presumption that possession of a person, other than the owner, if at all it is to be called possession, is permissive on behalf of the title-holder. Further, possession of the past is one thing, and the right to remain or continue in future is another thing. It is the latter which is usually more in controversy than the former, and it is the latter which has seen much abuse and misuse before the Courts. 65. A suit can be filed by the title holder for recovery of possession or it can be one for ejectment of an ex-lessee or for mandatory injunction requiring a person to remove himself or it can be a suit under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act to recover possession. 66. A title suit for possession has two parts \u2013 first, adjudication of title, and second, adjudication of possession. If the title dispute is removed and the title is established in one or the other, then, in effect, it becomes a suit for ejectment where the defendant must plead and prove why he must not be ejected. 67. In an action for recovery of possession of immovable property, or for protecting possession thereof, upon the legal title to the property being established, the possession or occupation of the property by a person other than the holder of the legal title will be presumed to have been under and in subordination to the legal title, and it will be for the person resisting a claim for recovery of possession or claiming a right to continue in possession, to establish that he has such a right. To put it differently, wherever pleadings and documents establish title to a particular property and possession is in question, it will be for the person in possession to give sufficiently detailed pleadings, particulars and documents to support his claim in order to continue in possession. 68. In order to do justice, it is necessary to direct the parties to give all details of pleadings with particulars. Once the title is prima facie established, it is for the person who is resisting the title holder\u2019s claim to possession to plead with sufficient particularity on the basis of his claim to remain in possession and place before the Court all such documents as in the ordinary course of human affairs are expected to be there. Only if the pleadings are sufficient, would an issue be struck and the matter sent to trial, where the onus will be on him to prove the averred facts and documents. 69. The person averring a right to continue in possession shall, as far as possible, give a detailed particularized specific pleading along with documents to support his claim and details of subsequent conduct which establish his possession. 70. It would be imperative that one who claims possession must give all such details as enumerated hereunder. They are only illustrative and not exhaustive. (a) who is or are the owner or owners of the property; (b) title of the property; (c) who is in possession of the title documents (d) identity of the claimant or claimants to possession; (e) the date of entry into possession; (f) how he came into possession \u2013 whether he purchased the property or inherited or got the same in gift or by any other method; (g) in case he purchased the property, what is the consideration; if he has taken it on rent, how much is the rent, license fee or lease amount; (h) If taken on rent, license fee or lease \u2013 then insist on rent deed, license deed or lease deed; (i) who are the persons in possession/occupation or otherwise living with him, in what capacity; as family members, friends or servants etc.; (j) subsequent conduct, i.e., any event which might have extinguished his entitlement to possession or caused shift therein; and (k) basis of his claim that not to deliver possession but continue in possession. 71. Apart from these pleadings, the Court must insist on documentary proof in support of the pleadings. All those documents would be relevant which come into existence after the transfer of title or possession or the encumbrance as is claimed. While dealing with the civil suits, at the threshold, the Court must carefully and critically examine pleadings and documents. 72. The Court will examine the pleadings for specificity as also the supporting material for sufficiency and then pass appropriate orders. 73. Discovery and production of documents and answers to interrogatories, together with an approach of considering what in ordinary course of human affairs is more likely to have been the probability, will prevent many a false claims or defences from sailing beyond the stage for issues. 74. If the pleadings do not give sufficient details, they will not raise an issue, and the Court can reject the claim or pass a decree on admission. 75. On vague pleadings, no issue arises. Only when he so establishes, does the question of framing an issue arise. Framing of issues is an extremely important stage in a civil trial. Judges are expected to carefully examine the pleadings and documents before framing of issues in a given case. 76. In pleadings, whenever a person claims right to continue in possession of another property, it becomes necessary for him to plead with specificity about who was the owner, on what date did he enter into possession, in what capacity and in what manner did he conduct his relationship with the owner over the years till the date of suit. He must also give details on what basis he is claiming a right to continue in possession. Until the pleadings raise a sufficient case, they will not constitute sufficient claim of defence. 77. Dr. Arun Mohan in his classic treatise on \u201cJustice, Courts and Delays\u201d has dealt with these fundamental principles of law exhaustively. 78. The Court must ensure that pleadings of a case must contain sufficient particulars. Insistence on details reduces the ability to put forward a non-existent or false claim or defence. 79. In dealing with a civil case, pleadings, title documents and relevant records play a vital role and that would ordinarily decide the fate of the case. Suit for Mandatory Injunction 80. It is a settled principle of law that no one can take law in his own hands. Even a trespasser in settled possession cannot be dispossessed without recourse of law. It must be the endeavour of the Court that if a suit for mandatory injunction is filed, then it is its bounden duty and obligation to critically examine the pleadings and documents and pass an order of injunction while taking pragmatic realities including prevalent market rent of similar premises in similar localities in consideration. The Court\u2019s primary concern has to be to do substantial justice. Even if the Court in an extraordinary case decides to grant ex-parte ad interim injunction in favour of the plaintiff who does not have a clear title, then at least the plaintiff be directed to give an undertaking that in case the suit is ultimately dismissed, then he would be required to pay market rent of the property from the date when an ad interim injunction was obtained by him. It is the duty and the obligation of the Court to at least dispose off application of grant of injunction as expeditiously as possible. It is the demand of equity and justice. Due process of Law 81. Due process of law means nobody ought to be condemned unheard. The due process of law means a person in settled possession will not be dispossessed except by due process of law. Due process means an opportunity for the defendant to file pleadings including written statement and documents before the Court of law. It does not mean the whole trial. Due process of law is satisfied the moment rights of the parties are adjudicated by a competent Court. 82. The High Court of Delhi in a case Thomas Cook (India) Limited v. Hotel Imperial 2006 (88) DRJ 545 held as under: \u201c28. The expressions `due process of law\u2019, `due course of law\u2019 and `recourse to law\u2019 have been interchangeably used in the decisions referred to above which say that the settled possession of even a person in unlawful possession cannot be disturbed `forcibly\u2019 by the true owner taking law in his own hands. All these expressions, however, mean the same thing \u2014 ejectment from settled possession can only be had by recourse to a court of law. Clearly, `due process of law\u2019 or `due course of law\u2019, here, simply mean that a person in settled possession cannot be ejected without a court of law having adjudicated upon his rights qua the true owner. Now, this `due process\u2019 or `due course\u2019 condition is satisfied the moment the rights of the parties are adjudicated upon by a court of competent jurisdiction. It does not matter who brought the action to court. It could be the owner in an action for enforcement of his right to eject the person in unlawful possession. It could be the person who is sought to be ejected, in an action preventing the owner from ejecting him. Whether the action is for enforcement of a right (recovery of possession) or protection of a right (injunction against dispossession), is not of much consequence. What is important is that in either event it is an action before the court and the court adjudicates upon it. If that is done then, the `bare minimum\u2019 requirement of `due process\u2019 or `due course\u2019 of law would stand satisfied as recourse to law would have been taken. In this context, when a party approaches a court seeking a protective remedy such as an injunction and it fails in setting up a good case, can it then say that the other party must now institute an action in a court of law for enforcing his rights i.e., for taking back something from the first party who holds it unlawfully, and, till such time, the court hearing the injunction action must grant an injunction anyway? I would think not. In any event, the `recourse to law\u2019 stipulation stands satisfied when a judicial determination is made with regard to the first party\u2019s protective action. Thus, in the present case, the plaintiff\u2019s failure to make out a case for an injunction does not mean that its consequent cessation of user of the said two rooms would have been brought about without recourse to law.\u201d 83. We approve the findings of the High Court of Delhi on this issue in the aforesaid case. False claims and false defences 84. False claims and defences are really serious problems with real estate litigation, predominantly because of ever escalating prices of the real estate. Litigation pertaining to valuable real estate properties is dragged on by unscrupulous litigants in the hope that the other party will tire out and ultimately would settle with them by paying a huge amount. This happens because of the enormous delay in adjudication of cases in our Courts. If pragmatic approach is adopted, then this problem can be minimized to a large extent. 85. This Court in a recent judgment in Ramrameshwari Devi and Others (supra) aptly observed at page 266 that unless wrongdoers are denied profit from frivolous litigation, it would be difficult to prevent it. In order to curb uncalled for and frivolous litigation, the Courts have to ensure that there is no incentive or motive for uncalled for litigation. It is a matter of common experience that Court\u2019s otherwise scarce time is consumed or more appropriately, wasted in a large number of uncalled for cases. In this very judgment, the Court provided that this problem can be solved or at least be minimized if exemplary cost is imposed for instituting frivolous litigation. The Court observed at pages 267-268 that imposition of actual, realistic or proper costs and/or ordering prosecution in appropriate cases would go a long way in controlling the tendency of introducing false pleadings and forged and fabricated documents by the litigants. Imposition of heavy costs would also control unnecessary adjournments by the parties. In appropriate cases, the Courts may consider ordering prosecution otherwise it may not be possible to maintain purity and sanctity of judicial proceedings. Grant or refusal of an injunction 86. Grant or refusal of an injunction in a civil suit is the most important stage in the civil trial. Due care, caution, diligence and attention must be bestowed by the judicial officers and judges while granting or refusing injunction. In most cases, the fate of the case is decided by grant or refusal of an injunction. Experience has shown that once an injunction is granted, getting it vacated would become a nightmare for the defendant. In order to grant or refuse injunction, the judicial officer or the judge must carefully examine the entire pleadings and documents with utmost care and seriousness. 87. The safe and better course is to give short notice on injunction application and pass an appropriate order after hearing both the sides. In case of grave urgency, if it becomes imperative to grant an ex-parte ad interim injunction, it should be granted for a specified period, such as, for two weeks. In those cases, the plaintiff will have no inherent interest in delaying disposal of injunction application after obtaining an ex-parte ad interim injunction. The Court, in order to avoid abuse of the process of law may also record in the injunction order that if the suit is eventually dismissed, the plaintiff undertakes to pay restitution, actual or realistic costs. While passing the order, the Court must take into consideration the pragmatic realities and pass proper order for mesne profits. The Court must make serious endeavour to ensure that even-handed justice is given to both the parties. 88. Ordinarily, three main principles govern the grant or refusal of injunction. (a) prima facie case; (b) balance of convenience; and (c) irreparable injury, which guide the Court in this regard. 89. In the broad category of prima facie case, it is imperative for the Court to carefully analyse the pleadings and the documents on record and only on that basis the Court must be governed by the prima facie case. In grant and refusal of injunction, pleadings and documents play vital role. Mesne Profits 90. Experience has shown that all kinds of pleadings are introduced and even false and fabricated documents are filed in civil cases because there is an inherent profit in continuation of possession. In a large number of cases, honest litigants suffer and dishonest litigants get undue benefit by grant or refusal of an injunction because the Courts do not critically examine pleadings and documents on record. In case while granting or refusing injunction, the Court properly considers pleadings and documents and takes the pragmatic view and grants appropriate mesne profit, then the inherent interest to continue frivolous litigation by unscrupulous litigants would be reduced to a large extent. 91. The Court while granting injunction should broadly take into consideration the prevailing market rentals in the locality for similar premises. Based on that, the Court should fix adhoc amount which the person continuing in possession must pay and on such payment, the plaintiff may withdraw after furnishing an undertaking and also making it clear that should the Court pass any order for reimbursement, it will be a charge upon the property. 92. The Court can also direct payment of a particular amount and for a differential, direct furnishing of a security by the person who wishes to continue in possession. If such amount, as may be fixed by the Court, is not paid as security, the Court may remove the person and appoint a receiver of the property or strike out the claim or defence. This is a very important exercise for balancing equities. Courts must carry out this exercise with extreme care and caution while keeping pragmatic realities in mind and make a proper order of granting mesne profit. This is the requirement of equity and justice. 93. In the instant case, if the Courts below would have carefully looked into the pleadings, documents and had applied principle of the grant of mesne profit, then injustice and illegality would not have perpetuated for more than two decades. 94. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at length and perused the relevant judgments cited at the Bar. In the instant case, admittedly, the respondent did not claim any title to the suit property. Undoubtedly, the appellant has a valid title to the property which is clearly proved from the pleadings and documents on record. 95. The respondent has not been able to establish the family arrangement by which this house was given to the respondent for his residence. The Courts below have failed to appreciate that the premises in question was given by the appellant to her brother respondent herein as a caretaker. The appellant was married to a Naval Officer who was transferred from time to time outside Goa. Therefore, on the request of her brother she gave possession of the premises to him as a caretaker. The caretaker holds the property of the principal only on behalf of the principal. 96. The respondent\u2019s suit for injunction against the true owner \u2013 the appellant was not maintainable, particularly when it was established beyond doubt that the respondent was only a caretaker and he ought to have given possession of the premises to the true owner of the suit property on demand. Admittedly, the respondent does not claim any title over the suit property and he had not filed any proceedings disputing the title of the appellant. 97. This Court in Puran Singh v. The State of Punjab (1975) 4 SCC 518 held that an occupation of the property by a person as an agent or a servant at the instance of the owner will not amount to actual physical possession. 98. This Court in Mahabir Prasad Jain (supra) has held that the possession of a servant or agent is that of his master or principal as the case may be for all purposes and the former cannot maintain a suit against the latter on the basis of such possession. 99. In Sham Lal v. Rajinder Kumar & Others 1994 (30) DRJ 596, the High Court of Delhi held thus: \u201cOn the basis of the material available on record, it will be a misnomer to say that the plaintiff has been in \u2018possession\u2019 of the suit property. The plaintiff is neither a tenant, nor a licensee, nor a person even in unlawful possession of the suit property. Possession of servant is possession of the real owner. A servant cannot be said to be having any interest in the suit property. It cannot be said that a servant or a chowkidar can exercise such a possession or right to possession over the property as to exclude the master and the real owner of the property from his possession or exercising right to possession over the property. Possession is flexible term and is not necessarily restricted to mere actual possession of the property. The legal conception of possession may be in various forms. The two elements of possession are the corpus and the animus. A person though in physical possession may not be in possession in the eye of law, if the animus be lacking. On the contrary, to be in possession, it is not necessary that one must be in actual physical contact. To gain the complete idea of possession, one must consider (i) the person possessing, (ii) the things possessed and, (iii) the persons excluded from possession. A man may hold an object without claiming any interest therein for himself. A servant though holding an object, holds it for his master. He has, therefore, merely custody of the thing and not the possession which would always be with the master though the master may not be in actual contact of the thing. It is in this light in which the concept of possession has to be understood in the context of a servant and & master.\u201d 100. The ratio of this judgment in Sham Lal (supra) is that merely because the plaintiff was employed as a servant or chowkidar to look after the property, it cannot be said that he had entered into such possession of the property as would entitle him to exclude even the master from enjoying or claiming possession of the property or as would entitle him to compel the master from staying away from his own property. 101. Principles of law which emerge in this case are crystallized as under:- 1. No one acquires title to the property if he or she was allowed to stay in the premises gratuitously. Even by long possession of years or decades such person would not acquire any right or interest in the said property. 2. Caretaker, watchman or servant can never acquire interest in the property irrespective of his long possession. The caretaker or servant has to give possession forthwith on demand. 3. The Courts are not justified in protecting the possession of a caretaker, servant or any person who was allowed to live in the premises for some time either as a friend, relative, caretaker or as a servant. 4. The protection of the Court can only be granted or extended to the person who has valid, subsisting rent agreement, lease agreement or license agreement in his favour. 5. The caretaker or agent holds property of the principal only on behalf of the principal. He acquires no right or interest whatsoever for himself in such property irrespective of his long stay or possession. 102. In this view of the matter, the impugned judgment of the High Court as also of the Trial Court deserve to be set aside and we accordingly do so. Consequently, this Court directs that the possession of the suit premises be handed over to the appellant, who is admittedly the owner of the suit property. 103. In the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, the legal representatives of the respondent are granted three months time to vacate the suit premises. They are further directed that after the expiry of the three months period, the vacant and peaceful possession of the suit property be handed over to the appellant. The usual undertaking to this effect be filed by the legal representatives of the respondent in this Court within two weeks. 104. The legal representatives of the respondent are also directed to pay Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rupees one Lakh) per month towards the use and occupation of the premises for a period of three months. The said amount for use and occupation be given to the appellant on or before the 10th of every month. In case the legal representatives of the respondent are not willing to pay the amount for use and occupation as directed by this Court, they must hand over the possession of the premises within two weeks from the date of this judgment. Thereafter, if the legal representatives of the respondent do not hand over peaceful possession of the suit property, in that event, the appellant would be at liberty to get the possession of the premises by taking police help. 105. As a result, the appeal of the appellant is allowed. In the facts and circumstances of the case, the respondents are directed to pay a cost of Rs.50,000/- to the appellant within four weeks. (We have imposed the moderate cost in view of the fact that the original respondent has expired). Ordered accordingly."

The procedure for each case is as follows: ===================================================================================== Supreme Court sets alimony benchmark: 25% of ex-husband\u2019s net salary The Supreme Court has set a benchmark for maintenance to be paid by a husband to his estranged wife, stating that 25% of his net salary might constitute a \"just and proper\" amount as alimony. A bench of Justices R Banumathi and M M Santanagoudar made the observation while directing a resident of West Bengal's Hoogly, earning Rs 95,527 a month, to set aside Rs 20,000 as maintenance for his former wife and their son, turning down the man's plea that the amount was excessive. The court said the amount of maintenance or permanent alimony must be sufficient to ensure that a woman lived with dignity after separating from her husband. =========================================================================== MAINTENANCE AND CUSTODY THE LEGAL rules relating to the maintenance and custody of children are found in the personal laws (including statutory) of the various religious communities, and in the Criminal Procedure Code. There is, therefore, no uniformity in this matter except to the limited extent to which the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code apply. We shall first deal with the latter and then proceed to examine the personal laws of the different religious communities. ======================================================================= Section 20 in The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 20. Monetary reliefs.\u2014 (1) While disposing of an application under sub-section (1) of section 12, the Magistrate may direct the respondent to pay monetary relief to meet the expenses incurred and losses suffered by the aggrieved person and any child of the aggrieved person as a result of the domestic violence and such relief may include but is not limited to\u2014 (a) the loss of earnings; (b) the medical expenses; (c) the loss caused due to the destruction, damage or removal of any property from the control of the aggrieved person; and ======================================================================== Section 498A in The Indian Penal Code 376 [498A. Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty.\u2014Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be pun\u00adished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine. Explanation.\u2014For the purpose of this section, \u201ccruelty\u201d means\u2014 (a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or (b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand.]"

Dispensing away the doubts as to its legal status, a division bench of the Delhi High Court in a recent decision has explained the legal position of marriage between minor couples. Holding that traditionally the valid between minors has been taken as neither void or voidable and on the contrary a legally valid marriage, the law was changed in 2006 by the Parliament with the enactment of the Prohibition of Child marriage Act, 2006 wherein under such marriages were made voidable at the option of the minor spouse. The prohibition of child marriage act, 2006 has no retrospective effect. \u201c11. Void marriages.\u2014Any marriage solemnized after the commencement of this Act shall be null and void and may, on a petition presented by either party thereto against the other party, be so declared by a decree of nullity if it contravenes any one of the conditions specified in clauses (i), (iv) and (v) of Section 5. Though five conditions have been stipulated in section 5, only the contravention of three of them, namely, clauses (i), (iv) and (v) would render the marriage to be null and void. Clause (iii) of section 5, which is the condition with regard to the minimum ages of the bride and bridegroom, is conspicuous by its absence. As a result, a Hindu marriage solemnized in contravention of clause (iii) of section 5 of the HMA cannot be regarded as a void or invalid marriage. Every child marriage, whether solemnised before or after the commencement of this Act, shall be voidable at the option of the contracting party who was a child at the time of the marriage: Provided that a petition for annulling a child marriage by a decree of nullity may be filed in the district court only by a contracting party to the marriage who was a child at the time of the marriage. (2) If at the time of filing a petition, the petitioner is a minor, the petition may be filed through his or her guardian or next friend along with the Child Marriage Prohibition Officer. (3)The petition under this section may be filed at any time but before the child filling the petition completes two years of attaining majority."

Though all the payments use to happen through RTGS, some payments got delayed due to cash flow crunch. All this happened when our company was making losses and ultimately had to shut operations. This trader then utilized our security cheques and had filed five sec138 cases against our company for 5 cheques in Tis hazari court Delhi. I have a few confusions regarding the same:       1. The cases have been filed against both directors, one of whom is a senior citizen lady who had been a director on papers and had no role in day to day operations or cheque signing. Does she also need to appear and seek bail? is there an option available for seeking permanent exemption for her from high court, if so, what is the procedure?      2. We consulted a lawyer and he is of the opinion that for seeking bail , you need to furnish security bonds which are atleast 10% of value of the cheque bounced amount. So for cheques worth 90L, do we need to have 9L security bonds for each accused?      3. What should be the ideal defence for us while fighting the case? All security cheques have same amount and dates filled by the trader? will this stand a chance?      Looking forward to the advice.      Thanks   Nikhil",

Also, the debt if any would be barred by a period of limitation. The offence of dishonour of cheque is made out only if the cheque had been issued for the discharge of any debt or other liability. In this regard, it may be noted that in the case of Vijay v. Laxman, (2013) 3 SCC 86, the Supreme Court upheld the acquittal of the accused in a cheque dishonour case on the ground that the accused, who was supplier of milk, was given the price of the milk in advance as per the trade practice, in acknowledgment and by way of security for which amount the accused had issued the cheque in question. Likewise, in the case of Sudhir Kumar Bhalla v. Jagdish Chand, (2008) 7 SCC 137, the Supreme Court set aside the order of the High Court, inter alia, on the ground that the High Court had not addressed the legal question that the criminal liability of the accused under the provisions of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is attracted only on account of the dishonour of the cheques issued in discharge of liability or debt, but not on account of issuance of security cheques. In this case, the Supreme Court remitted the case back to the High Court for reconsideration. The directors would have to seek bail from court as well and exemption application for permanent exemption of the senior citizen lady director can be filed in the court where the present cases at being tried. There is no set formula for deciding the bail amount and it is totally upon the descretion of the magistrate trying your cases."

If she did not have any role in the day to day functioning of the company then she can seek the quashing of case by filing a petition in the High Court. Alternatively, she can contest the matter in the trial court. 3. Exemption from personal appearance has to be sought from the trial court in the first place, and if it is denied then the matter can be carried to the High Court. 4. Your lawyer is right. 5. Even a security cheque on being dishonoured makes the accused liable under Section 138 of NI Act. Under Section 138 NI Act there is a presumption that cheque in question was issued to discharge a legally enforceable debt, and the onus is stacked on the accused to rebut this presumption. It is a provision loaded heavily against the accused. So unless there is some plausible and cogent defence, conviction is bound to happen on trial."

The complainant has to specifically implead and plead how an accused was involved in the functioning of the company. The law has been settled by SC  in various judgments.  The bail amount is at discretion of court and in your case the Court may aske security of i L each accused. The bail amount is not to be paid in cash. You can furnish a security by way of property documents etc.  As far as defence is concerned, there is no straight jacket formula. The law is that security cheques are not given against liability but if you owe some money to suppliers then he can utilise the cheques  against that liability.  In my practice we have got acquitted accused who actually issued cheques against the liability because there were technical errors in the complaints. So defence depends upon close scrutiny of complaint, cross examination of accused etc."

So technically, the court can ask the drawer to pay up to Rs18 Lakhs(20/100*90Lakhs) as interim compensation.   5) The director who had signed the cheque alone has to apply for bail. The other director should file for quashing of case under 482 of Cr.P.C instead of applying for bail.  Hope this information is useful."

        "query-text": "I will try to be as detailed and honest as possible. I started a partnership firm (not registered) five years ago on December 30, 2010 with a long-time friend of mine (I will call him Mr. A) since he helped me before starting the business financially with few sums which I had paid back before this venture began. I introduced him in to the firm without any capital. The firm was a small investment management company wherein friends and relatives would deposit some capital and they would get a fixed or floating rate of return over time. The business was Share trading. In the beginning it was all fine I had a small bunch of people whose money I would manage and everything went smoothly. However, as the time went by more people started depositing money with me. With the capital base increasing I started diversification and expansion. Meanwhile one more long-time friend of mine (I will call him Mr. B) joined the firm though not as a partner. Mr. A and Mr. B would introduce new clients and they would get commissions plus salaries. In the mid of 2012 Mr. A introduced one client (I will call him Mr. C) who wanted a bit extra percentage in return on his investment. Mr. A induced me to put that extra percentage and I accepted it. That worked out to be 9% a month! However, no formal agreement was made. And his investments came in the form of cash. Not very heavy investments though. Henceforth this went on for about 18 months or so. Mr. B also brought in people (largely uneducated women and few men among his relatives). As the other business grew demand for capital increased. People made my firm a money making machine and I started coming under huge stress. On many occasions I was forced to make huge principal payments within months of investments that too with a profit. Payments started getting delayed and to manage eventually became almost impossible. I have to be honest in saying that after a point when call for principal repayments started my firm transformed into a Ponzi. The beginning of 2014 was horrible as the pressure mounted so much so that I was threatened of illegal and legal consequences. I shall put what happened next as \u201cevents\u201d in a list form:   1.\tOne of the client came visited my office during May 2014, badly abused and threatened me. His wife had put some 20 lacs in a period of 1 year and withdrew 15 lacs during that time breaching all the terms and conditions of the agreement. He wanted the rest 5 lacs immediately which I could never be able to pay.   2.\tOne June 08, 2014 a bunch of clients visited my office in my absence created a scene there, damaged office property and took my computer along. I kept on begging them over the phone not to harm my business area as I was in talks of finalizing a deal.    3.\tI tried the next day the same thing but they refused to return my computer, abused me and threatened me.    4.\tAfter trying everything and losing all hope on June 09, 2014 I left my home and went absconding. I was very scared and hopeless.    5.\tThen after my parents filed NC with the local police station against the people who took away my laptop and they returned it back. But the harassment continued towards my family and later.   6.\tIt\u2019s been more than 2 years now and Mr. A informed my parents that he was arrested because Mr. C took him and they underwent a settlement (He may be lying). Now that Mr. A had to settle Mr. C, Mr. A is demanding my presence and money back. Although huge sums of money has been already paid by me.       I want an expert to throw some light on this with all their experience:      What are the legal consequences on me now that more than 2 years have been passed?      What if they do something illegal with me?      What legal help do I have at my disposal?      I want to be able to conduct business properly but I cannot be absconding all the time.",

Laws Related to NRI Divorce A growing trend among Indian men and women can be seen to get married to NRIs. According to the recent statistical data, 225 women from metro cities get married to NRIs every year and out of these around 25 want to end their marriage due to reasons of hiding facts or of deception. This is the reason why it is important for Indians who marry NRIs to have knowledge of laws related to NRI divorce. Many of NRI weddings end in divorce due to the reasons like:  The NRI spouses inflate their assets like home, high paid job, or vehicle in the foreign country but actually might not be in a position to support a family after marriage. The NRI spouse happens to have another spouse, settled with him abroad. The NRI spouse feels that Indian spouse is not a suitable partner in coping up with him and his advanced lifestyle and hence, seeks divorce on the grounds of incompatibility.  However, The Process Needs one to Furnish the Following Information for Completion of Divorce Process:  Where was one married? India or Abroad Does one have children? Will both be able to reach a financial settlement of their possessions? What is the religion of both the partners? Which country is one based in? What is his or her nationality?  Even though, there are not many laws to protect the interest of Indians who marry NRIs but due to rise in the number of troubled marriages of NRIs with Indians, the government is introducing NGOs in both India as well as abroad and these shall guide Indian men and women who are married to NRIs and settled abroad. They offer emotional support, counseling, and legal advice in the process of divorce and separation. Another thing to be kept in mind is that even if the divorce is taking place abroad, it would be good to appoint an attorney who is proficient in Indian divorce laws related to NRIs. The Basic Laws Related to NRI Divorce, That One Must be Well Aware of are:  If both the spouses are settled in USA, or any other foreign country, then they can seek divorce by mutual consent under the foreign marriages divorce laws of that country. If both the spouses are Indians and have been married under Hindu marriage Act 1955, in that case they can seek divorce with mutual consent under section 13-B."

This association is registered under Karnataka Societies Registration Act 1960 for the purpose as mentioned in the Memorandum of Association, this registration part was not notified to all house owners, with some handful of people they framed Bye-Laws and registered it. We came to know about this association after formation and creation of Whatsapp group. Till date even after asking multiple times not all house holders have copy of MOA, AOA or Bye-laws. Neither they disclose who are office bearers and authorized signatories, neither would have renewed the association as it has to be done every year. Resulting they dont have proper audit report. When questioned on misrepresentation and misconduct all of them started to do mob attacks in Whatsapp Group on which house owners like us who never resided in the flat are afraid to enter even premises due to physical attacks.       We have no clue on maintenance part being mentioned in MOA or Byelaws. By default they collect close to 1000 Rupees per month. Now since my flat is vacant I asked for Bifurcation of the amount payable they have mentioned water charges since my house is vacant for so many years am I liable to pay these charges?       Upon asking this queries people belonging to association started to threaten and passed work order for disconnection of water supply and electric supply. We dont water for 24 hours which was mentioned in sale agreement by builder on top of that even after disconnection they ask us to pay maintenance charges. Not just limiting to disconnection there is harassment, threatening, extortion, humiliation and defamation of house owners in the whatsapp group.

For separation from your husband you can file petition under section 12 of Hindu Marriage Act ,this is for annulment of marriage(means declaring the marriage null n void) . Annulment and divorce are two different things. Annulment is cancellation of marriage.(status becomes single again) Divorce is legal separation. (Status becomes divorcee). Thank You"

To add to this, it can also be a long-winded and costly affair in India if the divorce is contested. Even couples that mutually agree to the divorce, however, must prove that they have been separated for a year before the courts consider their plea. Only in exceptional circumstances can you file for divorce before expiry of one year of marriage. Best option is to file for divorce by mutual consent. Mutual divorce may take anything from a minimum of three hearings or 6 months to one year (Divorce with Mutual consent, where in a joint petition is filed by both husband and wife) to as long as 2 -10 years also or more. But you have to stay separate for period of one year before filing for divorce by mutual consent.  Under Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, the parties can seek divorce by mutual consent by filing a petition before the court. Mutual consent means that both the parties agree for peaceful separation. Spouses should talk to each other about future course. If both spouses reach to a conclusion that marriage is not workable they should ease out the tension surrounding them and accept that their marriage has broken down. Forget the fear of society. Nobody knows situation better than husband and wife themselves; also impact on the children. Also, you can talk to your parents calmly and cooling. Tell them about the problems you are facing. I am sure they will understand. Decide who you want to talk to.  Pick a good time and place to talk.  Think about what you need.  Think of what you'll say.  Explain your situation. Give details that can help parents understand your situation. Explain what you think, feel, and want. Be honest. If you're always honest, a parent will be likely to believe what you say. If you sometimes hide the truth or add too much drama, parents will have a harder time believing what you tell them. If you lie, they'll find it hard to trust you. Try to understand their side. Telling parents you understand their side helps them be willing to see yours, too. Try not to argue or whine. Use a tone that's friendly and respectful. That makes it more likely parents will listen and take what you say seriously. It also makes it more likely that they'll talk to you in the same way.

                "response-text": "Zero liability of a customer If the fraud happens due to negligence from the bank's end, the customer obviously is not liable. For instance, if there is a glitch on the backend of the bank where customer details are compromised, then you will not be liable to pay. Or if bank employees are involved in fraudulent activities where they give away customer details.  The RBI notification states that if a 'third-party' breach happens when neither the bank nor the customer is at fault, and the customer informs the bank within three working days, here, too, the customer is not liable to pay. Who is a third-party you may ask. Well, scammers and fraudsters are getting more creative by the day. It can happen at an ATM (skimming, card trapping etc.), by using public Wi-Fi, malware in ATMs or bank servers, at merchant outlets where you swipe your credit or debit card, or even on your own computer (using ways like pharming and so on). So, to protect yourself and your money, the first step is make sure you apply for the SMS and email alerts service of your bank. The second step would be to intimate the bank as soon as you get the alert that money has been debited from your account. Do it within three days. If you do not, then depending on how long you take, your liability increases. Limited liability of a customer Now if the bank is at fault, you do not pay, but if the fraud or wrongful debit has happened because of your negligence, then you will have to bear the brunt. This could happen if you mentioned your PIN number or password in passing or left it lying around and someone used it without your knowledge. The good news is that even though this transaction has happened due to your negligence, if you report it to the bank before seven working days (and after three days) from receiving the debit message, the RBI notification says that the per transaction liability of the customer will be limited to the transaction value or an amount set by the central bank, whichever is lower. And if you take more than seven days, \"the customer liability shall be determined as per the bank's Board approved policy,\" says the RBI notification. How long will it take for the reversal? Banks have to credit or reverse the unauthorised electronic transaction to the customer's account within 10 working days from the date of notification by the customer. And once reported, in case of debit card or bank account fraud, the bank should ensure that the customer does not suffer loss of interest. If the transaction has happened on a credit card, the customer should not have to additional burden of interest. Also, once reported, banks have to resolve the case within 90 days from the date of receipt of the complaint. Systems to be put in place by banks RBI's circular has said that banks must provide customers 24/7 access through multiple channels like SMS, email, IVR and so on for reporting unauthorised transactions. A new facility that banks have been asked to provide is that of allowing customers to \"instantly respond by \"Reply\" to the SMS and e-mail alerts and the customers should not be required to search for a web page or an e-mail address to notify the objection\"."

                "response-text": "There are two ways to legally end a marriage \u2013 annulment and divorce. Annulment is a legal procedure for declaring a marriage null and void. A marriage can be declared null and void if certain legal requirements were not met at the time of the marriage. If these legal requirements were not met then the marriage is considered to have never existed in the eyes of the law. This process is called annulment. The marriage has not been consummated ( no sexual relationship has occurred between the husband and wife) is one of the ground for annulment. Please do understand that your wife is staying away from you is not a ground for filing an annulment. The marriage implies an implicit right to conjugality or consortium or Sexual intercourse. Right of consortium implies the corresponding duty of each spouse to cohabit with the other. The mutual right to several intercourse continues throughout the entire period of marital life. However, if the very foundation of marriage, namely, the mutual right of consortium is absent, the very purpose of marriage is defeated. In such eventuality, Law prescribes (a) Divorce or (b) Decree of Nullity depending upon several factors. But whether it is Divorce or Decree of Nullity, result is same; marriage stands dissolved and conjugality or consortium or sexual intercourse becomes unlawful as parties remain no more husband and wife. A person may be disabled mentally or physically for some other activity of life will not mean the person is disabled for sexual activity. Section 30 prescribes Decree of Nullity if marriage is not consummated because of natural causes or impotency.Section 32(a) prescribes Divorce for willful refusal to consummate the marriage. In Section 30 and Section 32(a) 'Non-Consummation of Marriage' is really the Ground and 'Separate Living' or 'Not-Living-Together' is only incidental. But in Section 32(h) and Section 32-A, the 'Not-Living-Together' or 'Separate Living' is really the ground and non- consummation is only incidental. A wife is not entitled to any allowance if she, without sufficient cause, refuses to live with her husband. Marriage throws an obligation on the wife, to live and co-habit with her husband. Only on reasonable grounds she is justified to live separate from him. Neglect, cruelty, ill treatment, impotency, extra-marital relationship, remarriage are sufficient grounds to justly separate living by a wife. The courts also have to take note of the fact that the amount of maintenance fixed for the wife should be such as she can live in reasonable comfort considering her status and mode of life she was used to live when she lived with her husband. At the same time, the amount so fixed cannot be excessive or affect the living condition of the other party. These are all the broad principles courts have to be kept in mind while determining maintenance or permanent alimony. Looking at the burden on the husband to provide maintenance to his wife even in cases where the wife is well educated and capable enough to earn for her living, a bench of S.A. Morey J gave a landmark judgment in favour of husband to curb the misuse of the provision of maintenance, and held that a wife who is well qualified and is capable to earn cannot sit idle and claim maintenance from her husband. The Court relied on Mamta Jaiswal v. Rajesh Jaiswal where it was held that \u201cwell-qualified wife is not entitled to remain as an idle and claim maintenance from her husband\u201d. Immediately send a legal notice to your wife and ask her to join you in marital life. If she does not join with you then file for Annulment of Marriage."

For this section to apply there are certain requirements which have to be met and fulfilled by both the parties to the divorce which can be stated as follows:  The parties have been living separately for a period of at least one year They have not been able to live together, and They have mutually agreed that marriage should be resolved   The Supreme Court in 2012 ruled that the waiting period of six months can be waived off and a Marriage Laws Amendment Bill, 2010 was proposed which replaces the words \"not earlier than six months\" in Section 13-B with the words \"Upon receipt of a petition.\" However the bill has not been yet passed by Lok Sabha as there was strong opposition to the bill and is still under a conflict. We can conclude that prior to this Act; there was no provision for Divorce as this concept was too radical as the marriage was considered as a sacred and divine bond. In earlier marriages wives were the victims and were always at the mercy of their husbands and in- laws family and had no source to raise their voice and revolt. But we can notice that there are pros and cons of every law. So the lawmakers of our country have a hard role to perform to see the future implications and act in a cautious manner."

        "query-text": "Hi,   I have sold my flat recently.My property broker, who is also the broker for the buyer party of my flat, has sent me a legal notice for not paying the commission as discussed.   I was not happy about broker being the lazy one in handling the communication among all and not being cooperative for me. I was overseas during the deal and it created lot of confusion and stress for me as a seller to manage the things from long distance and found no use of having a broker from my side.   There is no written agreement between me and broker, only 1-2 times on whatsapp it has been told.   I have paid partial amount to him and told he deserved that much only.   Now he has sent me a legal notice ( by email and by courier) mentioning that I owe him the pending amount and IPC 420 will be applicable to the case he will file against me and my spouse ( we are joint seller) .   I am not in India and i haven't replied to the notice yet.   I need to understand few things about this case :-      1- If there is no written commitment about the brokerage services and payment, still one can file a case for the same ?   2- Whatsapp messages play any role as evidence ?   3- What if i have not replied to the notice yet?    4- How strong the case is against me?      Looking forward to get a good help for understanding the legal prospective of this case to proceed further with this.      Thanks",

Because there was no dishonest of fraudulent intention from your part at the beginning  to cheat him. According to the judgement given by the Supreme Court of India in Ramjas versus state of UP it is clear that failure of promise at the later stage cannot form basis for the initiation of proceeding for the offence of cheating punishable under section 420 of the Indian Penal Code. You should not be worry that he can initiate criminal proceeding against you on this fact and roped your wife also in that preceding. If he files FIR or complaint against you on this fact for the office of cheating you have to move and application before the high court under section 482 of the code of criminal procedure and for quashing of this criminal proceeding. You have proper remedy to defend yourself against any false criminal case filed against you. Yes WhatsApp messages may be used as evidence but the person wants to use these messages as evidence have to follow the procedure laid down under section 65b of the Indian Evidence Act. He has to produce his mobile phone printout of the messages along with a certificate that messages has been exchanged through the proper media and it has not been manipulated.  If giving threats to initiate criminal proceeding against you through this notice you have to ignore it or you may  file a complaint on the basis of this notice for the offence of criminal intimidation punishable under section 504/506 of the Indian Penal Code. The broker wants to file FIR against you on the basis of these facts he will not be able to sustain his case and it may be  quashed by the high court under section 482 of the CRPC. This is very weak case because there is no ingredients of the offence of cheating."

        "query-text": "I run one NGO.  In the year 2007 a married lady joined me as my Assistant in this NGO Office. Initially it was usual official relationship but after 6 months, she started seducing me.  She became very possessive to such an extent that even if my wife talks to me she will not like it.  She was very good at work and I was ignoring initially the passes but later on I also fell for her and we both got illegally married at a temple outside the city and only we two were aware of that marriage and no one in the society knew about it.  The relationship carried on for some years until my legally wedded wife came to know.        My wife took corrective action in ensuring she moves away from me and I cooperated with my wife and that lady also cooperated to stay away.  Since knowingly or unknowingly we got into extra marital affairs, I invested on opening a new NGO in her name and I invested all the money, where she and her husband are the Trustees and I took no role in the NGO other than helping them financially from outside as a well-wisher to their family.   I set up an office for them by paying advance, invested on office furniture and also financially supported them for some time.  The idea of opening this office for her was to give her a livelihood throughout her life and it was done with a good intention.        This happened in Jan 2016 and without the knowledge of my wife.   Again, my wife came to know about this after some months and again she ensured that we both talk to each other and disconnect our association.  That lady was not willing but this time, I was stubborn in my decision and I said 'no more such connection' and did not yield to her pressure.   I decided to disconnect with her permanently this time and since I have given her livelihood, I did not feel the guilt of disconnecting.       When she came to know I am very stubborn this time, she has started creating problems for me.  She has started demanding money and she is likely to demand a big ransom from me and I am anticipating more trouble.       All my office documents are with her in that office and she is now not cooperating to give all that.  She is also threatening me that all my present donors will be informed about the dis-association of my NGO and her NGO.  If she does this, it will affect our NGO's credibility and since she knows this, she is now black mailing me that if I don't accede to her demands, she will spoil the NGO's image in this manner.  In the bargain, her NGO image will also go and something tells me she will not jeopardise her NGO image also in this.       I would like to take legal help and lock her office since I was the one who has paid the advance for the premises and through my financial support only she was able to run the NGO.  Once I take back all the documents related to my office, I will not have any problems since she will not have data to do any damage for my NGO.  I will let her run her NGO independently thereafter.       Our illegal relationship is not known to her husband or her family or her relatives but I know some of them. I also have a point to threaten her.  But I would rather proceed taking legal steps in protecting myself and my office documents rather than yielding to that kind of tactics.        I am not justifying my actions but having realized that I made a mistake, I am trying to correct myself but she is blackmailing me and not allowing me to lead a peaceful life.       I need expert advise from you all how to tackle this issue tactfully.  Is there any legal remedy for this.",

Intial days there was no issue but at 4th year onwards she started troubling others employees & fraud related works, we warned her multiple times and also took 2 times written appolize letters in span of one year. But even after all this she committed serious issue at office & we asked her to leave job. considering her family instead of termination we given her up to date settlement along with one month additional salary in mode of cheque. & she uncashed it within two hours. ( 1.2.2018 ) The shocking thing after 2 days ( 3.2.2018 ) she given complaint at KS Layout police station stating we threatened her and forcefully asked her to leave job, the sub inspector asked me to come station and i given all her apolize letter & settlement and resignation documents. Sub inspector felt its her mistake with warning on both side she closed the case on same day. Then everything was going good all of sudden i got call after 6 month ( 1.8.2018 ) stating there is FIR on me with a section 323, 506, 509 & 354 IPC . I visited the station again and checked it was another new complaint from the same lady after 1 week from the first complaint. In her Second & New complaint she stated after the First complaint issue resolved i called her out side of police station ( 500 meter distance ) and started talk with her on bad words & tried to hold her neck and pushed her down, also as per complaint there was her brother who helped to involve and releave both of us from fighting.       Unfortunately after the i came to know about 2nd complaint i given all the documents ( her apolize letter, settlement & first complaint detail ) but still police nothing considered and they just raised charge sheet stating i have committed the crime & on top of it they suggested at station level cant do anything u can fight at court. now the case is in honorable court. Its a just case for Police but it affected me very badly - I even forced to leave my job even though i have not committed any crime .       My query is - after first complaint i came out of police station and left from there immediately but the second complaint is raised after week and i came to know to after 6 month so i could not able get any solid proof that i was not in that place & NOT COMMITTED ANY CRIME. even her side the only one proof is her brother ( of course he is false proof - eye witness ) & No any medical report of wound or anything.       1. If Honorable Court decide i am guilty what might be least & max punishment that i may get ?    2. Even though she was just near station (500 meter) she given complaint after week will it affect her & Case ?    3. Here police worked complaint against me - are this section whatever they have mentioned are this correct for the crime explained ?    4. Police informed me after 6 month about complaint was not mistake ?       Thank you for your valuable advice",

Scheduled Delivery was June2015.      Builder not able to sell all flats and perhaps diversion of funds, so our project progress was too slow. Frame structure of 14floor was done in 3years and thus we had to pay 90% of the amount in Construction linked purchase plan. After that till now (2020), progress is slow in 3BHK but he delivered other towers of 2BHK (few of them got registered, few are just possession no registry).      In 2016 timeframe, builder financed 30+ crore from AnandRathi global finance and he put his 3 plots and this project as security for the loan . Builder has shown around 96 flats as UNSOLD (even though they are actually sold before 2016 itself like mine in 2013 with AoS in 2013). We also paid last instalment in 2017 in Anand Rathi Escrow account as the project was financed by that time.      Now builder is not able to pay money back to AnandRathi and thus AnandRathi has given advertizement not to deal with builder under SAFARESI Act. Anand Rathi has also posted a notice in front of my flat (under construction project) which is shown as mortgaged to Anand Rathi   There is case going between builder and AnandRathi in DRT but we don't know whats the issue in that.      I already send mail to AnandRathi person in notice in my flat that this flat is purchased by me in 2013 but he says talk to builder as he gave them unsold list. When i did AoS in 2013, AnandRathi was not in picture at all as project got financed in 2016. I had taken SBI loan to finance flat but loan is now closed in 2019      As a flat buyer who purchased in 2013,   - what should be done so that AnandRathi can't get a hold on my flat if they win the case in DRT with the builder as my flat is unsold it appears to AnandRathi.   - What should we do to make the builder deliver the project?

The principle embodying the said doctrine is that the subject matter of a suit should not be transferred to a third party during the pendency of the suit. In case of transfer of such immovable property, the transferee(new buyer) becomes bound by the result of the suit. 5) Lis Pendens is captured under Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (the \u201cAct\u201d). The Section essentially prohibits alienation of immovable property when a dispute relating to the same is pending in a competent court of law.   Hope this information is useful."

                "response-text": "Dear Sir, The jurisdiction of filing cheque dishonour cases under Section 138 of the N.I. Act is now changed by the above Ordinance as under:  Now a cheque bouncing case can be filed only in the court at the place where the bank in which the payee has account is located. For example, if you are based at Delhi and you have an account in a bank in a particular area of Delhi. You receive a cheque from someone in Mumbai. You present your cheque in Delhi in the bank where you have your account. Now, if this cheque is dishonoured, then the cheque bounce case can be filed only in Delhi in the court which has jurisdiction over the area where your bank is located. Secondly, once you have filed a cheque bounce case in one particular court at a place in this manner, subsequently if there is any other cheque of the same party (drawer) which has also bounced, then all such subsequent cheque bounce cases against the same drawer will also have to filed in the same court (even if you present them in some bank in some other city or area). This will ensure that the drawer of cheques is not harassed by filing multiple cheque bounce cases at different locations. So, even multiple cheque bounce cases against the same party can be filed only in one court even if you present the cheques in different banks at different locations. Thirdly, all cheque bounce cases which are pending as on 15 June 2015 in different courts in India, will be transferred to the court which has jurisdiction to try such case in the manner mentioned above, i.e., such pending cases will be transferred to the court which has jurisdiction over the place where the bank of the payee is located. If there are multiple cheque bounce cases pending between the same parties as on 15 June 2015, then all such multiple cases will be transferred to the court where the first case has jurisdiction as per above principle."

Soon after engagement in June his parents started demanding hotel rooms/ furniture / cash from my parents and never contributed a single penny in marriage or engagement . My parents had to bear both party expenses themselves . After subsequent demands I denied marrying to him . But he emotionally dragged me to marriage . After marriage his parents came to our flat where we stayed in allahabad . His mother demanded my salary every month . But I told her that I am saving that money for future . During emergency I ll give u all the money . But please dont ask me to withdraw it . Which led to bitterness in her .She even started sleeping between me and my husband on bed . In March they denied giving me jewellery to wear on holi which my parents gave in marriage . When I went home without jewellery my parents gifted me a new set which took 20 days for them . So I stayed at my mothers place . My husband called up my father on phone and asked him stupid questions about my character and asked him to immediately send your daughter . My parents were shattered by this act . In September both our parents went to shirdi on my father expense but there also husband's mother created a scene and all 3 (husband, mother and father in law ) abused me in front of my father . Which resulted into parents argument . I came to my parents house but my husband apologize and took me back home on karwa chauth 17 october . We stayed happy for 1 month after which suddenly my husband stopped physical intimacy with me , stopped taking me to relatives marriage , I kept asking him reason for this acts but he gave excuses everytime. I asked him that we should have a baby which may result into conflict ending between our parents . But he denied . And after 3 months on 21st feb husband was in lucknow when I was trying to contact him and crying bitterly . And he had no fear as he knew I won't speak a word regarding baby matter and no intimacy to anyone . I msgd him on what's app that I want a baby frm u .He blocked me . Then on fb status I made the custom settings visibility only for my husband and I wrote there for help regarding ivf as my husband is having medical problem . I thought my husband would read this and in fear he will come to me and talk regarding this matter . But the reverse happened . He got a reason to elope and since 3 months I m asking him again and again to come back . But he is putting false allegations on me that I beat and torture him. Yesterday he said that my 2 conditions to come back are 1- you write on stamp paper that if anything happens to me my husband is not responsible and I won't file any domestic violence case in marriage .2- not insisting to have baby for 3 years at least . Please help me what should I do. I have written to national women commission and 1090 but no results .",

In 2012, subsequent to my marriage with my wife, she had obtained complete legal custody of both children (10 & 11 yrs resp.) With full consent of her ex-husband in a family court. Her ex-husband has also remarried someone subsequently.   For the past 3 years the children have been living under my care and I have been supporting their school, living and shelter. Now I wish to adopt them as my own children. Given this situation, with my wife having full custody of the children, is it sufficient if my wife (natural mother) executes the deed of adoption to me? Or do I have to approach the natural father for consent (which I want to avoid unless unavoidable).      Thanks in advance for your help and advice.",

Petitioner  Through: Mr. M. Dutta, Advocate  versus  UNION OF INDIA ..... Respondent  Through: Mr. Ruchir Mishra, Advocate  CORAM:  HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE VIPIN SANGHI  JUDGMENT It is not even the petitioner's case that Shri Abhijit Ghosh has, in that wider and natural sense, renounced the world. All that the petitioner contends is that Shri Abhijit Ghosh, her natural father, has not no concern with the petitioner any longer. Had the intention of the legislature been to exclude the consent of that parent, who may have cut off all his relationship with the minor child, on account of the divorce obtained by the parents, the legislature would not have used the expression \"renounce the world\" but would have used the words like \"severed his or her relationship with the minor child\" instead. It is not for this Court to read into the plain language used by the legislature, words which are not there. the petitioner's mother could not have secured the right, at the time of her obtaining divorce from Shri Abhijit Ghosh, to claim that the petitioner was not the naturally born child of her natural father, Shri Abhijit Ghosh. The petitioner's mother also could not have taken away the petitioner's right to claim that Shri Abhijit Ghosh is her natural father. The petitioner's right to claim her status as the daughter and an heir of Shri Abhijit Ghosh also could not have been taken away by her mother by entering into a compromise with her natural father. The rights which inhere in the petitioner on account of her being a natural heir of her natural father continue to survive. The identity of the petitioner is derived by the fact that the petitioner is the naturally born child of her parents i.e. Shri Abhijit Ghosh and Smt. Rajeshwari Ghosh, now known as Smt. Rajeshwari Chattoraj. The settlement arrived at between the petitioner's parents at the time when they obtained the divorce cannot be said to include an implied consent by the petitioner's father to the giving in adoption of the petitioner to any other person. Sections 5 and 6 of the HAMA. These provisions read as follows:- \"5. Adoptions to be regulated by this Chapter- (1) No adoption shall be made after the commencement of this Act by or to a Hindu except in accordance with the provisions contained in this Chapter, and any adoption made in contravention of the said provisions shall be void. (2) An adoption which is void shall neither create any rights in the adoptive family in favour of any person which he or she could not have acquired except by reason of the adoption, nor destroy the rights of any person in the family of his or her birth. 6. Requisites of a valid adoption.- No adoption shall be valid unless- (i) the person adopting has the capacity, and also the right, to take in adoption; (ii) the person giving in adoption has the capacity to do so; (iii) the person adopted is capable of being taken in adoption; and (iv) the adoption is made in compliance with the other conditions mentioned in this Chapter.\" 37. It is pertinent to note that both Sections 5 and 6 of the HAMA begin with the words \"no adoption shall be made........\" and \"no adoption shall be valid unless.........\" It is, therefore, clear that both these provisions are mandatory. From a reading of Section 5, it is clear that an adoption not made in accordance with the provisions of Chapter II of the HAMA is void. The adoption is not valid unless the person giving in adoption has the capacity to do so and the adoption is made in compliance with the conditions mentioned in Chapter II of the HAMA, which would include the condition mentioned in the proviso to Section 9(2) of the said Act. 38. For all the aforesaid reasons, I dismiss this petition leaving it open to the petitioner to comply with the objections raised by the RPO and to resubmit her application with the correct details, inter alia, with regard to her parentage. The parties are left to bear their respective costs. (VIPIN SANGHI) JUDGE MARCH 30, 2012"

The rules laid down in this section are rules of substantive law and not merely of procedure. The fact that the foreign judgment may fail to show that every separate issue, such as, the status of the contracting parties, or the measure of damages, was separately framed and decided, is irrelevant unless it can be shown that failure brings the case within the purview of one of the exceptions to Section 13. The judgment of a foreign Court creates estoppel or res judicata between the same parties, provided such judgment is not subject to attack under any of the clauses (a) to (f) of Section 13 of the Code. If any claim is made by any party and subsequently abandoned at the trial of a suit and if the decree in that suit necessarily implies that claim has not met with acceptance at the hands of the court, then the court must be deemed to have directly adjudicated against it."

Under the Indian law there are two ways of getting a foreign judgement enforced. Firstly by filing an Execution Petition under Section 44A of the CPC (in case the conditions specified therein are fulfilled). Secondly by filing a suit upon the foreign judgement/decree.  Under S. 44A of the CPC, a decree of any of the Superior Courts of any reciprocating territory are executable as a decree passed by the domestic Court. Therefore in case the decree does not pertain to a reciprocating territory or a superior Court of a reciprocating territory , as notified by the Central Government in the Official Gazette, the decree is not directly executable in India. In case the decree pertains to a country which is not a reciprocating territory then a fresh suit will have to be filed in India on the basis of such a decree or judgement, which may be construed as a cause of action for the said suit. In the fresh suit, the said decree will be treated as another piece of evidence against the defendant .  However in both cases the decree has to pass the test of S. 13 CPC which specifies certain exceptions under which the foreign judgement becomes inconclusive and is therefore not executable or enforceable in India."

Reciprocating territories are those countries decrees of whose superior courts can be enforced under section 44A of CPC as if they were decrees passed by an Indian district court. Section 13 of the CPC lays down as to when foreign court orders can\u2019t be held to be conclusive\u2014for instance, if they are passed by a court without proper jurisdiction over the matter.  Coming to your criminal case now. All said, if there is something in the foreign decree you believe is likely to help you in the criminal case, you can present the U.S. court divorce order before the criminal court. Or you can even use it in a petition for discharge or quashing under Section 482 ( if any) to support your case. If it is contended by the other side that the court should not place reliance on the foreign judgement as the court in the U.S. did not have jurisdiction to grant such divorce, you can counter by arguing that the wife voluntarily subjected herself to that court\u2019s jurisdiction and gladly accepted the money awarded there. (Note: CrPC itself does not have any provision analogous to ss. 44A and 13 CPC.) I hope you have your answer. Follow-up queries welcome in case you need any clarification!"

We are building a house for which I have taken a loan of Rs. 99.2L. The Market value of the plot is about Rs. 1.5Cr and after construction, the expected value will be Rs. 2.5Cr.    The loan is being repaid only by me and over the course of 29 years, expected sum to be paid back, including interest is Rs. 2.69Cr.    Originally, the plot was in the name of my father and mother in equal parts. My father transferred his 50% share of the property to me and my brother in equal parts when he had trouble getting a loan in his name. Now the ownership structure is 25% me, 25% brother, 50% mother.   I have an oral agreement with my mother that upon her death, her complete share shall be transferred to me. I wish to have this legally documented as well, so that there are no disputes down the line.      Secondly, I wish to have an agreement in place that my brother will have to transfer his 25% to me (or my next of kin), and he cannot sell his share to anyone else. How can this agreement be created and registered with the registrar to ensure this sale doesn't happen?      I was earlier okay with having 75% ownership, but the loan amount has gone up from 75L to 1Cr, and my brother instead of even thinking of helping, has started regularly fighting and raising hell in the house. 1 year ago, during transfer, he insisted that he doesn't want any share, but was overruled by my father. Today, I feel that ideally, he has no right to the property if he is not contributing to the family, and I have to bear all expenses from Loans, Electricity to even milk. I want to avoid a bigger dispute later and settle this now, when I. can still stop construction and sell the property altogether and be free of the headaches.",

As well as asked an alimony of 1 crore for divorce which was straight away denied by me. Later in Oct 2018 she n her father filed FIR at the same police station under section 498a n 406 ipc. In this FIR she had added a medical report of her teeth being broken which she never said or wrote before in any of her previous complaints to police and in my organization. Again I was called by the police during that time whatever cloths or items were left of her at my home, we have returned in the police station but still she n her father are writing letters to commissioner of police stating I have not given her full streedhan back and she did not took any jewellery from my home and its still with us (a straight lie).In the police investigation it was found that the medical report of teeth broken was of just few months back I.e may be of jul or Aug 2018 and me n my wife are not in any kind of contact from Dec 2017. Police found the FIR false and submitted the FR to court on 19 Feb 2019. On 20 Feb 2019 family court gave maintenance order of rupees 10 thousand per month on my petition of RCR, the very same day I withdrew my petition of RCR and filed for divorce on 11 Apr 2019. For which the next date is 25 Jul 2019. In the meanwhile she had filed a protest petition against FR in which she n her father had recorded their statements in court on 18 Apr 2019 as well as filed another petition under domestic violence law of 2005. For both of these the next court date is 13 May 2019. Her fathers image is very bad in their village, its arrogant, selfish, greedy, egoistic etc etc which is being told by various no of her relatives including her own n only younger uncle to us. So here below are my main points. 1. False medical report. 2. False 498a on me. 3. Taking away our gold worth 8 lakhs. 4. Defamatory letters in my organization. 5. I have call recordings of her, her father, her elder sister and her elder sister's threats of defaming me more, fiing false 498a, getting us arrested, not letting my two younger sister to get married, spoiling mine n my father's job. 6. She always manipulates her statement. So sir/ma'am please help me out in filing a counter case n how should I draft.",

If he proposes to drive any other vehicle than the one for which he/she possesses any effective driving licence he is to seek an addition to his/her driving licence. In other words, if a person wants to drive only a motor car whose unladen weight does not exceeds 7500 kgs., he needs to have a licence to drive a light motor vehicle only. At the same time, if a person wants to drive a motor car for hire and reward then that light motor vehicle will become a public service vehicle as well and a holder would not be competent to drive the motor car for hire and reward, that is, a maxicab or a motorcab or a taxi unless he possesses a licence to drive a transport vehicle for LMV. Similarly, every goods carriage is included in the definition of transport vehicle. Thus, the holder of a licence must possess a licence to drive a transport vehicle of the category of the goods vehicle whose gross vehicle weight does not exceed 7500 kgs., then he must possess a licence to drive a light motor vehicle of the category of transport vehicle. If he wants to drive a goods vehicle whose gross vehicle weight is above 7500 kgs. or 12,000 kgs., then he must possess a licence to drive a medium motor vehicle of the category of transport vehicle and heavy motor vehicle of the category of transport vehicle respectively. At the same time, a person possessing a licence to drive a heavy motor vehicle would be competent to drive a medium motor vehicle and light motor vehicle of the category of transport vehicle."

Further the transport vehicle covers the public service vehicles/goods vehicles also as per sec 2 (47) of MV Act 1988. SO one can easily draw instant interference that the LMV covers all the above stated vehicles may it be used for commercial or private purpose. However the position is different.

DEFENSES FOR HUSBAND TO DENY OR REDUCE MAINTENANCE   If your wife has asked for maintenance under CrPC 125, here's your chance to learn everything about how to fight and deny or reduce maintenance under CrPC 125 1. Husband\u2019s EMI towards house to be considered in CrPC 125 Maintenance to wife \u2013 SC Judgment The order reduced maintenance amount from Rs 10,000 to Rs 5,000 p.m.  While this may cause cheers to readers, it should be noted that the in-hand salary of husband is Rs 9,000 p.m, so effectively he has to now survive on Rs 4,000 p.m.  2. MP HC denies maintenance to wife on her CrPC 125 appeal We have this very recent judgment of Madhya Pradesh High Court which denied maintenance to wife under CrPC 125 on her appeal to HC since the court agreed with trial court\u2019s observations that according to evidence led by husband and also wife\u2019s own admissions, it was the wife who was not staying with him out of her own freewill. 3. Qualified wife can\u2019t sit idle and claim maintenance: Mumbai family court Important part of judgment below:  16. The learned counsel for respondent has argued that the petitioner is well qualified and she is earning an amount of Rs.50,000/\u00adper month, she is having sufficient income for her maintenance. It is argued by the learned counsel for respondent that before the police station Worli on 12.11.2011 the petitioner has given statement u/s 161 of Cr.P.C. The petitioner has admitted that she has completed degree in Food and Science Nutrician, she had worked as a dietician, she is Post Graduate in Dietician field, she had also worked with Larcen and Tubro etc. but at present she is not working. The above statement made by the petitioner clearly shows that she is well qualified and able to do job. 4. Woman can\u2019t evict husband just because she pays EMI: Mumbai Family Court MUMBAI: A family court on Monday rejected a wife\u2019s interim plea seeking her estranged husband\u2019s removal from their Lokhandwala flat where she stays with him and their child, just because she pays the EMI (equated monthly installment to repay home loan). The court, while ruling in favour of the man who pays Rs 90,000 a month for household expenses, said in the current day, it is difficult to ascertain who has contributed how much while purchasing any asset or discharging any liability. \u201cIf both contribute to the household, either this way or that way, a particular spouse cannot claim exclusive right, ownership or title in the household property, merely because either the property stands in her name or she has contributed financially,\u201d said the judge. 5. Delhi HC judgment in CrPC 125 maintenance, rejects one-third rule, both have income The judgment asserts that there is no strict criterion that one-third of husband\u2019s income has necessarily to be awarded as maintenance to wife. The judgment can be useful to know how judges may ascertain income of both parties based on declarations in affidavit, and some estimation of real income (because people just lie about income). 6. Multiple maintenance under DV Act denied when CrPC 125 already decided. when CrPC 125 already decided 7. Mumbai HC disallows multiple maintenance under CrPC 125 when civil suit pending  this case, wife initiated a fresh maintenance petition under CrPC 125 when a civil suit asking for maintenance was already pending, but it was stayed by Mumbai High court. Important parts of judgment below:  Mr. Vidwans, the learned counsel for the applicant submitted that practically pleadings are identical and verbatim in both the cases. He took me through the pleadings of both cases and demonstrated that practically the paras are identical as much as they are in verbatim."

        "query-text": "Hello,       We are a young couple who recently finalized a 2 bhk property in mira road, mumbai around 3 months back.    It so happened,    They are this old couple who own a flat in RNA Broadway Avenue. They have a loan running on the property and as assumed from their conversation, they are economically crunched.    Now when we passed on the property papers to indiabulls, they were giving us requirements for documents like the blueprint and stuffs, and this further slowed down the process of evaluation. The owners then started calling us and pressing us to finalize the deal by making a token payment of 2 lakhs.    We told them that we do not want to commit on so much amount without having any kind of assurity on the amount of loan passed and requested them to wait until we get the evaluation reports. But then they again started emotionally pressurizing us to pay at least a lakh against the token so that they know that thay have to deny other buyers. We gave in to the circumstance without thinking much and paid 50,000 in cash and 50000 in neft.    Then after indiabulls infotmed us that the flat had technical flaws and that the evaluation will need certain documents, and essentially the blue print of the flat. When we requested for the document to the owners, they told us that even their bank did not ask for all those documents while passing their loan and that indiabulls is just fooling around with us. After that they again forced us to pay up another lakh against token and we did the same through neft with doubting any foul.    They then forced us to approach their loan agent who will speeden up the process. We, although having limited funds at that time, again listened to them and approached their loan agent. After another 15 days, the loan agent informed us that, the finance company that he approached, evaluated thr entire flat and said that the flat is actually a 1bhk and not a 2bhk. The first owners had built a mezzanine and a second room on the extra deck area That the builders had provided. We got a shock and then we realised that we were actually at a verge of entering a deal of loss. The owners were charging us a price for 2bhk and it would be a non profitable assest even in future when the building goes for redevelopment or resale. We decided to back off from the deal.    When we informed this to the owners, they are refusing to return the whole money back. When we argued on that further, they are saying that as a norm, we v cant return the token money. After further prodding they are saying that they cant return the entire money but might keep back certain amount.    Now our mistake is we din sign any MoU and paid 50000 in cash. Though we have recorded the owner accepting that we paid them 2 lakhs, we are worried to get our money back   Can we take help of any legal action against them.? They are practiaclly forcing us to buy the house saying that they have deposited 2 lakh in fixed, which is actually wrong on their part. Pls help.",

When I was traveling, my sick mother told me that my two younger brothers had stolen/snatched her bank details, debit card pin number, passwords, signature/thumb impression, etc., and were trying to withdraw the entire amount from her savings and other deposit and mutual fund accounts to their own accounts.       I also have reasonable belief that they in connivance with the bank manager had taken steps to withdraw and transfer the said huge amount from my mother\u2019s accounts to their accounts. I made a complaint about the issues to the bank officials. But no action was taken since they are also party to the criminal action. I also filed Civil Suit before the Civil Forum to restrain them from operating the above said accounts of my mother. In spite of all the legal processes, my younger brothers have transferred all the amount of my sick mother\u2019s accounts to their respective accounts in connivance with the bank officials.\t\t   \t   Hence their acts amount to theft, forgery, cheating, conspiracy and breach of trust.

Petitioner  Through: Mr. M. Dutta, Advocate  versus  UNION OF INDIA ..... Respondent  Through: Mr. Ruchir Mishra, Advocate  CORAM:  HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE VIPIN SANGHI  JUDGMENT VIPIN SANGHI, J. 1. The present writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India has been preferred by Ms. Teesta Chattoraj, a minor through her mother and natural guardian Smt. Rajeshwari Chattoraj. The petitioner seeks issuance of a writ of certiorari quashing the letter dated 04.04.2011 (Ref. No.RPO/PG/133/11) issued by the respondent, i.e. the Regional Passport Officer (RPO), New Delhi, whereby the petitioners request for issuance of a passport has been declined. The petitioner also seeks a writ of mandamus directing the respondent RPO to issue a passport in favour of the petitioner on the basis of the information supplied by the petitioner in her passport application form. 2. The petitioner was born on 15.11.1995 at Kolkata. Her natural parents are Sh. Abhijit Ghosh and Smt. Rajeshwari Ghosh, who is now known as Rajehswari Chattoraj. When the petitioner was only about two years old, the natural parents of the petitioner obtained decree of divorce by mutual consent. So far as the petitioner is concerned, the terms agreed between her natural parents, inter alia, provided that the petitioner's mother will not claim and/or demand of maintenance and/or alimony for the minor child at present or in future from the petitioner's father. It was also agreed that the petitioner's mother would maintain the petitioner. The petitioner's father admitted that he has no right to see the child for all times to come and he will not interfere in any manner regarding rearing up the child by the Opposite party and her family members and that he shall have no right to claim and/or demand for custody of the said child from the Opposite party. 3. The petitioner's mother married Sh. Surojit Chattoraj at New Delhi on 04.03.1999. By registered deed of adoption deed dated 12.06.2006, the petitioner was given in adoption by her mother to her husband Sh. Surojit Chattoraj. The petitioner submits that religious ceremonies to mark the acceptance of the petitioner by her adopted father were also held, and were attended by members and friends of the family. 4. On 26.07.2010, the petitioner applied for a passport, through her mother, to the respondent authority. The petitioner was required to provide, inter alia, the registered adoption deed, which was also provided. After much waiting, the petitioner was informed by the impugned communication that her application could not be accepted, as it had been found on scrutiny that the petitioners biological father's name, as per her birth certificate, had not been mentioned in the passport application form, and the adoption deed was not in accordance with the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (\"HAMA\"). 5. The gist of the communication dated 04.04.2011 issued by the RPO reads as follows: \"On scrutiny of file, it is seen that biological father's name as per birth certificate has not mentioned in the passport application form. The adoption Deed as per Adoption Act is also not valid. As per rules of Ministry of External Affairs Circular No.VI/401/01/05/2008 dated 05.10.2009 serial No.4(2) \"In the event of remarriage after divorce, the name of step- father/step mother cannot be written in the passport of children from the previous marriage. The relationship of the child to his biological parents subsists, even after divorce by parents. It is also not possible to leave the column of father or mother blank in the passport in such cases. Therefore, such applicants must write the names of their biological parents in the application form. However, if the stepfather or stepmother is appointed by a Court as legal guardian, the name of such step-parent can be written as legal guardian\". In view of the instruction, you are advised to furnish a fresh Form-1 with name of biological father or a Court Order appointing you as a Legal Guardian. This may be treated as Final Reminder, your compliance may reach this office within 15 days, failing which you have nothing to say and your complaint may be treated as closed\". (emphasis supplied). 6. Consequently, the petitioner has preferred this petition, accusing the respondent authority of acting arbitrarily, illegally and malafide. 7. The submission of Mr. Dutta, learned counsel for the petitioner is that the respondent RPO has no authority or jurisdiction to deny the issuance of a passport to the petitioner by going into the legality or otherwise of the adoption deed. He submits that the adoption deed has been duly registered. He submits that the RPO cannot question, or sit in judgment over the validity, or otherwise, of the adoption deed. 8. It is argued that the respondent authority does not function as an adjudicating authority, who could rule on the validity or otherwise of the adoption deed. He further submits that the only grounds on which the passport can be refused by the RPO are contained in Section 6 of the Passports Act, 1967, and the ground raised by the RPO, namely, that the adoption deed is not valid is not mentioned as a ground in Section 6 of the Passports Act. 9. It is argued that by declining the passport to the petitioner, the petitioner's fundamental right to travel has been infringed. In support of this submission, learned counsel for the petitioner places reliance upon a decision of the Full Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Pawandeep Singh v. Union of India decided on 07.11.2003, reported as 2003 LawSuit (P&H) 1221, which has been followed subsequently in Satinder Pal Singh Sibia v. Union of India & Anr., 2007 (1) HLR 59. 10. Learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that even otherwise it cannot be said that the adoption deed is not in accordance with the HAMA. It is submitted that Section 9 of HAMA provides that the mother of a child has the capacity to give the child in adoption. He further submits that proviso to Section 9(2) also stands fully satisfied, inasmuch, as, it can be said that the petitioner's natural father has \"finally renounced\" the petitioner's world, inasmuch, as, he had, at the time of obtaining divorce by mutual consent, given up his rights to have anything to do with the petitioner, and he had also renounced his responsibilities towards the petitioner as a father. 11. In support of this submission, learned counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance upon the definition of the expression \"renounce\" and \"renounce the world\" and \"renouncing\", as contained in the Advanced Law Lexicon by P. Ramanatha Aiyar (Third Edition); Black's Law Dictionary (Eighth Edition), and; the Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English (Eighth Edition). 12. He also places reliance on an unreported judgment of the Bombay High Court in Maroti Vitthal Bhatwalkar & Anr. v. Mahila Vikas Mandal, Chandrapur, 2007 (2) AIR Bom R 44, to submit that even when the biological parents are alive, the Court could allow the application of the strangers to take the child in adoption in the interest and welfare of the child. 13. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent submits that the RPO is enjoined by Section 5 of the Passports Act to make such an enquiry as it may consider necessary, and thereafter by an order in writing, either issue the passport or refuse the same. Learned counsel submits that under Section 5(3) of the Passports Act, it is provided that in case a passport is issued with an endorsement or is refused, the passport officer is obliged to record his reasons in brief, which has been done in the present case. 14. He further submits that the Punjab and Haryana High Court while rendering the aforesaid decisions did not consider the opening words of Section 6(1) and 6(2) of the Passports Act, which reads \"Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the passport authority shall refuse .... .... ....\". He submits that apart from the ground specifically mentioned in Section 6, the passport officer can refuse issuance of a passport on the ground that the information furnished by the applicant is incorrect or insufficient, and can require the applicant to resubmit the application by providing the correct and complete information. 15. Learned counsel for the respondent submits that in the petitioner's passport application form, the name of the father was mentioned as that of the adopted father, and not the natural father. During the course of verification of the factual disclosures made in the petitioner's application, the petitioner was required to provide the adoption deed. The adoption deed, though registered, is not valid, since, even a bare perusal of the adoption deed shows that the consent of the natural father has not been obtained, and it is not even the petitioner's case that the petitioner's natural father has either finally renounced the world, or has ceased to be a Hindu, or has been declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be of unsound mind. Reference is made to Section 9(2) of HAMA. 16. It is further argued that merely because the petitioner's father renounced or waived his rights, qua the petitioner, and also gave up his obligations to maintain the petitioner at the time of obtaining divorce by mutual consent, the same cannot be construed as a final renunciation of the world. 17. So far as the submission of the petitioner founded upon the decisions of the Punjab and Haryana High Court is concerned, I reject the same. With utmost respect and with due deference to the Punjab and Haryana High Court, I cannot agree with the view taken in the aforesaid two decisions. 18. In the case of Pawandeep Singh (supra), the passport was refused on the ground that the adoption deed, on the basis of which the passport application was moved, was not valid. In this case, the petitioner was born on 27.08.1989 in Punjab. Both his parents had died by October 1998. His real grandparents gave him in adoption to their other son Shri Satpal Singh and his wife, who were living in Italy, and an adoption deed dated 17.05.1999 was executed and registered in the office of the Sub Registrar, Ludhiana. The respondents contention was that under the provisions of HAMA, Sh. Satpal Singh and his wife, who had sons of their own, could not have adopted the petitioner and, therefore, the adoption was invalid. 19. The Full Bench, after extracting Section 6 of the Passports Act, observed as follows: \"9. A bare perusal of Section 6 afore-mentioned shows that except on four grounds mentioned in Sub Section 1 and nine grounds mentioned in Sub- section 2 of Section 6 on no other ground there could be refusal to grant Passport or travel document. 10. In Ganpathi National Middle School v. M. Durai Khanna, (1996) 6 S.C.C. 464 and State of H.P. v. H.P. State Recognised & Aided Schools Managing Committees and Ors., (1995)4 S.C.C. 507 the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that a child has got a fundamental right of education. In Satwant Singh Sawhney v. D. Ramarathnam, Assistant Passport Officer, A.I.R. 1967 S.C. 1836 it was held to the effect that Article 21 takes in the right of locomotion and to travel abroad. Hidayatullah, J. in his dissenting judgment also considered that there is no doubt a fundamental right to equality in the matter of grant of passports (subject to reasonable classifications). In Mrs. Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, (1978)1 S.C.C. 248, the Apex Court laid down the applicable tests under Article 19 in relation to impounding of passport. Under our constitutional scheme the fundamental right enshrined under Article 21 is available not only to adults or non citizens but also to the minors. The Government cannot deprive the minor's right to have a better education or to live a dignified life, apart from love and affection of his own uncle and Aunt though the stand taken by the Respondents that adoption was not valid is correct since the Aunt and Uncle are having their own sons. This significant aspect of the matter was not considered earlier by the Division Bench. The judgment of the Division Bench has also not considered the provisions of Section 6 of the Act. It is, thus, per inqurium. We are, thus, constrained to overrule this decision. 11. We have no hesitation in holding that the action of the Respondent No. 2 in refusing to grant Passport to the Petitioner in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, is in teeth of Article 14 which is antithesis to any arbitrary action and against the Petitioner's fundamental rights enshrined under Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India\". (Emphasis supplied) 20. With the utmost respect, the Full Bench failed to notice the opening words of Section 6(1) and (2) of the Passports Act. Insofar it is relevant, Section 6 of the Passports Act reads as follows: \"6. Refusal of passports, travel documents, etc. - (1) Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the passport authority shall refuse to make an endorsement for visiting any country under clause (b) or clause (c) of sub- section (2) of section 5 on any one or more of the following grounds, and on no other ground, namely:--  (a) .... .... ....  (b) .... .... ....  (c) .... .... ....  (d) .... .... .... (2) Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the passport authority shall refuse to issue a passport or travel document for visiting any foreign country under clause (c) of sub- section (2) of section 5 on any one or more of the following grounds, and on no other ground, namely:--  (a) .... .... ....  (b) .... .... ....  (c) .... .... ....  .... .... ....  (i) .... .... ......\". 21. The Full Bench also did not notice Section 5(2) and (3) of the Passports Act, which reads as follows: \"5. Applications for passports, travel documents, etc. and orders thereon. - ... .... .... ...... .... ..... ..... ..... ..... ..... ..... ..... (2) On receipt of an application [under this section,] the passport authority, after making such inquiry, if any, as it may consider necessary, shall, subject to the other provisions of this Act, by order in writing,- (a) issue the passport or travel document with endorsement or, as the case may be, make on the passport or travel document the endorsement, in respect of the foreign country or countries specified in the application; or (b) issue the passport or travel document with endorsement, or, as the case may be, make on the passport or travel document the endorsement, in respect of one or more of the foreign countries specified in the application and refuse to make an endorsement in respect of the other country or countries; or (c) refuse to issue the passport or travel document or, as the case may be, refuse to make on the passport or travel document any endorsement. (3) Where the passport authority makes an order under clause (b) or clause (c) of sub- section (2) on the application of any person, it shall record in writing a brief statement of its reasons for making such order and furnish to that person on demand a copy of the same unless in any case the passport authority is of the opinion that it will not be in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of India, friendly relations of India with any foreign country or in the interests of the general public to furnish such copy\". (Emphasis supplied) 22. The observations made by the Full Bench that except for the four grounds mentioned in sub section (1) and nine grounds mentioned in sub section (2) of Section 6, the passport officer could not refuse the passport or travel documents on any other ground, clearly misses the opening words of Section 6(1) and 6(2) \"Subject to the other provisions of this Act ..... ..... ......\". Pertinently, the Full Bench also acknowledges that the stand taken by the passport authority, to the effect that the adoption was not valid, was correct. However, it directed issuance of a passport on considerations of breach of Article 21 of the Constitution, in case the passport was denied to the applicant. 23. An application for seeking issuance of a passport is required to be made under Section 5(1) and on receipt of an application, the passport authority is required to make his enquiry and thereafter pass an order. He may either decide to issue the passport in terms of clause (a) of Section 5(2), or to issue a passport with an endorsement, or refuse to make an endorsement in respect of some countries in terms of clause (b) of Section 5(2), or he may altogether refuse to issue a passport under clause (c) of Section 5(2). In case he passes an order under clause (b) and/or (c) of Section 5(2), he is required to record brief reasons therefor. Therefore, if the details and particulars mentioned in a passport application by an applicant are found to be incorrect or deficient upon a scrutiny of the application and the documents produced in support of it, the passport authority is not obliged to issue a passport, merely because such a case may not be covered by the ground contained in Section 6(1) or 6(2) of the Passports Act. 24. Take, for example, a case where the applicant mentions his wrong name, or wrong name of his parents; his incorrect address; his incorrect date of birth and makes false declaration with regard to such other information, as may be required to be furnished in the application. It is quite possible that none of such information may actually be covered by the grounds contained in clauses (a) to (d) of Section 6(1) or clauses (a) to (i) of Section 6(2) of the Act. Does it mean that the passport authority, despite finding such inaccuracies in the application form, is obliged to issue a passport merely because the ground contained in Section 6(1) and 6(2) are not made out? In my view, the obvious and plain answer has to be a \"No\". 25. The Parliament deliberately used the words \"Subject to the other provisions of this Act\" in Section 6(1) and 6(2) of the Act, to take care of all such situations. In my view, what Section 6(1) and 6(2) of the Act provide is that if the application of the applicant is otherwise found to be complete and truthful in respect of the information required to be provided in the application for issuance of a passport or for seeking an endorsement thereon, the same may still be refused for the grounds mentioned in Section 6(1) and 6(2) respectively. Pertinently, the present cannot be even termed as a refusal to issue a passport to the petitioner altogether. All that the petitioner has been informed is to make correction in the information provided in the application form and to resubmit the same. 26. The fundamental right available under Article 21, which includes the right of locomotion and to travel abroad, is subject to reasonable restrictions. It cannot be said that a citizen has a right to obtain a passport by furnishing incorrect or wrong information with regard to his name, age, address or parentage. He cannot claim that non issuance of the passport with incorrect/false information is infringing his fundamental right of locomotion or to travel abroad. In my view, it cannot be said that the passport authority has no jurisdiction whatsoever to go into the issue of correctness or otherwise of the adoption deed, even in case where, on the face of it, the said adoption deed appears to be in contravention of the law. The enquiry that the passport authority is required to undertake under Section 5 of the Passport Act is a serious enquiry. Such an enquiry cannot be done cursorily or perfunctorily. If, during the course of the enquiry, it comes to the notice of the passport authority that the documents provided by the applicant did not support the claims made by the applicant in his application for issuance of a passport, he would not only be entitled, but would be duty bound to raise the issue with the applicant. A passport is not only a travel document, but is also an identity document. The identity of a person is determined, inter alia, by his parentage. Therefore, unless there is a legal adoption of the applicant, he/she is bound to give the name of his/her natural parents and cannot choose to provide the name of the adopted parent(s) in his/her application form. 27. I now proceed to consider the submissions of learned counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner's adoption deed in favour of Shri Surojit Chattoraj is valid. Sections 9(1) and 9(2) of the HAMA are relevant and reads as follows:- \"9. Persons capable of giving in adoption.- (1) No person except the father or mother or the guardian of a child shall have the capacity to give the child in adoption. (2) Subject to the provisions of sub-section (4), the father or the mother, if alive, shall have equal right to give a son or daughter in adoption: Provided that such right shall not be exercised by either of them save with the consent of the other unless one of them has completely and finally renounced the word or has ceased to be a Hindu or has been declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be of unsound mind.\" 28. From the aforesaid reading, it is clear that both parents of a child, if alive, have equal right to give the child in adoption. Therefore, the right of the petitioner's mother, Smt. Rajeshwari Chattoraj to give the petitioner in adoption cannot be questioned. However, the law is very clear that such right cannot be exercised by either of the parents of the child \"save with the consent of the other, unless one of them has deliberately and finally renounced the world or has ceased to be a Hindu or has been declared by a Court of competent jurisdiction to be of unsound mind.\" Consequently, the consent of the petitioner's natural father was required to give the petitioner in adoption to Surojit Chattoraj. However, such consent would not be necessary if the petitioner's natural father had, inter alia, \"finally renounced the world\". 29. The issue is whether, in the facts of this case, it can be said that the petitioner's father, Shri Abhijit Ghosh has finally renounced the world. 30. The petitioner has placed reliance on the meaning of the expression \"renounce\" and \"renounce the world\" contained in the Advanced Law Lexicon by P. Ramanatha Aiyer 3rd Edition 2007 Reprint. \"Renounce\" is said to mean \"to give up a right; surrender; abandon, refuse to recognize any longer (as) to renounce treaty principles, authority, heirship, etc. \"Renounce the world\" would mean \"to withdraw from worldly interests in order to lead a spiritual life.\" Reference is made to Section 13(1)(vi) of the Hindu Marriage Act. The expression \"renouncing\" means \"making formal resignation of some right or trust especially of one's position as heir or executor\". The Black's Law Dictionary Eighth Edition explains the expression \"renounce\" to mean \"to give up or abandon formally (a right or interest); to disclaim (renounce an inheritance), to refuse to follow or obey; to decline to recognize or observe (renounce one's allegiance)\". The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English defines the expression \"renounce\" as \"consent formally to abandon; surrender; give up ( a claim, right, possession, etc); repudiate; refuse to recognize any longer (renouncing their father's authority); a decline further association or disclaim relationship with (renounced my former friends); withdraw from; discontinue; forsake; refuse or resign a right or position esp., as an heir or trustee\". \"Renounce the world\" means \"abandon society or material affairs.\" 31. From the reading of aforesaid definitions and meaning, no doubt, it could be said that the natural father of the petitioner, Shri Abhijit Ghosh has renounced his rights and obligations qua, the petitioner and the petitioner's mother renounced her rights qua the natural father, Shri Abhijit Ghosh. But can it be said that the petitioner's natural father has \"renounced the world\"? 32. In my view, on a plain grammatical and literal interpretation of the said words, it cannot be said that the petitioner's natural father Shri Abhijit Ghosh has renounced the world, as the renounciation of the world by a person would involve and entail his severing his relationships with all other human beings and would also entail the giving up of all material wealth and pleasures. 33. In Madhusudhan Mohapatra Vs. Gobind Sabat and Another, AIR 1965 Orrisa 54, the High Court takes note of an earlier decision reported as Baldeo Prasad Vs. Arya Pritinidhi Sabha, AIR 1930 ALL 643, where the Court took the view that the mere fact that a person declares that he has become a sanyasi or that he has described himself as such, or wears clothes ordinarily worn by the sanyasis would not make him a perfect sanyasi. He must not only retire from the worldly interests and become dead to the world, but to attain this, he must perform the necessary ceremonies without which the renunciation will not be complete. 34. It is not even the petitioner's case that Shri Abhijit Ghosh has, in that wider and natural sense, renounced the world. All that the petitioner contends is that Shri Abhijit Ghosh, her natural father, has not no concern with the petitioner any longer. Had the intention of the legislature been to exclude the consent of that parent, who may have cut off all his relationship with the minor child, on account of the divorce obtained by the parents, the legislature would not have used the expression \"renounce the world\" but would have used the words like \"severed his or her relationship with the minor child\" instead. It is not for this Court to read into the plain language used by the legislature, words which are not there. 35. The petitioner's mother could not have secured the right, at the time of her obtaining divorce from Shri Abhijit Ghosh, to claim that the petitioner was not the naturally born child of her natural father, Shri Abhijit Ghosh. The petitioner's mother also could not have taken away the petitioner's right to claim that Shri Abhijit Ghosh is her natural father. The petitioner's right to claim her status as the daughter and an heir of Shri Abhijit Ghosh also could not have been taken away by her mother by entering into a compromise with her natural father. The rights which inhere in the petitioner on account of her being a natural heir of her natural father continue to survive. The identity of the petitioner is derived by the fact that the petitioner is the naturally born child of her parents i.e. Shri Abhijit Ghosh and Smt. Rajeshwari Ghosh, now known as Smt. Rajeshwari Chattoraj. The settlement arrived at between the petitioner's parents at the time when they obtained the divorce cannot be said to include an implied consent by the petitioner's father to the giving in adoption of the petitioner to any other person. 36. The decision relied upon by the petitioner in the case of Maroti Vitthal Bhatwalkar (supra), though founded upon a different factual matrix does support the petitioner's argument. However, I have difficulty following the said decision in the light of the clear and express language used in Sections 5 and 6 of the HAMA. These provisions read as follows:- \"5. Adoptions to be regulated by this Chapter- (1) No adoption shall be made after the commencement of this Act by or to a Hindu except in accordance with the provisions contained in this Chapter, and any adoption made in contravention of the said provisions shall be void. (2) An adoption which is void shall neither create any rights in the adoptive family in favour of any person which he or she could not have acquired except by reason of the adoption, nor destroy the rights of any person in the family of his or her birth. 6. Requisites of a valid adoption.- No adoption shall be valid unless- (i) the person adopting has the capacity, and also the right, to take in adoption; (ii) the person giving in adoption has the capacity to do so; (iii) the person adopted is capable of being taken in adoption; and (iv) the adoption is made in compliance with the other conditions mentioned in this Chapter.\" 37. It is pertinent to note that both Sections 5 and 6 of the HAMA begin with the words \"no adoption shall be made........\" and \"no adoption shall be valid unless.........\" It is, therefore, clear that both these provisions are mandatory. From a reading of Section 5, it is clear that an adoption not made in accordance with the provisions of Chapter II of the HAMA is void. The adoption is not valid unless the person giving in adoption has the capacity to do so and the adoption is made in compliance with the conditions mentioned in Chapter II of the HAMA, which would include the condition mentioned in the proviso to Section 9(2) of the said Act. 38. For all the aforesaid reasons, I dismiss this petition leaving it open to the petitioner to comply with the objections raised by the RPO and to resubmit her application with the correct details, inter alia, with regard to her parentage. The parties are left to bear their respective costs. (VIPIN SANGHI) JUDGE MARCH 30, 2012 sr/as"

Wo log mujhe Noida me rahne bhi nahi de rahe hain.    Meri un logon se jo ladayi hai uski detail-           Wo log bachpan se hi mujhse kahte aaye the ki mai unki ladki Rachna se apne parents ke against jaker marriage kar lu. Jab mai Noida job karne gaya tab Rachna ne mujhe propose kiya, mai bhi use like karta tha isliye maine accept kar liya, iske baad mere or Rachna ke beech me \"Marriage like Relationship\" ban gaya. Idhar mere parants ne meri marriage tay di. Jis din mai mai apni shadi ke liye Noida se ghar aanewala tha us din Rachna mere room par aayi or mujhe dhamki di ki abhi mere mere sath abhi shadi karo chalkar nahi to mai isi room me sucide kar loongi or mere room me rakha samaan uthakar todne lagi, poori building me tamasha hone laga isliye maine uski baat maante huve Noida ke mandir me marriage kar li lekin us marriage ko court me register nahi karva saka. Usi raat mai apne ghar Kanpur aa gaya jahan par meri shadi Pooja ke sath ho gayi. Shadi ke baad jab meri wife Pooja mere sath mere room par rahne aayi to Rachna mere room par meri wife se ladne aa jati or usse kahti ki mai Alok ki pahli wife hu tu yahan kyo aayi hai, wo meri wife se khud pahli wife hone ka hak maangti thi or kahti thi ki tum Alok ko divorce de do mai uske sath rahoongi or jab tumhara divorce ho jaye to uske paper mujhe dikha du. Rachna mujhe phone karke dhamki deti thi ki Pooja se divorce lo nahi to mai tumhe doosri shadi karne or sexual harassment ke case me jail me band karva doongi.           31 May 2013 ko subha wo log mere phir se mere room par aaye or kafi ladayi karne ke baad meri bike utha le gaye jiski maine police me complaint ki to policewalon ne meri bike dila di or hmare beech compromise hua ki ab wo log dobara hame pareshan nahi karenge or ham log Noida me nahi rahenge.           06 June 2013 ko Rachna ne dobara ham logon se compromise kiya or meri wife ko call karke kaha ki tum Alok ko divorce de do mai Alok ki first wife hu mai uske sath rahoongi, jab divorce ho jaye to uske paper mujhe dikha dena. In sabse tang aaker meri wife or uske gharwalon ne ham logon ne par jhooth bolkar shadi karne ka aarop laga diya hai or last 6-7 monthe se dono family divorce karne par baat kar rahe hain or finally abhi 25Feb2014 ko hmara mutual case file ho gaya hai or one time settlement me hame 6Lakh rs unko dene hain. Meri wife ne mere sath rahne se saaf mana kar diya hai.

Last time jab meri Rachna se baat huyi thi to usne mujhse kaha tha ki mujhe divorce paper dikha do mai tumhare sath rahne aa jaaungi. Maine jo bhi likha hai use prove kiya ja sakta hai.   Kya mai kisi legally tareeke se unko approach kar sakta hu or Rachna ne ham logon se 06 June ko jo compromise kiya tha use poora karne ke liye force kar sakta hu?    Or ab agar Rachna meri first wife hone se mana karti hai to kya mai uske against koi case file kar sakta hu kyoki usne meri wife k saamne khud ko meri first wife bana rakha hai?   Agar Rachna first wife hone se mana karti hai to kya mai money claim ka case kar sakta hu  or Mujhe un logon se apni safty karne ke liye kya legally step lene chahiye?   Plzzz advice me.",

Laws Related to NRI Divorce A growing trend among Indian men and women can be seen to get married to NRIs. According to the recent statistical data, 225 women from metro cities get married to NRIs every year and out of these around 25 want to end their marriage due to reasons of hiding facts or of deception. This is the reason why it is important for Indians who marry NRIs to have knowledge of laws related to NRI divorce. Many of NRI weddings end in divorce due to the reasons like:  The NRI spouses inflate their assets like home, high paid job, or vehicle in the foreign country but actually might not be in a position to support a family after marriage. The NRI spouse happens to have another spouse, settled with him abroad. The NRI spouse feels that Indian spouse is not a suitable partner in coping up with him and his advanced lifestyle and hence, seeks divorce on the grounds of incompatibility.  However, The Process Needs one to Furnish the Following Information for Completion of Divorce Process:  Where was one married? India or Abroad Does one have children? Will both be able to reach a financial settlement of their possessions? What is the religion of both the partners? Which country is one based in? What is his or her nationality?  Even though, there are not many laws to protect the interest of Indians who marry NRIs but due to rise in the number of troubled marriages of NRIs with Indians, the government is introducing NGOs in both India as well as abroad and these shall guide Indian men and women who are married to NRIs and settled abroad. They offer emotional support, counseling, and legal advice in the process of divorce and separation. Another thing to be kept in mind is that even if the divorce is taking place abroad, it would be good to appoint an attorney who is proficient in Indian divorce laws related to NRIs. The Basic Laws Related to NRI Divorce, That One Must be Well Aware of are:  If both the spouses are settled in USA, or any other foreign country, then they can seek divorce by mutual consent under the foreign marriages divorce laws of that country. If both the spouses are Indians and have been married under Hindu marriage Act 1955, in that case they can seek divorce with mutual consent under section 13-B."

He thinks she is uneducated and can't get a job anywhere and keeps torturing her on the same point. Though she is graduated and worked before marriage. Last year, she was beaten by him, so we registered an NC and took her to my home. She was at my home for around 8 months. He was not even asked her to come home. Once she returned home with her daughter. That time she got to know that his husband is dating another girl working in his office. When she asked him who is she, he accepted that she is my girlfriend and told her that you were dating your boyfriend for 8 months so now I have a girlfriend. But when we asked him what is going on he refused to accept it. He is treating her like a person who only responsible to cook and serve him. By the way, his parents stay at their village and they don't interfere with his son's activities. They just ignore it, saying that the girl is only an office friend of him. One day my sister got his chat history with that girl having romantic kisses and movie plans. He does not give any money for home expenses to my sister saying he has to pay the EMIs, but gifts headphones, a new mobile phone to that girl.      Now during this Diwali, there was again an argument between husband and wife for the jewelry. My sister told him that I have sold my jewelry and got the money to make the food for him, but in reality, she didn't. That time he bit her on her hand and asked to leave his home shouting at her. Also told her that, now he will surely do second marriage with that girl. Then my sister got angry and hit him with a broom. Then he ran away by locking the door from outside. His father was also there when this happened but he did not say anything.      She called us to take her along with us. Then we took her and went to the Police station and registered the NC about everything happened. Now she is living with us. She is saying I don't want to spend my life with a person who is characterless and claiming me as a characterless.      Now I just wanted to take advice from a lawyer to take the next actions. We are not sure what should we do next, should we send her back to live a slave life, should we keep her to live along with us, in that case, can she get money or claim right in his property for a living? As her daughter is 3 years old, she is worried about her education.      Also after 4 years of marriage, he did not even bother to create a marriage certificate. So we don't have a marriage certificate but we do have a birth certificate of her daughter.      Please guide any help would be appreciated.      Thanks,   Pravin",

Vashdev, Aged about 71 years, Door No.118, 26th Cross, 6th Block, Jayanagar, Bengaluru \u2013 560070, (Mob:[deleted]), do hereby state on oath as under: 1.\tThat I am defendant No.1 in this case as such know the full facts of this case. The plaintiff filed the present suit claiming himself as a co-sharer of the property and on the other hand claiming to the absolute owner of the suit schedule property. If at all he is co-owner he ought to have obtained consent of other co-owners by way of Power of Attorney before filing the suit. He entirely stated falsehood in his affidavit and also in his plaint which were declared by on ought as true and correct and also verified the plaint contents. Thus the very contrary contentions taken by the plaintiff in this case goes to show that he attempted to mislead this Hon\u2019ble Court in order to grab illegal possession of suit schedule property. 2.\t When false affidavit or false documents were given in any quasi judicial or administrative proceedings, then a private complaint can be filed U/s 200 before competent magistrate. The Plaintiff claims to be a co owner of the Property. The Plaintiff has filed a suit for property partition against his family hence the said property rights are not with clear Titles. The Plaintiff has not disclosed the truth. 3.\tThe deponent further states that, the Plaintiff submits that the 1 Defendant is a uncle. The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has been tying a Rakhi to the wife of the 1 Defendant therefore the relationship changes. The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has deliberately not disclosed the true fact. 4.\tThe deponent further states that, the lease agreement was not made with any favors. The deponent further states that, the lease agreement was drawn with a intention of generating a Revenue so as to meet the Legal expenditure of Property Settlements Suit and other expenses. The 1 Defendant has been paying Property taxes and Property maintenance charges from the day the Plaintiff has entrusted the authority to the 1Defendant. The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has not disclosed to the Honourable Court with a intention of misleading the true facts. 5.\tThe Plaintiff claim that he has not received the security deposit of Rs.100000 is also false as the 1 Defendant had made a expense of the amount to get his wife a bail and providing a bond to the High Ground Police Station as she was involved in a Criminal Case. 6.\tThe deponent further states that, the Plaintiff statement stating that the Defendant 1 has not done anything is completely false. The Defendant 1 has arranged for the Plaintiff Funds for his lively hood and the main house for him to live undisturbed with complete privacy. 7.\tThe deponent further states that, the Plaintiff brother filled a police complaint against the Defendant as trespassing the said property. The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff made the Defendant file a suit for Injunction against his brother an himself. 8.\tThe Plaintiff voluntarily put a sub lease clause for the benefit of the Defendant No.1 as services rendered. 9.\tThe deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has never demanded any money as he knew that the Defendant No.1 is spending for his problems. As a matter of fact his wife has been taking funds from the Defendant No.1 from time to time for her Case against her mother in law. The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has willingly extended the lease agreement on the ninth day of June 2014. 10.\t The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has no need for the property as he loves to live in his father house which is very dear to him in remembrance of his late Father. The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has executed a will in favour of the Defendant and also promised fifth percent of his share. He has promised in front of his Uncle and Aunty Mr. and Mrs. Beharilal Bathija when we went to attend a Marriage of his niece. Thus the conduct of the plaintiff invites criminal offences as such a criminal case as to be registered in view of documents available on record that is his own plaint and its verification and his other pleadings and affidavits. The entire documents and pleadings filed by the plaintiff and defendant No.1 shall be read as part of this affidavit. 11.\t Thus it has been established the plaintiff mislead this Court for the purpose of misleading the lawful authority thus plaintiff needs to be tried for the alleged offences which may be disclosed during the course of investigation and likely to disclose offences u/s 191,193,195,199 of IPC, 1860and be punished accordingly.

                "response-text": "Kerala High Court Vishalakshi vs Bank Of India on 6 April, 2006 Equivalent citations: AIR 2006 Ker 255, 2006 (2) KLT 488 Author: V Ramkumar Bench: K Denesan, V Ramkumar JUDGMENT V. Ramkumar, J. 1. In this appeal filed under Section 384 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 the petitioner who is the sole legal heir and successor of deceased P.K. Hymavathy, challenges the order dated [deleted] passed by the Subordinate Judge, Ernakulam in Succession O.P. 20/05. The said original petition was filed under Sections 371 and 372 of the Indian Succession Act praying for a succession certificate in respect of certain bank deposits totaling to Rs. 1,95,695.73 and in respect of 6 cents of landed property with a building thereon. Even though the court below as per the impugned order held that the appellant is the sole legal heir of the said Hymavathy who died intestate on 29-1-2004 and allowed the original petition granting a succession certificate in respect of the bank deposits which were detailed in Schedule I of the Original Petition, that court disallowed relief in respect of the immovable property described in I schedule to the said original petition. It is aggrieved by that part of the impugned order which has declined to grant a succession certificate in respect of the immovable property that the appellant has preferred this appeal. 2. We heard Adv. Sri.P.K. Ibrahim, the learned Counsel appearing for the appellant. Assailing the impugned order the learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that Sections 30 and 192 of the Indian Succession Act will indicate that a succession certificate can be granted in respect of immovable properties as well. 3. We are afraid that we find ourselves unable to agree with the above submissions. The fact that the appellant is the sole legal heir and successor of P.K. Hymavathi who died intestate on 29-1-2004 is beyond the pale of controversy. Ext. A2 is the death certificate pertaining to Hymavathi. Her husband Karunakaran had predeceased her as evidenced by Ext. A1 death certificate. Part X of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\" for short) starting from Sections 370 to 390, deals with succession certificate. Sub-section 1 of Section 370 reads as follows: 370: Restriction on grant of certificates under this Part: (1) A succession certificate (hereinafter in this Part referred to as a certificate) shall not be granted under this Part with respect to any debt or security to which a right is required by Section 212 or Section 213 to be established by letters of administration or probate: Provided that nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to prevent the grant of a certificate to any person claiming to be entitled to the effects of a deceased Indian Christian, or to any part thereof, with respect to any debt or security, by reason that a right thereto can be established by letters of administration under this Act. 4. A reading of Sections 370 and 372 of the Act, particularly, Clause (f) of Sub-section (1) of Section 372 of the Act, will show that a succession certificate can be applied for only in respect of debts and securities. The expression \"Debt\" has not been defined under the Act. The said expression has not been defined under the General Clauses Act as well. If so, one has to go by the ordinary meaning of the said expression. A debt means any pecuniary liability whether payable in presenti or in future to another in return for money, services, goods or any other obligation . A debt is also property in the form of a chose in action and is heritable and assignable as understood in law. In the case of securities Sub-section 2 of Section 370 of the Act enumerates the various securities envisaged by the section. They are as under: (a) any promissory note, debenture, stock or other security of the Central Government or of a State Government; (b) any bond, debenture, or annuity charged by Act of Parliament (of the United Kingdom) on the revenues of India; (c) any stock or debenture of, or share in, a company or other incorporated institution: (d) any debenture or other security for money issued by, or on behalf of, a local authority; (e) any other security which the (State Government) may, by notification in the Official Gazette, declare to be a security for the purposes of this Part. The fact that a succession certificate can be issued only in respect of a debt or security is further reinforced from the wording of Sub-section (3) of Section 372 which clarifies that an application for a succession certificate can be made in respect of any debt or debts due to a deceased creditor or in respect of portions there of. Section 376 of the Act makes provision for the grant of extension of succession certificate to any additional debt or security. Section 377 of the Act says that the certificate as well as extension of certificate shall be in the forms set forth in Schedule VIII of the Act. The said Forms read as follows: FORMS OF CERTIFICATE AND EXTENDED CERTIFICATE In the Court of To A.B. Whereas you applied on the...day of...for a certificate under Part X of the Indian Succession Act, 1925, in respect of the following debts and securities, namely: DEBTS Serial no. Name of debtor Amount of debts, Description and including interest, date of instrument on the date of if any, by which the application for certificate debt is secured SECURITIES Serial No. Description Market valueof Distinguishing Name,titleor Amount of par security on date Security number or letter of class of security valueof of of application security for certificate This certificate is accordingly granted to you and empowers you to collect those debts and to receive interest on dividends to negotiate to transfer those securities.  Dated this day of District Judge  In the Court of   On the application of A.B. made to me on the day of....I hereby extend the certificate to   the following debts and securities, namely:  DEBTS Serial no. Name of debtor Amount of debt, Description and the  including interest, date of instrument,  on the date of if any, by which the  application for extension debt is secured  SECURITIES  Serial No. Description  Distinguishing Name, title or Amount of par Market valueof  Security number or letter of class of value security ondate  security security of application  for extension   This extension empowers A.B. to collect those debts and to receive interest on dividends to negotiate to transfer those securities: Dated this.... day of.... ...District Judge. By virtue of Section 380 of the Act, a succession certificate granted under Part X of the Act shall have effect throughout India. The effect of issuing a Succession Certificate is that it will afford full indemnity to all persons owing the debts or liable on the securities specified in the certificate as regards all payments made or dealings had in good faith in respect of such debts or securities or with the grantee of the Succession Certificate. (Vide Section 381), A Succession Certificate issued under Part X of the Act is liable to be revoked for any of the following grounds: a) that the proceedings to obtain the certificate were defective in substance. b) that the certificate was obtained fraudulently by the making of a false suggestion, or by the concealment from the Court of something material to the case; c) that the certificate was obtained by means of an untrue allegation of a fact essential in point of law to justify the grant thereof, though such allegation was made in ignorance or inadvertently; d) that the certificate has become useless and inoperative through circumstances; e) that a decree or order made by a competent Court in a suit or other proceedings with respect to effects comprising debts or securities specified in the certificate renders if proper that the certificate should be revoked. (Vide Section 383 of the Act) 5. Section 371 of the Act gives an indication regarding the court having a jurisdiction to grant succession certificate. It is the District Judge within whose jurisdiction the deceased ordinarily resided at the time of his death or if at that time he had no fixed place of residence, the District Judge within whose jurisdiction any part of the property of the deceased may be found, who is empowered to issue a Succession Certificate. Section 388 of the Act confers power on the State government to invest any inferior court with the power to exercise the functions of a District Judge. In exercise of the said power the State of Kerala in the Home Department has issued the following notification dated 31-1-1958:   Home (C) Department  Notifications  I  (i)  C.NO. 29988/57/HD. Dated, Trivandrum, 31st January 1958   In exercise of the powers conferred by Sub-section (ql) of Section 388 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 (Act XXXIX of 1925), and in supersession of all previous notifications investing courts of subordinate judges with power to exercise the functions of a District Judge under Part X of the said Act, the Government of Kerala hereby invest all courts of subordinate Judges in the State with power to exercise the functions of a District Judge under Part X of the Act within the local limits of their respective jurisdiction. (ii) In exercise of the powers conferred by Sub-section (21) of Section 388 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 (Act XXXIX of 1925) and in supersession of all previous notifications investing courts of Munsiffs with power to exercise the functions of a District Judge under Part X of the Act, the Government of Kerala hereby invest all courts of Munsiffs in the State with power to exercise the functions of a District Judge under Part X of the Act within the local limits of their respective jurisdiction. By order of the Governor, N.E.S. Raghavachari, Chief Secretary After the said notification, both the Munsiffs courts as well as the Sub Courts in the State have concurrent jurisdiction to issue Succession Certificate. 6. As in the case of probate or letters of administration (vide Francis v Antony 1991 (1) KLT 62 there is no limitation for approaching the court for the grant of a Succession Certificate. (See Janaki v. Kesavalu - ILR 8 Madras 207). If a Succession Certificate has been issued to a person not entitled to the same, it can be revoked under Section 383 (e) of the Act. Sections 30 and 192 of the Act on which reliance was placed by the learned Counsel for the appellant, do not support the view canvassed by him. The deeming provision under Section 30 of the Act is for considering the circumstances under which a deceased person could be said to have died intestate. Section 192 to 207 are mainly intended to curb interlopers from meddling with the property of the deceased and are in the nature of summary procedure which is subject to the right of either party to bring a regular suit as saved by Section 208 of the Act. 7. Thus the court below was perfectly justified in declining to grant a succession certificate in respect of the immovable property described in the II Schedule of the O.P. We see no reason to interfere with the order passed by the Subordinate Judge. The result of the forgoing discussion is that this appeal which is bereft of any merit is liable to be dismissed and we do so. However, in the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs."

        "query-text": "I purchased a flat in Mumbai in 2009, jointly with my mother, though I paid the full EMI. My parents have their jointly owned flat in Kolkata where they are owners and have rented it out. Since 2009, I was staying in Mumbai flat with parents and moved out in 2012 as I got married and visit my flat once a year however my parents continued staying there and continued giving their Kolkata flat on rent. Since 2018 my elder divorcee sister who was staying on rent in Mumbai, moved to my Mumbai flat and my parents sold all my furnitures to keep my sister's furnitures in my flat. Seeing a continuous stay of my sister in Mumbai flat I asked my mother to do a gift deed in my name so that incase of any unforseen situation, sister shouldn't claim from mother's 50% portion.       Relation with my sister has become bad since the time I purchased the flat as she always complains she couldn't purchase a house till now and also because she couldn't settle down in her personal life since her divorce. Recently after an incident with my sister, I have asked her to move out of my flat because it has become unbearable for me to listen to her sarcastic comments every now and then.      Since then my parents have started fighting with me that it's their flat too (though they haven't paid any EMIs) and if they are there in the flat, sister would definitely come and stay. Also parents are saying as they have paid monthly maintenance, property tax every year they also have rights in my flat. To which I had to reply as they were staying in mumbai flat hence they paid those otherwise I could have easily kept tenants to pay EMI, maintenance, tax everything and save my salary instead. After that, they asked for 6 lacs as they have painted the flat and have put tiles etc (which they did without any discussion with me) & I replied again that you did it for your convience but I never asked you to do it.      As the relation between me and parents have became so sour, I feel a legal help is required as they are still staying in my flat even after gift deed.      Questions -    1. In gift deed there is no such clause that I have to pay any money to my parents or keep them in my flat till they are alive. Rather it is mentioned that donor will peacefully vacate or handover the flat to donee. Hence, can they still cancel the gift deed?      2. They are still paying the maintenance of flat every month even when I asked them not to pay after the heated argument. Can they legally claim my flat just because they are still paying the maintenance?      3. As the relation got sour and I am feeling uncomfortable to visit my own flat while they are there, I want to vacate my mumbai flat and give it on rent. So how to vacate my flat legally as my parents are not ready for a peaceful discusssion with me? If they don't vacate the house even after legal court notice or evict suit, what max I can do?",

We may have wanted different things from life, but life\u2019s got its own plan as well. A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that\u2019s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. All marriages have ups and downs.  Divorce in India is no longer the rare breed of animal we get to hear about in a distant world. \u2018Divorce\u2019 or the big D word is now heard more frequently than before. I have come across many cases in which one of the reason for divorce in India is women are becoming more independent. Another factor that contributes to this increasing trend of divorce in India is the fact that women are psychologically and financially more independent now leading them to break free from what can be termed as \u201crestraining\u201d or \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d marriages. Educated working women may not have the time needed to focus on running the household and this creates a lot of stress on the family resulting in divorce. I would firstly suggest you to sort out the issue amicably. You can visit the mediation centre in Bangalore.  A good mediator will: \u2022\tHelp both of you discuss your future instead of arguing about your past relationship; \u2022\tHelp to build trust and agreement through an open and transparent good-faith negotiation; \u2022\tEmpower both you and your spouse to make the decisions that are in your mutual best interests and the best interests of your children. Please understand that in India if one spouse says no to divorce, the other can run around the courts all the way till Supreme Court, and judges can't grant divorce based on ground of Irretrievable breakdown of marriage. Legal options are always available for you. If things are not sorted amicably out then you can file an application under section 9 of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (HMA) for restitution of conjugal rights (RCR). It states that if one of the spouses abandons the other without any reasonable cause, the aggrieved party has a legal right to file a petition in the matrimonial court for restitution of conjugal rights.

I live abroad and filed for divorce abroad and although she opposed the divorce, she secretly got married to her ex-boyfriend. She had hidden the information even during the divorce proceedings (so she committed bigamy). She has custody of our only daughter.    She also managed to file a NBW against me, but I never got any summons served to me. My family members are all on AB. But I am not. I have not been asked to go to India by the lawyers we had. I have not seen my family in person for a very long time.       We had filed a quash petition in the High court, to quash the FIR. It was at the state 'quash admission' (and it changes daily) Although there were a few hearings, and the judge asked us to go for compromise, the case keeps getting postponed for multiple hearings - sometimes to the next day, sometimes two to three weeks away. So it's a bit frustrating. I was hoping it would get quashed based on the merit of the case in a few weeks/months. And judges change every few months.      I'm writing this to understand a couple of things. My passport is coming up for renewal. I need to go to the nearest consulate for renewing it.       1) If I were to apply for the passport before the quash is granted, should I mention that I still have 'criminal proceedings' in the passport application?      2) Will the consulate officers always have access to the LOC record if I mention, or not mention, that I have criminal proceedings in the passport application?       3) Is there any place I can check if I have an LOC against me ? Is it the FRRO website?       4) If the quash proceedings were to still continue for two more months, should I apply to the HC for permission to renew the passport? (Just to note that, I am abroad, and have never appeared before trial court or HC, but cooperated only using my lawyer and now the quash is admitted in HC, and I don't have AB)      Thanks",

Nandi (1979) 1 SCC 361, Supreme Court observed thus: \"It stems out of the fundamental principle of our criminal jurisprudence that the accused is entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt. If two reasonably probable and evenly balanced views of the evidence are possible, one must necessarily concede the existence of a reasonable doubt. But, fanciful and remote possibilities must be left out of account. To entitle an accused person to the benefit of a doubt arising from the possibility of a duality of views, the possible view in favour of the accused must be as nearly reasonably probable as that against him. If the preponderance of probability is all one way, a bare possibility of another view will not entitle the accused to claim the benefit of any doubt. It is, therefore, essential that any view of the evidence in favour of the accused must be reasonable even as any doubt, the benefit of which an accused person may claim, must be reasonable. \"A reasonable doubt\", it has been remarked, \"does not mean some light, airy, insubstantial doubt that may flit through the minds of any of us about almost anything at some time or other, it does not mean a doubt begotten by sympathy out of reluctance to convict; it means a real doubt, a doubt founded upon reasons.

Raveendran, Dalveer Bhandari  IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA  CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION  CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.155 OF 2006 Ghurey Lal ... Appellant  Versus State of U.P. ... Respondent  JUDGMENT Dalveer Bhandari, J. 1. This appeal is directed against the judgment of the High Court of Allahabad dated 11th November, 2005 passed in Criminal Appeal No. 365 of 1981. 2. This is a murder case in which the trial court acquitted the accused. The High Court reversed the trial court's decision, finding the accused guilty. In doing so, the appellate court failed to give proper weight to the views of the trial court as to credibility of witnesses, thereby ignoring the standards by which the appellate courts consider appeals against acquittals. 3. We have endeavoured to set out the guidelines for the appellate courts in dealing with appeals against acquittal. An overriding theme emanates from the law on appeals against acquittals. The appellate court is given wide powers to review the evidence to come to its own conclusions. But this power must be exercised with great care and caution. In order to ensure that the innocents are not punished, the appellate court should attach due weight to the lower court's acquittal because the presumption of innocence is further strengthened by the acquittal. The appellate court should, therefore, reverse an acquittal only when it has \"very substantial and compelling reasons.\" 4. In giving our reasons for reversing the appellate court's judgment and restoring that of the trial court, we provide a brief review of the facts, the reasoning of the trial and High Court as well as the standards by which appeals against acquittals are reviewed according to settled principles of criminal jurisprudence in our country. 5. Before turning to the facts that were before the trial court, we note that there is an interesting coincidence in this case. The names of both the accused and the deceased are Ghurey Lal. Therefore, to avoid confusion, we have referred to them as \"accused\" and \"deceased.\" 6. Brief facts, according to prosecution, which are necessary to dispose of this appeal are recapitulated as under:- It appears that at the heart of this matter lies a property dispute. The accused testified in favour of his great-grand daughter, Ram Devi. This testimony went against the deceased, creating enmity between the parties. 7. On 14.3.1979, the deceased, Shiv Charan P.W.1, Brij Raj Singh P.W.2, Yad Ram P.W.4, Nathi Lal (not examined) and Bishambhar (not examined) had taken the customary Gur (Jaggery) during the Holi festival. 8. On their way home, they happened to pass by the home of the accused. The accused was standing just outside his home and was holding a shot gun. The accused began to verbally abuse the deceased. Thereafter, the accused fired one single shot from his gun, killing the deceased with a bullet and causing injuries to Brij Raj Singh P.W. 2 with pellets. Hearing the gun shot, some people quickly assembled at the scene. The accused fled to his room, which he locked from inside. The uncle of the deceased, Shiv Charan, lodged the FIR that very evening, the 14th March, 1979 at 6.15 p.m., at the Barhan Police Station in the District of Agra. 9. The accused provided his own version of the event. According to the statement of the accused under section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, he went to the place of Kanchan Singh where Gur (Jaggery) was being distributed. One Bal Mukand told the accused to leave the Gur distribution ceremony, as the deceased, Brij Raj Singh P.W. 2, Yad Ram P.W.4, Nathi Lal and Bishambhar had collected pharsa, lathis and kattas declaring that they will deal with him (accused) when he comes there. On hearing this, the accused returned to his home and grabbed his gun. The deceased and others then arrived at his home, brandishing weapons. The deceased carried a pharsa, Nathi Lal had a katta, Brij Raj Singh a knife and Yad Ram and Bishambhar possessed lathis. To threaten and check them, the accused aimed his gun at them. This was to no avail. The deceased and others struck at the accused, hitting his gun. Nathi Lal fired his katta, causing pellet injuries to Brij Raj Singh P.W.2. A scuffle ensued in which the deceased's group tried to snatch away his gun. In the scuffle, the gun was accidentally fired, killing the deceased. The accused sustained pharsa and lathi blows on the butt and barrel of the gun. Fearing for his life, the accused went to his room and locked the door from inside. 10. Brij Raj Singh P.W. 2 was sent to the Government Hospital, Barhan for medical examination. Dr. Govind Prasad P.W.3 found the following injuries on the person of Brij Raj Singh, P.W. 2: 1. Round lacerated wound 0.3 cm x 0.3 cm on right side back 10 cms away from mid line 9 cms below border of scapula. Margins burnt and inverted, and tattooing present in an area of 5 cms. No pellets palpable. Bleeding present. 2. Lacerated wound of exit 1.5 cm x 0.5 cm on right side back 0.8 cm away and lateral from injury no. 1. Skin burnt and tattooing present in the area of 5 cm x 5 cms. Merging of the wound inverted. No pellets palpable. 11. The Doctor opined that the injuries were caused by a firearm. He advised that x-rays be taken and that the injuries be kept in observation. In his opinion, the injuries were caused by a gun shot and were of fresh duration. In his opinion, the injuries could have been caused around 4 p.m. The doctor sent the memo Ex. Ka-4 on the same day, informing the case of Medico legal nature to the Barhan Police Station. 12. The autopsy on the deceased was conducted by Dr. Ram Kumar Gupta, P.W.5, Medical Officer, SNM Hospital, Firozabad, District Agra. It revealed the following ante-mortem injuries on the deceased: 1. Gun shot wound of entry 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm x through and through on right side neck 2 cm lateral to midline of neck front aspect. 2. Gun shot wound of exit 5 cm x 4 cm x through and through on right side back of neck 5 cm below right ear corresponding to injury no. 1 with margins averted. The Doctor opined that the cause of death was due to shock and hemorrhage as a result of ante-mortem injury. 13. The prosecution examined Shiv Charan P.W.1, Brij Raj Singh P.W.2 and Yad Ram P.W.4 as eye witnesses of the occurrence. Dr. Govind Prasad P.W.3, Medical Officer In- charge, who had medically examined Brij Raj Singh, proved the injury report Ext. Ka 3. Dr. Ram Kumar Gupta P.W. 5, who had conducted autopsy on the dead body of the deceased, was also examined. On internal examination, he found semi digested food material in the small intestine and there was faecal matter present in the large intestines. He prepared the post-mortem report Ex. Ka-5. In his opinion, the death of the deceased had taken place around 4 p.m. on 14.3.79 on account of the said injuries and shock. 14. The accused was charged with killing the deceased under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (For short, IPC) and with causing simple injuries to the injured under section 323 IPC. He was also charged with attempting to murder Brij Raj under section 307 IPC. The accused appellant denied the charges, pleaded not guilty and asked to be tried. 15. The crucial question which arose for consideration was whether the injuries caused to Brij Raj Singh P.W.2 could have been caused by the same shot that killed the deceased. If that was possible, the prosecution version became probable. But if the shot that killed the deceased and the shot that caused injuries to Brij Raj Singh were from different weapons, then the defence version was more probable. Shri B. Rai, Ballistic Expert, Forensic Science Laboratory, U.P. was called as court witness No.1. He was asked to explain the nature of the 12 bore cartridges and give an opinion, for which he wanted time to carry out experiments in the laboratory. The gun was given to him and he performed a test in his laboratory in the light of the statements of the eye-witnesses, medical report and site-plan. He submitted his report, Ex. C- Ka.1, wherein he clearly opined that injuries Nos. 1 and 2 of the deceased were possible by the gun Ex.3 of the accused and injuries Nos.1 and 2 of the injured Brij Raj Singh were possible by another fire. By \"fire\", it is clear from the record that the Ballistic Expert was referring to a \"firearm\". 16. Ultimately, we must answer the following question: Whether the prosecution story of a single shot causing injury to two persons, that is bullet injury to deceased and pellet injury to Brij Raj Singh, with the accused as the aggressor, stands sufficiently proved beyond reasonable doubt? 17. In order to decide whether a single shot was fired or in fact two different shots were fired, we must carefully examine the versions of the prosecution and the defence and the report of the Ballistic Expert. According to the trial court, the medical evidence coupled with the Ballistic Expert report revealed the existence of two fires from two weapons and as such was inconsistent with the prosecution story. The trial court further provided that it is difficult to separate falsehood from the truth, as some material aspects of the occurrence appeared to have been deliberately withheld. \"One has to separate the chaff from the grain and it is difficult to lay hand upon what part of the prosecution evidence is true and what part is untrue\". According to the accused, the trial court had taken a reasonable and possible view of the entire evidence on record. 18. The post-mortem report Ex. Ka-5, photo lash Ex. Ka-7 and the statement of Dr. Ram Kumar Gupta P.W.5 indicate that the wound of entry was on the right side of the neck 2 cm. lateral middle line on front aspect. The exit wound was on the right side back of neck 5 cm. below the right ear. This means that the bullet had entered from the front side of the neck from a distance of 2 cm. lateral to middle line, and it had come out from the back of the neck at a place 5 cm. below the right ear. In this way, the trial court reasoned that the barrel of the gun, when discharging, was slanting vertical. The mouth of the barrel was upward and its butt downward. The barrel and the butt were not horizontal to the ground at that time. 19. The trial court observed that injury no. 1 (wound of entry) on Brij Raj Singh P.W.2 was on the right side of his back 10 cm. away from the mid line, 9 cms. below the lower border of scapula. Injury no. 2 (wound of exit) was on the right side of his back 8 cm. away and lateral from injury no.1. This means that the exit wound was by the side of the entry wound at a distance of 8 cm. 20. The dictionary meaning of `lateral' is \"by the side\" and this means that the two injuries caused by pellets to Brij Raj Singh P.W.2 were horizontal and not vertical. The trial court opined that the single shot could not have caused vertical injury to one person and horizontal injury to another. It found it doubtful and not sufficiently proved that the same shot could have injured Brij Raj Singh and killed the deceased. 21. This conclusion is further fortified by the report of the Ballistic Expert Sri B. Rai court witness No.1. He has given a definite opinion after making actual experiments by firing shots. This was done from the distance at which the occurrence was said to have taken place. The eye-witnesses had testified to this distance. The Ballistic Expert opined that the injuries to Brij Raj Singh P.W.2 were from a different shot from the one that killed the deceased. 22. The relevant part of the evidence of the Ballistic Expert reads as under: \"2. Question- Whether bullet and Chharras both be used in 12 bore gun or not? Ans.- 12 bore gun have no bullet. It has small chharas, big chharas or one single ball shot with diameter about 0645.\" 23. The Ballistic Expert after studying the post-mortem report observed as under: \"Studying the Post Mortem report No. 51/79 of deceased Ghurey Lal and injury report of Brijraj Singh dated 14.3.79, statement of doctor and witnesses and site plan and keeping the result of above experiments in mind, I reached in conclusion that injury No. 1 and 2 possible to sustain to deceased Ghurey Lal by this gun from the distance of 10 feet and injury No. 1 and 2 of injured Brij Raj Singh seems to sustain by some other shot.\" 24. The Ballistic Expert categorically stated that in cartridges of standard 12 bore shot guns, bullets from other rifles cannot be used with small and big chharas (pellets). Therefore, the trial court concluded that both the injuries were not possible by a single firearm. 25. Leading experts of forensic science, particularly ballistic experts, do not indicate that from a single cartridge both bullets and pellets can be fired. Professor Apurba Nandy in his book \"Principles of Forensic Medicine\", first published in 1995 and reprinted in 2001, discussed cartridges. Professor Nandy mentioned that in some cases, instead of multiple pellets, a single shot or metallic ball, usually made of lead, is used. We note that the discussion regarding cartridges exclusively mentions pellets. No mention of bullets and pellets in cartridges is found in the numerous volumes of scholarly literature that we have consulted. Relevant discussion reads as under: p. 241 \"The Cartridges (the ammunitions)- The cartridge of a shotgun and the cartridge of a rifled weapon are essentially different in their makes. The cartridge of a shot gun - (Fig. 10.69) The cartridge of a shotgun has the following parts and contents- 1. The cartridge case - The longer anterior part of the cartridge case is made of card board. The posterior part and the posterior surface is made of brass. The margin of the breach end of the cartridge case is rimmed, so that, the cartridge can be properly placed inside the chamber and with pressure on the rim the empty cartridge case can be easily ejected out of the chamber. The anterior margin of the cartridge case is twisted inward to keep the pellets and other materials inside the case compact. The anterior part of the cartridge case is made of cardboard, for which, with production of gas inside the cartridge case it can slightly expand so that, the twisted grip by the anterior margin will be released and the pellets can come out of the case. The posterior metallic part keeps the shape of the breach end of the cartridge intact. It helps to maintain the right position of the cartridge in the chamber, so that, the percussion pin of the hammer strikes the percussion cap rightly at the breach surface of the cartridge. At the central part at the breach end inside the cartridge case is the percussion cap. 2. The percussion cap - It contains primer or priming mixture and there are some vents or openings on the wall of the percussion cap. When the posterior surface of the percussion cap is struck by the percussion pin, the priming mixture which consists of a mixture either of mercury fulminate, pot, pot, chlorate and antimony sulphide or of antimony sulphide with lead styphnate, lead peroxide, barium nitrate or tetracene, gets ignited due to the pressure and friction and fire comes out through the vents or openings on the wall of the percussion cap. 3. Contents inside the cartridge case. Surrounding the percussion cap is the gun powder or the propellant charge which cannot ignite by pressure or friction and which on being ignited does not produce flame but produces huge amount of gas. Usually the gunpowder of the shotguns contains charcoal, pot, nitrate and sulphur. This combination of the gunpowder is known as black powder, as it produce much smoke. Now-a-days semi smokeless gun powder is in use in shot guns which is a combination of 80% of black powder and 20% of smokeless powder. Smokeless powder is ordinarily used in the cartridges of rifles (nitrocellulose or a combination of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine). The black powder produces 200 - 300 ml. of gas per grain. In front of the gunpowder, inside the cartridge case, there is a thin cardboard disc. In front of the cardboard, disc is placed the wad. The wad is made of soft substance like, felt, cork, straw or rug. In front of the wad, there is another card board disc. In front of this disc, the pellets are placed. The pellets are spherical projectiles used in shot guns. Their size may be variable, according to the need and make. One ounce of pellets may consist of 6 to 2,600 of them. In front of the pellets there is another cardboard disc on the anterior margin of which the anterior margin of the cartridge case is twisted. The functions of the wad are to give compactness to the gunpowder, to prevent admixture of propellant charge and the pellets and prevent leakage of the gas produced after the firing. Wad also cleans the inner surface of the barrel after the pellets pass out through the barrel. To facilitate this cleaning, some greasy material is soaked in the wad. In between the propellant charge and the wad there is a cardboard disc so that the greasy substance in the wad will not be soaked by the propellant charge and become useless. In between the wad and the pellets there is a disc which in one hand prevents impregnation of the pellets in the soft wad and on the other, prevents leakage of the greasy substance from the wad in the pellets which would otherwise become adhesive to each other loosing their dispersion capacity. The anterior - most disc, placed in front of the pellets, give compactness to the pellets and the whole content of the cartridge case. Shots of different sizes are suitable for different purposes. Accordingly \"Buck shots\" or \"Bird shots\" have different sized shots or pellets for hunting wild birds or other prey. In some cases instead of multiple pellets a single hot or metallic ball, usually made up of lead, is used. \"Rifled slugs\" are single shot projectiles for shot guns with prominent parallel grooves on the surface.\" 26. In this book, the assessment of the direction of firing from the margin of the wound of entrance has also been given, which reads thus: p. 257 \"Assessment of the direction of firing from the margin of the wound of entrance - (i) (a) In case of shotgun injury, the pattern of dispersion of the pellets give the direction of the firing. The pellets disperse over wider area as it travels more. Hence firing is suspected to have been from the side opposite to the side of wider dispersion of the pellets. ......\" 27. \"Firearms in Criminal Investigation and Trials\" was written by a distinguished professor Dr. B.R. Sharma. He has written in some detail about 12 bore guns. This book also defines Pellet Pattern which reads thus: p.204 \"Pellet Pattern The area covered (pellet spread) by the pellets fired from a shotgun is proportional to the distance between the muzzle of the firearm and the target. Greater the range, greater is the area covered by the pellets. The spread of the pellets is affected mainly by the length of the barrel of the firearm and its muzzle characteristics (whether it is choked or not). The condition of the ammunition also affects the results. If experiments are performed with the same firearm and ammunition of the same make and batch, the test patterns provide fairly accurate estimates of the range. Generally, the whole charge enters the body en masse up to a range of about two metres in a factory-made 12-bore shotgun. It forms a rat-hole of about two to six centimetres in diameter. The rat-hole is surrounded by individual holes when the range of fire is about two to seven metres...\" 28. The trial court stated that in the FIR itself it is mentioned that the injuries to Brij Raj Singh were by pellets and that of the deceased by a bullet. The Ballistic Expert has stated that the cartridge containing pellets cannot contain a bullet. Accordingly, the trial court reasoned that two weapons were used. 29. The Ballistic Expert is a disinterested, independent witness who has technical knowledge and experience. It follows that the trial judge was fully justified in placing reliance on his report. 30. The trial court also observed that removing the body of the deceased from the place of occurrence creates doubt that the prosecution was planning to substitute another story for the real facts. As such, the possibility that the deceased and his group were the aggressors is not ruled out. It is possible that pharsa and lathi blows had made the marks that were found on the gun. The gun may have snatched all of a sudden, causing it to fire upon the deceased and Brij Raj. Under the circumstances of the case, the use of another weapon, which had caused injuries to Brij Raj Singh P.W.2, is also not ruled out. 31. The trial court further observed that the substratum of the prosecution story about the injuries to Brij Raj Singh is not established beyond reasonable doubt and the story of shooting the deceased by the same shot fired by the accused is not separable from other doubtful evidence of eye- witnesses. The circumstances show that the possibility of aggression on the part of the complainant side is not ruled out, then the benefit of doubt for killing the deceased by the accused would also go to the accused. 32. The trial court also found force in the plea of right of private defence as set up by the accused. The trial court mentioned that there is force in this argument where the circumstances of the case show that two fire arms were used in the occurrence. The accused was all alone in his house at that time. The availability of a second weapon is possible only when the complainant side had brought it to the scene. This circumstance supports the defence case, that the complainants' side was the aggressor and they had come armed with weapons to the scene. It follows that the accused would apprehend grievous hurt and danger to his life. Accordingly, the right of self defence was open to him. 33. In the concluding paragraph of the judgment, the trial court observed that when neither the prosecution nor the defence version is complete, then it is obvious that both the parties are withholding some information from the court. The burden of proving the charge to the hilt lies upon the prosecution. It has failed to discharge its burden. Thus, the benefit has to go to the accused. According to the trial court, the accused could not be convicted for the charges framed against him. He was entitled to get the benefit of doubt and, consequently, the accused had to be acquitted of the charges under sections 302, 307 and 323 IPC. 34. The State, aggrieved by the trial court's judgment, preferred an appeal before the High Court. 35. The High Court in appeal re-appreciated the entire evidence and came to the conclusion that the trial court's judgment was perverse and unsustainable. It therefore set aside the trial court judgment and convicted the accused under section 302 IPC for the murder of the deceased and under section 324 IPC for injuring Brij Raj Singh and sentenced him to life imprisonment and for six months R.I. respectively. 36. Against the impugned judgment of the High Court, the accused appellant has preferred appeal to this court. We have been called upon to decide whether the trial court judgment was perverse and the High Court was justified in setting aside the same or whether the impugned judgment is unsustainable and against the settled legal position? 37. We deem it appropriate to deal with the main reasons by which the trial court was compelled to pass the order of acquittal and the main reasons of the High Court in reversing the judgment of the trial court. MAIN REASONS FOR ACQUITTAL BY THE TRIAL COURT: 38. The trial court acquitted the accused for the following reasons: 1. The prosecution story of single shot injury to two persons one standing horizontally and the other vertically stands totally discredited by the medical and the evidence of Ballistic Expert. 2. According to the FIR, the deceased received a spherical ball (ball shot) bullet injury and Brij Raj Singh P.W.2 received pellet injuries. The accused's gun had a cartridge that could only contain pellets. The Ballistic Expert has clearly stated that a cartridge containing pellets cannot contain a bullet. As such, it appears that two weapons were used. 3. Dr. Ram Kumar Gupta, P.W.5 who conducted the post-mortem of the deceased, clearly stated that the deceased received injuries from a bullet whereas Dr. Govind Prasad Bakara who had examined Brijraj Singh P.W.2 clearly stated that both injuries were caused by a pellet. Therefore, according to medical evidence coupled with the evidence of the Ballistic Expert, two firearms must have been used. This version is quite inconsistent with the prosecution story. 4. The injuries received by Brij Raj Singh P.W.2 were from the back side and the injury received by the deceased was from the front side and this shows that two weapons may have been used. 5. Removal of the body of the deceased from the place of occurrence also created doubt with regard to the veracity of the prosecution version. 6. The possibility that the deceased and the complainant's side were aggressors and had gone there and caused pharsa and lathi blows on the accused cannot be ruled out because of the marks on the gun Ex.3. That the said gun was fired in snatching all of a sudden, injuring the deceased also cannot be ruled out from the circumstances of the case. 7. The trial court did not discard the defence version of right of private defence as pleaded by the accused. 8. The trial court observed that it is difficult to separate falsehood from the truth, where some material aspects of the occurrence seem to have been deliberately withheld. It is a well- established principle of criminal jurisprudence that when two possible and plausible explanations co-exist, the explanation favourable to the accused should be adopted. MAIN REASONS FOR REVERSAL OF ACQUITTAL ORDER: 39. The High Court gave the following reasons for setting aside the acquittal: 1. A perusal of the post-mortem report goes to show that autopsy conducted on the dead body of the deceased revealed ante- mortem gunshot wound of entry 2.5 cm x through and through on right side neck 2 cm lateral to midline of neck front aspect having corresponding wound of exit 5 cm x 4 cm on right side back of neck 5 cm below right ear. Therefore, this injury was almost horizontal. 2. Medical examination of injured Brij Raj Singh revealed a round lacerated wound of entry 0.3 cm x 0.5 cm on right side back 10 cm away from midline and 9 cm below lower border of scapula having wound of exit 1.5 cm x 0.5 cm x 0.5 on right side back 0.8 cm away and lateral from injury no. 1. Thus, this injury was also almost horizontal. 3. The observation made by the trial judge that firearm injury caused to the deceased was vertical and to that of Brij Raj Singh horizontal is wholly fallacious. 4. A layman does not understand the  distinction between a cartridge  containing pellets and the bullet. In common parlance, particularly in villages when a person sustains injuries by gun shot, it is said that he has received `goli' injury. Ghurey Lal fired at his uncle with his gun causing him Goli (bullet) injury and Brij Raj Singh also received pellet (chhara) injury which goes to show that injuries received by them were caused by two different weapons. There is hardly any difference between bullet and pellet for a layman. From 12 bore gun cartridge is fired and 12 bore cartridge always contain pellets though size of pellets may be different. 5. A perusal of the post-mortem reports goes to show that autopsy conducted on the dead body of the deceased revealed ante- mortem gun shot wound of entry 2.5 cms. through and through on right side neck 2 cm lateral to midline of neck front aspect having corresponding wound of exit 5 cm x 4cm on right side back of neck 5 cm below right ear. Therefore, this injury was almost horizontal. 6. The medical examination of injured Brij Raj Singh revealed a round lacerated wound of entry 0.3 cm x 0.5 cm on right side back 10 cm away from midline and 9 cm below lower border of scapula having wound of exit 1.5 cm x 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm on right side back 0.8 cm away and lateral from injury no.1. Thus, this injury was also almost horizontal. 7. The learned trial judge had noted the evidence of B. Rai, Ballistic Expert, C.W.1 that both the injuries would have been caused by two shots. While B. Rai, Ballistic Expert, C.W.1 had given the said opinion, he had also stated in his cross- examination by the prosecution that if the assailant fired from place `C' and the person receiving pellet injury standing at place `B' would have turned around, on dispersal of pellets he could have received the pellet injuries if deceased and injured both would have stood in the same line of firing. OUR CONCLUSIONS: 40. We disagree with the High Court. Admittedly, the deceased died of a bullet injury whereas Brij Raj Singh, P.W. 2 received pellet injuries. It is well settled that a cartridge cannot contain pellet and bullet shots together. Therefore, the injuries on deceased and injured P.W. 2 clearly establish that two shots were fired from two different fire arms. 41. The High Court also observed that the laymen, meaning thereby the villagers, hardly know the difference between a bullet and a pellet. This finding has no basis, particularly in view of the statement of all the witnesses on record. Wherever the witnesses wanted to use `bullet' they have clearly used `Goli' or `bullet' and wherever they wanted to use `pellet' they have clearly used the word `Chharra' which means pellets, so to say that the witnesses did not understand the distinction between the two is without any basis or foundation. 42. Mr. Sushil Kumar, learned senior advocate appearing for the appellant, submitted that the judgment of the trial court was based on the correct evaluation of the evidence and the view taken by the trial court was definitely a reasonable and plausible. Therefore, according to the settled legal position, the High Court was not justified in interfering with the judgment of the trial court. 43. Shri Ratnakar Das, learned senior advocate appearing for the respondent State submitted that the impugned order of the High Court is consistent with the settled legal position. He submitted that once an order of acquittal is challenged then the appellate court has all the powers which are exercised by the trial court. We agree that the appellate court is fully empowered to re-appreciate and re-evaluate the entire evidence on record. 44. We deem it appropriate to deal with some of the important cases which have been dealt with under the 1898 Code by the Privy Council and by this Court. We would like to crystallize the legal position in the hope that the appellate courts do not commit similar lapses upon dealing with future judgments of acquittal. 45. The earliest case that dealt with the controversy in issue was Sheo Swarup v. King Emperor AIR 1934 Privy Council 227. In this case, the ambit and scope of the powers of the appellate court in dealing with an appeal against acquittal has been aptly elucidated by the Privy Council. Lord Russell writing the judgment has observed as under: (at p. 230): \"..the High Court should and will always give proper weight and consideration to such matters as (1) the views of the trial Judge as to the credibility of the witnesses, (2) the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused, a presumption certainly not weakened by the fact that he has been acquitted at his trial, (3) the right of the accused to the benefit of any doubt, and (4) the slowness of an appellate court in disturbing a finding of fact arrived at by a Judge who had the advantage of seeing the witnesses..\" The law succinctly crystallized in this case has been consistently followed by this Court. On proper analysis of the ratio and findings of this case, it is revealed that the findings of the trial court are based on the fundamental principles of the criminal jurisprudence. Presumption of innocence in favour of the accused further gets reinforced and strengthened by the acquittal of the trial court. The appellate court undoubtedly has wide powers of re-appreciating and re- evaluating the entire evidence but it would be justified in interfering with the judgment of acquittal only when the judgment of the trial court is palpably wrong, totally ill- founded or wholly misconceived, based on erroneous analysis of evidence and non-existent material, demonstrably unsustainable or perverse. 46. This Court again in the case of Surajpal Singh & Others v. State, AIR 1952 SC 52, has spelt out the powers of the High Court. The Court has also cautioned the Appellate Courts to follow well established norms while dealing with appeals from acquittal by the trial court. The Court observed as under: \"It is well established that in an appeal under S. 417 Criminal P.C., the High Court has full power to review the evidence upon which the order of acquittal was founded, but it is equally well-settled that the presumption of innocence of the accused was further reinforced by his acquittal by the trial court, and the findings of the trial court which had the advantage of seeing the witnesses and hearing their evidence can be reversed only for very substantial and compelling reasons.\" 47. This Court reiterated the principles and observed that presumption of innocence of accused is reinforced by an order of the acquittal. The appellate court could have interfered only for very substantial and compelling reasons. 48. In Tulsiram Kanu v. The State, AIR 1954 SC 1, this Court explicated that the appellate court would be justified in reversing the acquittal only when very substantial question and compelling reasons are present. In this case, the Court used a different phrase to describe the approach of an appellate court against an order of acquittal. There, the Sessions Court expressed that there was clearly reasonable doubt in respect of the guilt of the accused on the evidence put before it. Kania, C.J., observed that it required good and sufficiently cogent reasons to overcome such reasonable doubt before the appellate court came to a different conclusion. 49. In the same year, this Court had an occasion to deal with Madan Mohan Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1954 SC 637, wherein it said that the High Court had not kept the rules and principles of administration of criminal justice clearly before it and that therefore the judgment was vitiated by non-advertence to and mis-appreciation of various material facts transpiring in evidence. The High Court failed to give due weight and consideration to the findings upon which the trial court based its decision. 50. The same principle has been followed in Atley v. State of U.P. AIR 1955 SC 807 (at pp. 809-10 para 5), wherein the Court said: \"It has been laid down by this Court that it is open to the High Court on an appeal against an order of acquittal to review the entire evidence and to come to its own conclusion, of course, keeping in view the well established rule that the presumption of innocence of the accused is not weakened but strengthened by the judgment of acquittal passed by the trial court which had the advantage of observing the demeanour of witnesses whose evidence have been recorded in its presence. It is also well settled that the court of appeal has as wide powers of appreciation of evidence in an appeal against an order of acquittal as in the case of an appeal against an order of conviction, subject to the riders that the presumption of innocence with which the accused person starts in the trial court continues even up to the appellate stage and that the appellate court should attach due weight to the opinion of the trial court which recorded the order of acquittal.\" 51. The question was again raised prominently in Aher Raja Khima v. State of Saurashtra AIR 1956 SC 217. Bose, J. expressing the majority view observed (at p.220): \"It is, in our opinion, well settled that it is not enough for the High Court to take a different view of the evidence; there must also be substantial and compelling reasons for holding that the trial court was wrong; Ajmer Singh v. State of Punjab (AIR 1953 SC 76, at pp.77-78); and if the trial Court takes a reasonable view of the facts of the case, interference under S. 417 is not justifiable unless there are really strong reasons for reversing that view. Surajpal Singh v. State AIR 1952 SC 52 at 54.\" 52. In Balbir Singh v. State of Punjab AIR 1957 SC 216, this Court again had an occasion to examine the same proposition of law. The Court (at page 222) observed as under: \"It is now well settled that though the High Court has full power to review the evidence upon which an order of acquittal is founded, it is equally well settled that the presumption of innocence of the accused person is further reinforced by his acquittal by the trial Court and the views of the trial Judge as to the credibility of the witnesses must be given proper weight and consideration; and the slowness of an appellate Court in disturbing a finding of fact arrived at by a Judge who had the advantage of seeing the witnesses must also be kept in mind, and there must be substantial and compelling reasons for the appellate Court to come to a conclusion different from that of the trial Judge.\" 53. A Constitution Bench of this Court in M.G. Agarwal v. State of Maharashtra AIR 1963 SC 200, observed as under: \"There is no doubt that the power conferred by clause (a) which deals with an appeal against an order of acquittal is as wide as the power conferred by clause (b) which deals with an appeal against an order of conviction, and so, it is obvious that the High Court's powers in dealing with criminal appeals are equally wide whether the appeal in question is one against acquittal or against conviction. That is one aspect of the question. The other aspect of the question centres round the approach which the High Court adopts in dealing with appeals against orders of acquittal. In dealing with such appeals, the High Court naturally bears in mind the presumption of innocence in favour of an accused person and cannot lose sight of the fact that the said presumption is strengthened by the order of acquittal passed in his favour by the trial Court and so, the fact that the accused person is entitled for the benefit of a reasonable doubt will always be present in the mind of the High Court when it deals with the merits of the case. As an appellate Court the High Court is generally slow in disturbing the finding of fact recorded by the trial Court, particularly when the said finding is based on an appreciation of oral evidence because the trial Court has the advantage of watching the demeanour of the witnesses who have given evidence. Thus, though the powers of the High Court in dealing with an appeal against acquittal are as wide as those which it has in dealing with an appeal against conviction, in dealing with the former class of appeals, its approach is governed by the overriding consideration flowing from the presumption of innocence. ........ The test suggested by the expression \"substantial and compelling reasons\" should not be construed as a formula which has to be rigidly applied in every case, and so, it is not necessary that before reversing a judgment of acquittal, the High Court must necessarily characterize the findings recorded therein as perverse. The question which the Supreme Court has to ask itself, in appeals against conviction by the High Court in such a case, is whether on the material produced by the prosecution, the High Court was justified in reaching the conclusion that the prosecution case against the appellants had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the contrary view taken by the trial Court was erroneous. In answering this question, the Supreme Court would, no doubt, consider the salient and broad features of the evidence in order to appreciate the grievance made by the appellants against the conclusions of the High Court.\" 54. In Noor Khan v. State of Rajasthan, AIR 1964 SC 286, this Court relied on the principles of law enunciated by the Privy Council in Sheo Swarup (supra) and observed thus: \"Sections 417, 418 and 423 give to the High Court full power to review at large the evidence upon which the order of acquittal was founded, and to reach the conclusion that upon that evidence the order of acquittal should be reversed. But in exercising the power conferred by the Code and before reaching its conclusions upon fact, the High Court should and will always give proper weight and consideration to such matters as (1) the views of the trial Judge as to the credibility of the witnesses; (2) the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused, a presumption not weakened by the fact that he has been acquitted at his trial; (3) the right of the accused to the benefit of any doubt; and (4) the slowness of an appellate Court in disturbing a finding of fact arrived at by a Judge who had the advantage of seeing the witnesses.\" 55. In Khedu Mohton & Others v. State of Bihar, (1970) 2 SCC 450, this Court gave the appellate court broad guidelines as to when it could properly disturb an acquittal. The Court observed as under: \"3. It is true that the powers of the High Court in considering the evidence on record in appeals under Section 417, Cr. P.C. are as extensive as its powers in appeals against convictions but that court at the same time should bear in mind the presumption of- innocence of accused persons which presumption is not weakened by their acquittal. It must also bear in mind the fact that the appellate judge had found them not guilty. Unless the conclusions reached by him are palpably wrong or based on erroneous view of the law or that his decision is likely to result in grave injustice, the High Court should be reluctant to interfere with his conclusions. If two reasonable conclusions can be reached on the basis of the evidence on record then the view in support of the acquittal of the accused should be preferred. The fact that the High Court is inclined to take a different view of the evidence on record is not sufficient to interfere with the order of acquittal.\" (emphasis supplied) 56. In Shivaji Sahabrao Bobade & Another v. State of Maharashtra, (1973) 2 SCC 793, the Court observed thus: \"An appellant aggrieved by the overturning of his acquittal deserves the final court's deeper concern on fundamental principles of criminal justice...... ........ But we hasten to add even here that, although the learned judges of the High Court have not expressly stated so, they have been at pains to dwell at length on all the points relied on by the trial court as favourable to the prisoners for the good reason that they wanted to be satisfied in their conscience whether there was credible testimony warranting, on a fair consideration, a reversal of the acquittal registered by the court below. In law there are no fetters on the plenary power of the Appellate Court to review the whole evidence on which the order of acquittal is founded and, indeed, it has a duty to scrutinise the probative material de novo, informed, however, by the weighty thought that the rebuttable innocence attributed to the accused having been converted into an acquittal the homage our jurisprudence owes to individual liberty constrains the higher court not to upset the holding without very convincing reasons and comprehensive consideration, In our view the High Court's judgment survives this exacting standard.\" 57. In Lekha Yadav v. State of Bihar (1973) 2 SCC 424, the Court following the case of Sheo Swarup (supra) again reiterated the legal position as under: \"The different phraseology used in the judgments of this Court such as- (a) substantial and compelling reasons: (b) good and sufficiently cogent reasons; (c) strong reasons. are not intended to curtail the undoubted power of an appellate court in an appeal against acquittal to review the entire evidence and to come to its own conclusion, but in doing so it should not only consider every matter on record having a bearing on the questions of fact and the reasons given by the court below in support of its order of acquittal but should express the reasons in its judgment which led it to hold that the acquittal was not justified.\" 58. In Khem Karan & Others v. State of U.P. & Another AIR 1974 SC 1567, this Court observed: \"Neither mere possibilities nor remote possibilities nor mere doubts which are not reasonable can, without danger to the administration of justice, be the foundation of the acquittal of an accused person, if there is otherwise fairly credible testimony.\" 59. In Bishan Singh & Others v. The State of Punjab (1974) 3 SCC 288, Justice Khanna speaking for the Court provided the legal position: \"22. It is well settled that the High Court in appeal under Section 417 of the CrPC has full power to review at large the evidence on which the order of acquittal was founded and to reach the conclusion that upon the evidence the order of acquittal should be reversed. No limitation should be placed upon that power unless is be found expressly stated be in the Code, but in exercising the power conferred by the Code and before reaching its conclusion upon fact the High Court should give proper weight and consideration to such matters as (1) the views of the trial judge as to the credibility of the witnesses; (2) the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused, a presumption certainly not weakened by the fact that he has been acquitted at his trial; (3) the right of the accused to the benefit of any doubt; & (4) the slowness of an appellate court in disturbing a finding of fact arrived at by a judge who had the advantage of seeing the witnesses.\" 60. In Umedbhai Jadavbhai v. The State of Gujarat (1978) 1 SCC 228, the Court observed thus: \"In an appeal against acquittal, the High Court would not ordinarily interfere with the Trial Court's conclusion unless there are compelling reasons to do so inter alia on account of manifest errors of law or of fact resulting in miscarriage of justice.\" 61. In B.N. Mutto & Another v. Dr. T.K. Nandi (1979) 1 SCC 361, the Court observed thus: \"It stems out of the fundamental principle of our criminal jurisprudence that the accused is entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt. If two reasonably probable and evenly balanced views of the evidence are possible, one must necessarily concede the existence of a reasonable doubt. But, fanciful and remote possibilities must be left out of account. To entitle an accused person to the benefit of a doubt arising from the possibility of a duality of views, the possible view in favour of the accused must be as nearly reasonably probable as that against him. If the preponderance of probability is all one way, a bare possibility of another view will not entitle the accused to claim the benefit of any doubt. It is, therefore, essential that any view of the evidence in favour of the accused must be reasonable even as any doubt, the benefit of which an accused person may claim, must be reasonable. \"A reasonable doubt\", it has been remarked, \"does not mean some light, airy, insubstantial doubt that may flit through the minds of any of us about almost anything at some time or other, it does not mean a doubt begotten by sympathy out of reluctance to convict; it means a real doubt, a doubt founded upon reasons. [Salmond J. in his charge to the jury in R.V. Fantle reported in 1959 Criminal Law Review 584.]\" {emphasis supplied} 62. In Tota Singh & Another v. State of Punjab (1987) 2 SCC 529, the Court reiterated the same principle in the following words: \"This Court has repeatedly pointed out that the mere fact that the appellate court is inclined on a re-appreciation of the evidence to reach a conclusion which is at variance with the one recorded in the order of acquittal passed by the court below will not constitute a valid and sufficient ground for setting aside the acquittal. The jurisdiction of the appellate court in dealing with an appeal against an order of acquittal is circumscribed by the limitation that no interference is to be made with the order of acquittal unless the approach made by the lower court to the consideration of the evidence in the case is vitiated by some manifest illegality or the conclusion recorded by the court below is such which could not have been possibly arrived at by any court acting reasonably and judiciously and is, therefore, liable to be characterised as perverse. Where two views are possible on an appraisal of the evidence adduced in the case and the court below has taken a view which is a plausible one, the appellate court cannot legally interfere with an order of acquittal even if it is of the opinion that the view taken by the court below on its consideration of the evidence is erroneous.\" (emphasis supplied) 63. In Ram Kumar v. State of Haryana 1995 Supp. (1) SCC 248, this Court had another occasion to deal with a case where the court dealt with the powers of the High Court in appeal from acquittal. The Court observed as under: \".. the High Court should not have interfered with the order of acquittal merely because another view on an appraisal of the evidence on record was possible. In this connection it may be pointed out that the powers of the High Court in an appeal from order of acquittal to reassess the evidence and reach its own conclusions under Sections 378 and 379 (sic 386) CrPC are as extensive as in any appeal against the order of conviction. But as a rule of prudence, it is desirable that the High Court should give proper weight and consideration to the view of the trial court with regard to the credibility of the witness, the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused, the right of accused to the benefit of any doubt and the slowness of appellate court in justifying a finding of fact arrived at by a judge who had the advantage of of seeing the witness. No doubt it is settled law that if the main grounds on which the Court below has based its order acquitting the accused, are reasonable and plausible, and the same cannot entirely and effectively be dislodged or demolished, the High Court should not disturb the order of acquittal. We shall, therefore, examine the evidence and the material on record to see whether the conclusions recorded by the Trial Court in acquitting the appellant are reasonable and plausible or the same are vitiated by some manifest illegality or the conclusion recorded by the Trial Court are such which could not have been possibly arrived at by any Court acting reasonably and judiciously which may in other words be characterized as perverse.\" 64. This Court time and again has provided direction as to when the High Courts should interfere with an acquittal. In Madan Lal v. State of J&K, (1997) 7 SCC 677, the Court observed as under: \"8. ........ that there must be \"sufficient and compelling reasons\" or \"good and sufficiently cogent reasons\" for the appellate court to alter an order of acquittal to one of conviction........\" 65. In Sambasivan & Others v. State of Kerala (1998) 5 SCC 412, while relying on the case of Ramesh Babulal Doshi (Supra), the Court observed thus: 7. The principles with regard to the scope of the powers of the appellate court in an appeal against acquittal, are well settled. The powers of the appellate court in an appeal against acquittal are no less than in an appeal against conviction. But where on the basis of evidence on record two views are reasonably possible the appellate court cannot substitute its view in the place of that of the trial court. It is only when the approach of the trial court in acquitting an accused is found to be clearly erroneous in its consideration of evidence on record and in deducing conclusions therefrom that the appellate court can interfere with the order of acquittal.\" 66. In Bhagwan Singh & Others v. State of M.P. (2002) 4 SCC 85, the Court repeated one of the fundamental principles of criminal jurisprudence that if two views are possible on the evidence adduced in the case, one pointing to the guilt of the accused and the other to his innocence, the view which is favourable to the accused should be adopted. The Court observed as under:- \"7. The golden thread which runs through the web of administration of justice in criminal case is that if two views are possible on the evidence adduced in the case, one pointing to the guilt of the accused and the other to his innocence, the view which is favourable to the accused should be adopted. Such is not a jurisdiction limitation on the appellate court but a Judge made guidelines for circumspection. The paramount consideration of the court is to ensure that miscarriage of justice is avoided.\" 67. In Harijana Thirupala & Others v. Public Prosecutor, High Court of A.P., Hyderabad (2002) 6 SCC 470, this Court again had an occasion to deal with the settled principles of law restated by several decisions of this Court. Despite a number of judgments, High Courts continue to fail to keep them in mind before reaching a conclusion. The Court observed thus: \"10. The principles to be kept in mind in our system of administration of criminal justice are stated and restated in several decisions of this Court. Yet, sometimes High Courts fail to keep them in mind before reaching a conclusion as to the guilt or otherwise of the accused in a given case. The case on hand is one such case. Hence it is felt necessary to remind about the well-settled principles again. It is desirable and useful to remind and keep in mind these principles in deciding a case. 11. In our administration of criminal justice an accused is presumed to be innocent unless such a presumption is rebutted by the prosecution by producing the evidence to show him to be guilty of the offence with which he is charged. Further if two views are possible on the evidence produced in the case, one indicating to the guilt of the accused and the other to his innocence, the view favourable to the accused is to be accepted. In cases where the court entertains reasonable doubt regarding the guilt of the accused the benefit of such doubt should go in favour of the accused. At the same time, the court must not reject the evidence of the prosecution taking it as false, untrustworthy or unreliable on fanciful grounds or on the basis of conjectures and surmises. The case of the prosecution must be judged as a whole having regard to the totality of the evidence. In appreciating the evidence the approach of the court must be integrated not truncated or isolated. In other words, the impact of the evidence in totality on the prosecution case or innocence of the accused has to be kept in mind in coming to the conclusion as to the guilt or otherwise of the accused. In reaching a conclusion about the guilt of the accused, the court has to appreciate, analyse and assess the evidence placed before it by the yardstick of probabilities, its intrinsic value and the animus of witnesses. It must be added that ultimately and finally the decision in every case depends upon the facts of each case. 12. Doubtless the High Court in appeal either against an order of acquittal or conviction as a court of first appeal has full power to review the evidence to reach its own independent conclusion. However, it will not interfere with an order of acquittal lightly or merely because one other view is possible, because with the passing of an order of acquittal presumption of innocence in favour of the accused gets reinforced and strengthened. The High Court would not be justified to interfere with the order of acquittal merely because it feels that sitting as a trial court it would have proceeded to record a conviction; a duty is cast on the High Court while reversing an order of acquittal to examine and discuss the reasons given by the trial court to acquit the accused and then to dispel those reasons. If the High Court fails to make such an exercise the judgment will suffer from serious infirmity.\" (emphasis supplied) 68. In C. Antony v. K.G. Raghavan Nair, (2003) 1 SCC 1 had to reiterate the legal position in cases where there has been acquittal by the trial courts. This Court observed thus: \"6. This Court in a number of cases has held that though the appellate court has full power to review the evidence upon which the order of acquittal is founded, still while exercising such an appellate power in a case of acquittal, the appellate court, should not only consider every matter on record having a bearing on the question of fact and the reasons given by the courts below in support of its order of acquittal, it must express its reasons in the judgment which led it to hold that the acquittal is not justified. In those line of cases this Court has also held that the appellate court must also bear in mind the fact that the trial court had the benefit of seeing the witnesses in the witness box and the presumption of innocence is not weakened by the order of acquittal, and in such cases if two reasonable conclusions can be reached on the basis of the evidence on record, the appellate court should not disturb the finding of the trial court.\" 69. In State of Karnataka v. K. Gopalkrishna, (2005) 9 SCC 291, while dealing with an appeal against acquittal, the Court observed: \"In such an appeal the Appellate Court does not lightly disturb the findings of fact recorded by the Court below. If on the basis of the same evidence, two views are reasonably possible, and the view favouring the accused is accepted by the Court below, that is sufficient for upholding the order of acquittal. However, if the Appellate Court comes to the conclusion that the findings of the Court below are wholly unreasonable or perverse and not based on the evidence on record, or suffers from serious illegality including ignorance or misreading of evidence on record, the Appellate Court will be justified in setting aside such an order of acquittal.\" 70. In The State of Goa v. Sanjay Thakran, (2007) 3 SCC 755, this Court relied on the judgment in State of Rajasthan v. Raja Ram (2003) 8 SCC 180 and observed as under: \"15. Generally, the order of acquittal shall not be interfered with because the presumption of innocence of the accused is further strengthened by acquittal. The golden thread which runs through the web of administration of justice in criminal cases is that if two views are possible on the evidence adduced in the case, one pointing to the guilt of the accused and the other to his innocence, the view which is favourable to the accused should be adopted. ... The principle to be followed by appellate court considering the appeal against the judgment of acquittal is to interfere only when there are compelling and substantial reasons for doing so. If the impugned judgment is clearly unreasonable, it is a compelling reason for interference.\" The Court further held as follows: \"16. it is apparent that while exercising the powers in appeal against the order of acquittal the court of appeal would not ordinarily interfere with the order of acquittal unless the approach of the lower court is vitiated by some manifest illegality and the conclusion arrived at would not be arrived at by any reasonable person and, therefore, the decision is to be characterized as perverse. Merely because two views are possible, the court of appeal would not take the view which would upset the judgment delivered by the court below.\" 71. In Chandrappa & Others v. State of Karnataka (2007) 4 SCC 415, this Court held: \"(1) An appellate court has full power to review, reappreciate and reconsider the evidence upon which the order of acquittal is founded. (2) The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 puts no limitation, restriction or condition on exercise of such power and an appellate court on the evidence before it may reach its own conclusion, both on questions of fact and of law. (3) Various expressions, such as, \"substantial and compelling reasons\", \"good and sufficient grounds\", \"very strong circumstances\", \"distorted conclusions\", \"glaring mistakes\", etc. are not intended to curtail extensive powers of an appellate court in an appeal against acquittal. Such phraseologies are more in the nature of \"flourishes of language\" to emphasise the reluctance of an appellate court to interfere with acquittal than to curtail the power of the court to review the evidence and to come to its own conclusion. (4) An appellate court, however, must bear in mind that in case of acquittal, there is double presumption in favour of the accused. Firstly, the presumption of innocence is available to him under the fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence that every person shall be presumed to be innocent unless he is proved guilty by a competent court of law. Secondly, the accused having secured his acquittal, the presumption of his innocence is further reinforced, reaffirmed and strengthened by the trial court. (5) If two reasonable conclusions are possible on the basis of the evidence on record, the appellate court should not disturb the finding of acquittal recorded by the trial court.\" 72. The following principles emerge from the cases above: 1. The appellate court may review the evidence in appeals against acquittal under sections 378 and 386 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973. Its power of reviewing evidence is wide and the appellate court can reappreciate the entire evidence on record. It can review the trial court's conclusion with respect to both facts and law. 2. The accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty. The accused possessed this presumption when he was before the trial court. The trial court's acquittal bolsters the presumption that he is innocent. 3. Due or proper weight and consideration must be given to the trial court's decision. This is especially true when a witness' credibility is at issue. It is not enough for the High Court to take a different view of the evidence. There must also be substantial and compelling reasons for holding that trial court was wrong. 73. In light of the above, the High Court and other appellate courts should follow the well settled principles crystallized by number of judgments if it is going to overrule or otherwise disturb the trial court's acquittal: 1. The appellate court may only overrule or otherwise disturb the trial court's acquittal if it has \"very substantial and compelling reasons\" for doing so. A number of instances arise in which the appellate court would have \"very substantial and compelling reasons\" to discard the trial court's decision. \"Very substantial and compelling reasons\" exist when: i) The trial court's conclusion with regard to the facts is palpably wrong; ii) The trial court's decision was based on an erroneous view of law; iii) The trial court's judgment is likely to result in \"grave miscarriage of justice\"; iv) The entire approach of the trial court in dealing with the evidence was patently illegal; v) The trial court's judgment was manifestly unjust and unreasonable; vi) The trial court has ignored the evidence or misread the material evidence or has ignored material documents like dying declarations/ report of the Ballistic expert, etc. vii) This list is intended to be illustrative, not exhaustive. 2. The Appellate Court must always give proper weight and consideration to the findings of the trial court. 3. If two reasonable views can be reached - one that leads to acquittal, the other to conviction - the High Courts/appellate courts must rule in favour of the accused. 74. Had the well settled principles been followed by the High Court, the accused would have been set free long ago. Though the appellate court's power is wide and extensive, it must be used with great care and caution. 75. We have considered the entire evidence and documents on record and the reasoning given by the trial court for acquitting the accused and also the reasoning of the High Court for reversal of the judgment of acquittal. We have also dealt with a number of cases decided by the Privy Council and this Court since 1934. In our considered opinion, the trial court carefully scrutinized the entire evidence and documents on record and arrived at the correct conclusion. We are clearly of the opinion that the reasoning given by the High Court for overturning the judgment of the trial court is wholly unsustainable and contrary to the settled principles of law crystallized by a series of judgment. 76. On marshalling the entire evidence and the documents on record, the view taken by the trial court is certainly a possible and plausible view. The settled legal position as explained above is that if the trial court's view is possible and plausible, the High Court should not substitute the same by its own possibl"

If from such a rebuttal, a reasonable doubt arises\tregarding his\tguilt, the accused should get\tthe benefit\tof the same.

In that way the benefit of a reasonable doubt which arises from the legal and factual considerations even under Section\t105 of the Evidence Act should necessarily go to the accused. It can be argued that the concept of 'reasonable doubt' is vague in nature and the standard of 'burden of proof' contemplated under Section/05 should be somewhat specific, therefore, it is difficult to reconcile both. But the gener- al principles of criminal jurisprudence, namely, that\tthe prosecution has to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and that the accused is entitled to the benefit of a reason- able doubt, are to be borne in mind.

HEADNOTE:  14 accused were tried for offences under section 148 and 302 read with Section 149 of I.P.C. for the murder of\t two persons named Mahendra Singh and Virendra Singh and injuries to 3 others named Vijay Narain Singh, P.W. 1,\tUma Shankar Singh, P.W. 2 and Kailash Singh. Accused No. 6 Chirkut Singh was further tried under Section 307 I.P.C. for attempting to murder\tP.W. 1 and all the remaining accused under section 307 read with Section 149 I.P.C. for causing injuries to Uma Shankar\t and Kailash Singh. The trial court relying on\t the evidence of P.Ws 1 and 2 who were the main eye witnesses convicted all the 14 accused under section 302 I.P.C.\tread with Section 149 I.P.C. and awarded them life imprisonment. The convicted accused preferred appeals to the\t High Court and the State filed appeals for enhancement of\t their\tsen- tence. A Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court consist- ing of Justice Katju and Aggarwal heard the appeals. While Justice\t Katju allowed the appeals by the accused and\tdis- missed the State appeals, Justice Aggarwal disagreeing\twith him, dismissed all the appeals, both by the accused and by the State. Consequently the matter was referred to a third judge.\tJustice Seth who confirmed the conviction and\tsen- tence awarded to accused Nos. 1, 3, 4 and 6 only and acquit- ted all the rest of the accused on the view taken by\t him that the specific overt acts were attributable to only these four accused and the rest should be given the benefit,of doubt.  Criminal Appeals Nos. 375-377 of 1987 by special leave were preferred by the convicted accused Nos. 1, 3, 4 and 6 and Criminal Appeals Nos. 372-374 of 1987 preferred by\t the State against the acquittal of other accused. Accepting\t the plea of the accused to the right of selfdefence but holding that they had definitely exceeded this right when they\twent to the\t extent of intentionally shooting the\tdeceased to death and therefore the offence committed was one punishable under section 574 304 Part I I.P.C. and not under Section 302 read with\tSec- tion 149 I.P.C. Accordingly in partly allowing the Appeals filed by the convicted accused and dismissing the State appeals, this Court,  HELD: A fact is said to be \"proved\" when, after consid- ering the matters before R, the Court either believes it to exist or considers its existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that it exists. [596G-H]  A fact is said to be 'disproved' when, after considering the matters before it, the Court either believes that it does not exist, or considers its non-existence so probable that a\t prudent man ought, under the circumstances of\t the particular case, to act upon the supposition that it\tdoes not exist. A fact is said to be \"not proved\"\twhen it is neither \"proved\" nor \"disproved\". [596H; 597A]  The\t maxim\tthat the prosecution must prove its\tcase beyond\treasonable doubt is a rule of caution laid down by the Courts of Law in respect of assessing the\tevidence in criminal cases. [601E]  Section 105 places \"burden of proof' on the accused in the first part and in the second part there is a presumption which the Court can draw regarding the absence of the\tcir- cumstances, which presumption is always rebuttable. Taking the section as a whole the \"burden of proof\" and the\tpre- sumption have\tto be considered together. It is exiomatic when the evidence is sufficient as to prove the existence of a fact conclusively then no difficulty arises. But where the accused\t introduces material to displace the\t presumption which may affect the prosecution,case or create a reasonable doubt about the existence of one or other ingredients of the offence and then it would amount to a case where prosecution failed\tto prove its own case beyond reasonable doubt. [601F-G]  The\t initial obligatory presumption regarding circum- stances gets lifted when a plea of exception is raised. More so when there are circumstances on the record, gathered from the prosecution evidence, chief and\tcross examinations, probabilities and circumstances, if any, introduced by\t the accused, either by adducing evidence or otherwise creating a reasonable doubt about the existence of the ingredients of the offence. In case of such a reasonable doubt, the Court has to give the benefit of the same to the accused. [601H; 602A]  The\t presumption regarding the absence of existence of circumstances regarding the exception can be rebutted by the accused by intro- 575 ducing evidence. If from such a rebuttal, a reasonable doubt arises\tregarding his\tguilt, the accused should get\t the benefit\t of the same. Such a reasonable\t doubt\tconsequently negatives one\tor more of the ingredients of\tthe offence charged, for instance, from such a rebuttal\tevidence, a reasonable doubt arises about the right of private defence then it follows that the prosecution has not established the necessary ingredients of intention to commit the offence. In that way the benefit of a reasonable doubt which arises from the legal and factual considerations even under Section\t 105 of the Evidence Act should necessarily go to the accused. [602C-E]  Section 3 is so worded as to provide for two conditions of mind, first, that in which a man feels absolutely certain of fact, in other words, \"believes it to exist\" and secondly in which though he may not feel absolutely certain of a fact, he thinks it so extremely probable that a prudent\t man would under the circumstances act on the assumption of\t its existence. [602G-H; 603A]  The\t Evidence Act while adopting the requirement of\t the prudent man as an appropriate concrete standard by which to measure\t proof at the same time contemplates of giving\tfull effect\tto be given to circumstances or condition of proba- bility\tor improbability. It is this degree of certainty to be arrived where the circumstances before a fact can be said to be proved. [603D]  The general burden of establishing the guilt of accused is always on the prosecution and it never shifts. Even in respect of the cases covered by Section 105 the\t prosecution is not absolved of its duty of discharging the burden.\t The accused may raise a plea of exception either by pleading the same specifically or by relying on the probabilities\t and circumstances obtaining in the case. [606F-G]  In the instant case, as per the evidence of the material witnesses, the two deceased were only proceeding alongwith the rasta towards the pump set for taking bath. Even in\t the plea set up by accused No. 6 it is not stated\tspecifically that deceased Nos. 1 and 2 were armed with any deadly weap- ons. Therefore, the assailants had definitely exceeded\t the right of private defence when they went to the extent of intentionally shooting them to death by inflicting bullet injuries. Therefore, the offence committed by them would be one punishable under Section 304 Part I I.P.C. The convic- tion of accused No. 1, 3, 4 and 6 under Section 302\tread with Section 149 I.P.C. and the sentence of rigorous impris- onment for life awarded thereunder is set aside and instead they are 576 convicted under Section 304 Part I read with\t Section 34 I.P.C.\tand each of them sentenced to undergo rigorous\t im- prisonment for 10 years. Their other convictions/sentences are confirmed the sentences to run concurrently. [608C-E]  Mohar Rai & Bharath Rai v. The State of Bihar, [1968] 3 S.C.R. 525; Lakshmi Singh & Ors. v.

From the Judgment and Order dated\t22.10.1984 in\tthe Allahabad High Court in Crl. A. Nos. 1925, 1808 of 1981\tand Government Appeal No. 2599 of 1981. R.K. Garg, Prith Raj, U.R. Lalit, R.L. Kohli, Shivpujan Singh, Manoj Prashad, Dalveer Bhandari, T. Sridharan (N.P.) and B.S. Chauhan for the appearing parties. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by K. JAYACHANDRA REDDY, J. On 29.5. 1981 at about 8 A.M. a grave rioting took place in the village of Tirro in Varanasi District. 1n the course of the said rioting\ttwo persons Mahendra Singh and Virendra Singh deceased Nos. 1 and 2 were killed\tand Vijay Narain Singh, P.W. 1, Uma Shankar Singh, P.W. 2 and one Kailash Singh received injuries. In respect of these offences 14 accused were tried under Sections 148 and 302 read with Sec.\t149 I.P.C.\tChirkut Singh, Accused No. 6 was tried\tfor offence punishable under Section 307 I.P.C. for attempting to commit the murder of P.W. 1 and the remaining accused under Section 307 read with Sec. 149 I.P.C. for causing injuries to\tUma Shankar Singh, P.W. 2 and Kailash Singh. It is alleged\tthat the material prosecution witnesses, deceased persons and the accused\tbelong to the same village. Since 1972\tthere\thave been disputes between these two rival groups. A number of cases were also pending in the courts. On the day of occur- rence at 8 A.M.P.W. 1 went to his pumping set. P.W. 2 Uma Shankar\tSingh and his relation Kailash Singh were also at the pumping set. Deceased Nos. 1 and\t2 were proceeding alongwith the rasta towards the pumping set for taking bath. When they reached near the Khandhar (old building) of Vijay Pratap\tSingh Accused No. 5 Lallan Singh exhorted the other accused who were all lying in wait to kill them. All the 14 accused emerged out of the Khandar. Out of them Accused Nos. 1, 3, 4 and 6 (accused Nos. are being referred to as arrayed before\tthe trial court) were armed with guns and the\trest were armed with lathis. They advanced towards deceased\tNos. 1 and 2. Accused No. 1 fired a shot which hit deceased No. 1 and he was immediately also shot at by accused No. 3 Ranjit Singh and he fell down. In the meanwhile Accused No. 4\tRam Briksh Singh fired at Deceased No. 2 Virendra Singh who fell down and both deceased died on the spot. The other accused carrying lathis advanced towards P.W. 1 who\tducked\tand escaped\tunhurt. Then the lathis-wielding accused assaulted P.W. 1\tVijay Narain Singh, P.W. 2 Uma\tShankar Singh\tand Kailash Singh. P.W. 1 managed to escape and ran away. The\ttrial court relying on the evidence of P.Ws. 1\tand 2, who\tare the main eye witnesses, convicted\tall the 14 accused of the offences for which they were charged and\tthe substantial sentence awarded is imprisonment for life under Section 302 I.P.C. read with Section 149 I.P.C. The convict- ed accused preferred appeals. The State also filed appeal for enhancement of the sentence. A Division Bench of\tthe Allahabad High Court consisting of Justice Katju and Justice Agrawal\theard the appeals. Justice' Katju allowed the\tap- peals filed by the accused and dismissed the appeal filed by the State but the other learned Judge disagreed and\tdis- missed all the appeals concurring with the trial court.\tThe matter\tcame up before a third Judge Seth, J. He took\tthe view that only such of those accused to whom specific overt acts were attributed could be convicted and the other should be given benefit of doubt. In that view of the matter he confirmed the convic- tion of Accused Nos. 1, 3, 4 and 6 and acquitted the\trest of the\taccused. Accused Nos.\t1, 3, 4 and 6 applied\tfor special\tleave\twhich was granted by this Court\tand theft appeals\tare numbered as Criminal Appeal Nos. 375-77/87\tand the State has preferred appeals against the acquittal of the other remaining 10 accused which are numbered\tas Criminal Appeal Nos. 372-74/87. It\tis contended on behalf of the State that the occur- rence has taken place in broad-day light and merely because the witnesses are interested their evidence cannot be\tre- jected and that the view taken by Justice Seth is incorrect and the view taken by the trial court as well as by Justice Agrawal\thas to be accepted. On the other hand, the counsel appearing for the accused submitted that witnesses who\twere partisans and\twere highly interested\thave made omnibus allegations and it is highly dangerous to accept their evidence because there is every likelihood\tof innocent persons\thaving\tbeen falsely implicated. It is\talso their further submission that the prosecution has not come forward with the whole truth; and that the origin of the occurrence has been suppressed in as much as injuries to some of\tthe accused persons have not been explained and consequently it must be held\tthat occurrence did not take place in\tthe manner\talleged\tby the prosecution and that\tunder these circumstances the truth from falsehood cannot be separated and therefore, none of the accused could be convicted. Before we consider these rival contentions some of\tthe facts which are not indispute may be noted. There was a longstanding rivalry between the two groups. The time\tand place of occurrence are not in controversy. That the\ttwo deceased persons died of gun-shots injuries also is not in dispute. P.Ws.\t1 and 2 also received injuries during\tthe course of this occurrence. The\tprosecution in support of its case examined P.Ws 1 to 11. P.W. 7 the Doctor examined P.W. 2 at about 11.40 A.M. on the\tsame day and found 10 injuries. All of them\twere contusions and he opined that they might have been caused by a blunt object like lathi. On the same day, he examined P.W. 1 and\ton his person he found four contusions\twhich could have been caused by Lathis. The Doctor also examined Kailash Singh,\twho was not examined as a witness. and found two contusions. P.W. 4 another Doctor who conducted postmortem on deceased No. 2 Virendra Singh found two gun-shots wounds on the cranial cavity. Injury No. 1 is an entry wound\tand injury No. 2 is an exist wound. Then he conducted the autop- sy on\tthe dead body of deceased No. 1. He found two\tin- juries, the first one is on the left nipple which is an entry wound and injury No. 2 is on the left palm. On internal examination he found a bullet embedded and the same was recovered. P.W. 5 is the Investi- gating Officer. After registration of the crime he undertook the investigation, went to the scene of occurrence, held the inquest of the two dead-bodies and recorded the statement of the witnesses. He also found two live cartridges one of 16 bore and another of 12 bore. P.W. 3 is another\teye-witness. He deposed that Accused Nos. 1, 3, 4 and 6 were armed with- guns and the other were armed with lathis. Accused No. 1 fired at the deceased No. 1 and Accused No. 3 also fired at him as a result of which he fell down and when deceased\tNo. 2 tried to move, Accused No. 4 shot at him and deceased\tNo. 2 also fell down. When P.Ws 1, 2 and Kailash Singh rushed towards\tthe place, accused No. 6 fired at P.W. 1 but he escaped. Then the lathi-wielding persons beat P.Ws 1 and 2 and Kailash Singh. To the same effect is the\tevidence of P .Ws\t1 and 2 also. Under Section 3 13 Cr.P.C. all\tthe circumstances appearing against the accused were put to them. They in general denied the offence. However, among them, accused Nos. 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13 and 14 admitted their presence at the scene of occurrence. Accused No. 6 in par- ticular\tstated\tthat P.W. 1 and others armed\twith guns, spears\tand lathis tried to do fishing in the pond in which accused No. 6 had a share. Accused No. 6 and others went to the pond for fishing. P.W. 1 and other challenged and\tthey chased accused No. 6 and others and accused No. 13 was\tshot at by\tP.W. 1 and others and he and accused No. 14\twere beaten\twith lathis and in defence he fired two gun shots hitting\tdeceased Nos. 1 and 2. He then went to\tthe police station and lodged a report and deposited his gun and\tthat P.W. 1 has falsely implicated him. As regards this report which is purported to have been given by accused No. 6, P.W. 5 the Investigating Officer was questioned. He admitted that when he returned to the Police Station on 30th May, 1980 he came to know that, accused No. 6 has surrendered his gun. He also admitted in the cross examination that the crime\twas registered on the basis of the report given by Chirkut Singh and the same was also investigating but it appears that no action\twas taken. Investigating Officer also admitted\tthat when he saw accused Nos. 13 and 14 he\tfound\tinjuries on them. The other circumstance strongly relied upon by\tthe defence is that there were gun shots injuries on accused No. 13. It may be noted that the same has not been explained by the prosecution. P.W. 7 the Doctor admitted that he examined Accused No. 14 and found on him a skindeep 12\" x 2\" lacerat- ed wound on the left thigh and a wound certificate\twas issued. He also admitted that he examined accused No. 13 and he found five tiny abrasions in the area of 4cm x 4cm on outer surface of right thigh just above knee joint and\tthe injured was refer- red to the radiologist. P.W. 7, however, stated that he\thas not seen the report of the radiologist. The defence examined Dr. S.K. Singh as D.W. 1. He deposed that he took the X-ray of the right thigh of the accused No. 13 Mahendra Kahar\tand the report was marked as an exhibit. He further deposed that the shadows in the X-ray go to show that there were 10 radio opaque round shadows and these shadows may very well corre- spond to the pallets fired by some fire arms and the\tsame appear\tto have pierced upto muscles and bone. His examina- tion further showed that the pallets remained\tembedded in the thigh. Before the trial court as well as before the High Court, firstly\tit was contended on behalf of the accused that\tthe eye witnesses\tare highly interested and therefore, their evidence cannot be accepted and even otherwise they have not come out with the whole truth and the injuries found on\ttwo of the accused would go to show that the accused. acted in fight of self-defence. Relying on the presence of gun-shots injuries on accused No. 13 it was strongly contended\tthat the prosecution party have also used fire-arms and, there- fore, the accused were entitled to the fight of private defence. The trial court accepted the evidence of all\tthe three witnesses holding that their evidence is consistent and does not suffer from any serious infirmity. So far as the plea of self-defence is concerned, the trial court\theld that the plea taken by accused No. 6 was to\tbe rejected mainly on the ground that there was no material to show that at the pond the fishing operations were going on. As regards the presence of injuries on the accused persons, learned Sessions Judge having regard to the nature and size of\tthe injuries found on accused Nos. 13 and 14 took the view\tthat they are simple and that it is not proved that these\tin- juries\twere received during the occurrence. Regarding\tthe presence of the alleged gun-shots injuries on accused No. 13 he pointed out that the medical evidence is inconclusive on the point whether those injuries were caused at the\ttime when this incident took place. In the appeal before the High Court, Justice Katju took the view that the theory that\tthe injuries on accused Nos. 13 and 14 were self inflicted cannot be accepted and that the plea taken by accused No. 6 appears\tto be probable in view of the fact that the bullet found in the dead body of deceased No. 2 was fired by a\t16- Bore gun and that as admitted by the Investigating Officer, P.W. 5, it was accused No. 6 only in that area who had a licence\tfor 16-Bore gun which was deposited by him in\tthe police station after the occurrence. Coming to the injuries found on accused Nos. 13 and 14 Justice Katju took the\tview that they received injuries during the course of the\tsame occurrence and that the three eye-witnesses have not\tfur- nished\tany explanation regarding those injuries and\tthat these witnesses have falsely implicated some of the accused due to enmity and, therefore, their evidence cannot be relied upon and accordingly ordered total acquittal. As already\tmen- tioned\tJustice Agrawal, on the other hand, agreed with\tthe trial court completely. Justice Seth, to whom the case\twas referred because of the difference of opinion took a third view and convicted only accused Nos. 1, 3, 4 and 6 to\twhom specifically overt acts were attributed. Dealing with\tthe plea of self defence Justice Seth held that lacerated injury on accused No. 14 was a simple one and he could have\tre- ceived that even subsequent to the occurrence. With regard to the gun-shots injuries found on accused No. 13 Mahendra Kahar, the learned Judge himself examined accused No. 13 who was present in the Court when the appeal was being heard and found that hard substance were palpable underneath the flesh round about the location of his injury. In the circumstances it does appear that fire-arm shots to exist underneath\tthe location of injury found on the person of accused Mahendra Kahar.\tBut he ultimately held that in all probability\tthe pallets\tfound in the leg of accused No. 13 Mahendra Kahar must have been there long before the incident, as in\tthe view of the learned Judge it was doubtful that those pallets could have entered the body through the external injuries which are described as tiny abrasions. Seth, J.\taccordingly rejected the plea of self defence. Before we\tadvert to the above contentions\tit becomes necessary to consider whether the accused No.\t13 Mahendra Kahar and accused No. 14 Sant Singh received the injuries during the course of occurrence. P.W. 7 the Doctor examined accused No. 13 Mahendra Kahar on 30.5. 1980 at about 6\tA.M. and he found the following injuries. 1. Five tiny abrasions in the area of 4cm x 4cm on outer surface of fight thigh just above knee joint. 2. The injured complained of pain in the right thumb\tand left forearm. In respect of injury No. 1 the Doctor advised X-ray with a view to ascertain whether or not there were pallets,\tand pending the same he reserved his opinion. P.W. 7 also opined that injuries appeared to have been caused within 24 hours preceding the medical examination which correspond to\tthe time of occurrence, namely, 8 A.M. on 29.5. 1980. P.W. 7, however, stated that the X-ray report was not shown to\thim. The evidence of P.W. 7 makes it clear that accused No. 13 Mahendra Kahar received these injuries during the course of the occurrence. D.W. 1 is the Doctor who took the X-ray. He deposed that on 5.6.80 he took the X-ray of the fight thigh of the undertrial prisoner Mahendra Kahar accused No. 13 and the same is marked as Ex-Kha- 12. On the basis of the X-ray plate he opined that he noticed 10 radio opaque round shad- ows in the injured and they correspond to the pallets fired by some fire-arm. Justice Seth considered the evidence of these two Doctors. He also examined the accused in the Court and he found that hard substance were\tpalpable underneath the flesh. As already mentioned he was of the view\tthat these appeared to be pallets but according to him they\tmust have been there long before the incident. The learned Judge took this view because he was doubtful that those pallets could have entered the body through the external injuries which are described as tiny abrasions. Having given\tour careful\tconsideration we are unable to agree with the\tview taken by Seth, J.P.W. 7 the Doctor's evidence makes it clear that the external injuries were caused during\tthis occur- rence only and underneath the same these pallets were found by the\tradiologist D.W. 1. The injuries are not self-in- flicted. Therefore, there is no basis whatsoever to presume that the pallets under the flesh must have been there\tal- ready even before this occurrence took place. As a matter of fact accused No. 13 Mahendra Kahar was referred to\tthe Doctor\tP.W. 7\tsince there was an injury. P.W. 7 having examined him found that there were 10 ' radio opaque round shadows\tunderneath the injury and it was only for\tthat reason he referred the injured to the radiologist and D.W. 1 the radiologist after taking the X-ray concluded that under- neath the injury pallets discharged from a fire-arm\twere embedded in the flesh. Therefore, the only view that is possible is that accused No. 13 Mahendra Kahar received gun-shot injuries during the course of this occurrence only. P.W. 7 also examined accused No. 14 Sant Singh on the\tsame day. He found a skin-deep 12' x2' lacerated wound vertically inflicted on the front and outer surface of left thigh\tfrom which blood was oozing and the injured complained of pain. The Doctor pointed out that the injury was simple and could have been caused by blunt weapon like a lathi.\tThe injury was also stitched. It is suggested by the prosecution\tthat this could have been a self-inflicted one but again there is no basis for such presumption. The Investigating Officer said that on\tfinding the injury on him he was sent\tfor medical\texamination. As a matter of fact accused No. 6 in his statement under Section 313 stated that accused Nos. 13 and 14\treceived injuries and he also went to\tthe police station\tand lodged a report to that effect. It, therefore, emerges\tthat accused No. 13 received gun-shot injuries\tand accused\tNo. 14 received lacerated injury during the course of the\tsame occurrence and these injuries must have\tbeen caused by some member belonging to the prosecution party. Now\tthe question is whether the prosecution has\tex- plained\tthese injuries and if there is no such explanation what would be its effect? We are not prepared to agree\twith the learned counsel for the defence that in each and every case where prosecution fails to explain the injuries found on some of the accused, the prosecution case should automat- ically\tbe rejected, without any further probe. He placed considerable reliance\ton some of the\tjudgments of\tthis Court.\tIn Mohar Rai & Bharath' Rai v. The State of Bihar, [1968] 3 SCR 525, it is observed: \"Therefore the version of the appellants that they sustained injuries at the time of the occurrence is highly probabi- lised. Under these circumstances the prosecution had a\tduty to explain those injuries. The evidence of Dr. Bishnu Prasad Sinha (P.W. 18) clearly shows that those injuries could\tnot have been self-inflicted and further, according to him it was most unlikely that they would have been caused at\tthe instance of the appellants themselves. Under these circum- stances we are unable to agree with the High Court that\tthe prosecution had no duty to offer any explanation as regards those injuries. In our judgment, the failure of the prosecu- tion to offer any explanation in that\tregard\tshows\tthat evidence of the prosecution witnesses relating to the inci- dent is not true or at any rate not wholly true. Further those\tinjuries probabilise\tthe plea taken by\tthe appellants.\" In another important case Lakshmi Singh and Ors. v. State of Bihar,\t[1976] 4 SCC 394, after referring to the ratio\tlaid down in Mohar Rai's case, this Court observed: \"Where the prosecution fails to explain the injuries on\tthe accused, two results follow: (1) that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses is\tun- true; and that the injuries probabilise the plea taken by the appellants. It was further observed that: \"In a\tmurder\tcase, the non-explanation of the injuries sustained by the accused at about the time of the occur- rence or in the course of altercation is a very important circumstance from which the court can draw the following inferences: (1) that the prosecution has suppressed the genesis and\tthe origin of the occurrence and has thus not presented the true version; (2) that the witnesses who have denied the presence of\tthe injuries on the person of the accused are lying on a\tmost material point and, therefore, their evidence is unreliable. (3) that in case there is a defence version which explains the injuries on the person of the accused assumes\tmuch greater importance where the evidence consists of interested or inimical witnesses or where the defence gives a version which competes in probability with that of the\tprosecution one.\" Relying\ton these two cases the learned counsel for\tthe defence\tcontended that in the instant case the\tprosecution has failed to explain the injuries on the two\taccused\tand the genesis and the origin of the occurrence have\tbeen suppressed and a true version has not been presented before the Court and consequently the truth from falsehood cannot be separated and consequently the entire prosecution\tcase must be rejected. We are unable to agree. In\tMohar Rai's case it is made clear that failure of the prosecution to offer any explanation regarding the injuries found on\tthe accused\tmay show that the evidence related to the incident is not\ttrue or at any rate not wholly true.\tLikewise in Lakshmi Singh's case also it is observed that any non-expla- nation of the injuries on the accused by the prosecution may affect the prosecution case. But such a non-explanation\tmay assume\tgreater\timportance where the evidence\tconsists of interested or inimical witnesses or where the defence gives a version which competes in probability with that of\tthe prosecution. But where the evidence is clear,\tcogent\tand creditworthy and where the Court can distinguish the truth from falsehood\tthe mere fact that the injuries are\tnot explained by the prosecution cannot by itself\tbe a\tsole basis to reject such evidence, and consequently the whole case. Much depends on the facts and circumstances of\teach case. In the instant case, the trial court as well as\tthe two learned Judges of the High Court accepted the prosecu- tion case as put forward by P.Ws 1 to 3 in their evidence. The presence of these three witnesses could not be doubted at all. P.Ws 1 and 2 are the injured witnesses and P.W. 1 gave a report giving all the details. However, he attributed specific overt\tacts to accused Nos. 1, 3, 4 and 6 and made an omnibus allegation against\tthe remaining accused. It is for this\treason\tthat Justice\tSeth found it to be safe to convict only accused Nos. 1, 3, 4 and 6 who are the appellants before us. P.Ws 1, 2 and 3 are the eye witnesses. We have carefully considered their evidence and nothing material is elicited in the cross examination which renders their evidence wholly\tuntrustwor- thy. No doubt they have not explained the injuries found on accused\tNos. 13 and 14. From this alone it cannot be\tsaid that the prosecution has suppressed the genesis and\tthe origin\tof the occurrence and has not presented a true\tver- sion. Though they are interested, we find that\ttheir\tevi- dence is clear, cogent and convincing. The only reasonable inference that can be drawn is that the two accused persons received the injuries during the course of the occurrence which were inflicted on them by some members of the prosecu- tion party. As\tdiscussed above we are satisfied in this case\tthat nonexplanation of injuries on these two accused persons does not affect the prosecution case as a whole but in a case of this nature what all that the defence can contend on\tthe basis of non-explanation of injuries found on these\ttwo accused\tis that the accused could have had a right of\tpri- vate defence or at any rate a reasonable doubt arises in this regard. The\tlearned counsel for the defence, however, submits that if for any reason the prosecution case in its entirety is not rejected because of the non-explanation of the\tin- juries found on these two accused, yet the right of private defence\tof the accused cannot be denied and that on\tthat score also these four convicted accused are entitled to an acquittal. It is also their submission that a careful exami- nation\tof the provisions of Sections 96, 99 and 102 I.P.C. would show that on a reasonable apprehension\tof grievous hurt or death the accused had a right even to the extent of causing\tthe death of the assailants and they cannot be expected to modulate this right in such a situation and that in the\tinstant case these four appellants were justified even to the extent of causing death of the two deceased by inflicting gun-shot wounds. In this' context\tit is\talso submitted that\tthe plea taken by accused No.\t6, Chirkut Singh that he shot at the two deceased persons in self- defence cannot be brushed aside. We should at this juncture point out that the plea taken by accused No. 6, Chirkut Singh does not commend itself. The same appears\tto be an after-thought. The observation report\tand other circumstances in the case would show that there\twere no fishing operations in the pond. Therefore, the plea of accused\tNo. 6, Chirkut Singh that fishing operations\twere going on in the pond and that he and some of the other accused\twent there and that was the genesis and the origin of the\toccurrence, has no basis whatsoever. On the other hand, the evidence of the eye-witnesses regarding the time, place and manner of occurrence in general, as put forward by the prosecution, cannot be doubted at all. We shall now consider the submission whether the accused had the right of self-defence. Learned counsel for the State contended that if the accused want to claim the benefit of the general or special exception of the right\tof private defence\tthen they should plead and discharge the burden by establishing that they are entitled to the benefit of excep- tion as provided under Section 105 of the Evidence Act. In other words, the submission is that the burden of proof of the existence of such a right is on the accused and that in the instant case the accused have not discharged the burden and that mere presence of simple injuries on\tthe accused cannot\tnecessarily lead to an inference that\tthey had a right of self-defence. We have already held\tthat having regard\tto the facts and circumstances of the\tcase,\tmere non-explanation of these injuries by the prosecution cannot render\tthe whole case unacceptable. We have also held\tthat those injuries on one of the accused No. 13, Mahendra Kahar were inflicted\tby a fire-arm during the same\toccurrence. Under these circumstances, the important question that we have to consider is whether the accused should be denied the benefit of an exception on the ground that the accused\thave not discharged the necessary burden of\testablishing their right to the benefit of the exception beyond all reasonable doubt just like the prosecution is bound under Section\t102 of the\tEvidence Act, or if upon a consideration of\tthe evidence as a whole and the surrounding facts\tand circum- stances\tof the case, a reasonable doubt is created in\tthe mind of the court about the existence of such a right wheth- er the\taccused, in such a situation, is entitled to\tthe benefit\tof the said exception, i.e. the right\tof private defence. If so, whether they have exceeded the same? The nature and extent of the burden that the accused has to discharge under Section 105 of the Evidence Act has\tbeen one of questions of great general importance and for consid- erable time the opinions of the Courts were not uniform. As a matter of fact, in Partap v. State of U.P., AIR 1976 SC 966, this Court noted \"that the question of law that arises here seems to have troubled several\tHigh Courts.\" The phrase \"burden of proof\" is not defined in the\tAct. In respect of criminal cases, it is an accepted principle of criminal jurisprudence\tthat the burden is always on\tthe prosecution and never shifts. This flows from the cardinal principle that the accused is presumed to be innocent unless proved guilty by the prosecution and the accused is entitled to the benefit of every reasonable doubt. Section 105 of the Evidence Act is in the following terms: \"When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving\tthe existence of circumstances bringing the\tcase within\tany of the General Exceptions in the Indian Penal Code, or within any special exception or proviso contained in any other part of the same Code, or in any law defining the offence, is upon him, and the Court shall\tpresume\tthe absence of such circumstances.\" The Section to some extent places the onus of\tproving\tany exception in a penal statute on the accused. The burden of proving\tthe existence of circumstances bringing the\tcase within\tthe exceptions mentioned therein is upon him.\tThe Section further lays down that the Court shall presume\tnon- existence of circumstances bringing the case within an exception.\" The words \"the burden of proving the existence of circumstances\" occuring in the Section are very signifi- cant. It is wellsettled that \"this burden\" which rests on the accused does not absolve the prosecution from discharg- ing its initial burden of establishing the case beyond\tall reasonable doubts. It is also well-settled that the accused need not set up a specific plea of his offence\tand adduce evidence. That being so the question is: what is the nature of burden that lies on the accused under Section 105 if benefit\tof the general exception of\tprivate\tdefence is claimed and how it can be discharged? In Woolmington v.\tThe Director of Public Prosecutions, [1935] Appeal\tCases\t462, Viscount Sankey, L.C. observed: \"When evidence of death and malice has been given (this is a question for the jury), the prisoner is entitled to show by evidence or by examination of the circumstances adduced by the Crown that the act on his part which caused death\twas either\tunintentional or provoked. If the jury\tare either satisfied with his explanation or, upon a review of all, the evidence are left in reasonable doubt whether, even if\this explanation be not accepted,' the act was unintentional or provoked, the prisoner is entitled to be acquitted.\" It is further observed: \"Just as there is evidence on behalf of the prosecution so there may be evidence on behalf of the prisoner which\tmay cause a doubt as to his guilt. In either case, he is enti- tled to the benefit of the doubt. But while the\tprosecution must prove the guilt of the prisoner, there\tis no\tsuch burden laid on the prisoner to prove his innocence and it is sufficient for him to raise a doubt as to his guilt; he is not bound to satisfy the jury of his innocence ... Through- out the web of the English criminal law one golden thread is always to be seen, that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the prisoner's guilt subject to what I have already said as to the defence of insanity and subject also to\tany stationary exception. If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there is reasonable doubt created by the evidence given by either the prosecution or the prisoner as to wheth- er the prisoner killed the deceased with a malicious inten- tion, the prosecution has not made out the case and\tthe prisoner is entitled to an acquittal. No matter what\tthe charge\tor where the trial, the principle that the prosecu- tion must prove the guilt of the prisoner is part of\tthe common law of England and no attempt to whittle it down\tcan be entertained.\" Emperor v.U. Dampala, AIR 1937 Rangoon 83 a full Bench of the Rangoon High Court following the Woolmington's\tcase held that the ratio therein is not in any way\tinconsistent with the law in British India, and that indeed the princi- ples there laid down from valuable guide to\tthe correct interpretation\tof Section 105 of the Evidence Act and\tthe full Bench laid down that even if the evidence\tadduced by the accused fails to prove the existence of circumstances bringing the case within the exception or exceptions plead- ed, the accused is entitled to be acquitted if upon a\tcon- sideration of the evidence as a whole the court is left in a state of reasonable doubt as to whether the accused is or is not entitled to the benefit of the exception pleaded. We\thave noticed that Section 105 requires that when a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving\tthe existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the General Exceptions or special exception\tor proviso contained in any pan of the Penal Code is on him\tand the Court shall presume the absence of\tsuch circumstances.\tThis presumption is rebuttable.\t In Parbhoo and Ors. v. Emperor, AIR 1941 Allahabad 402, a Full Bench of seven Judges considered the scope of Sections 102 and 105 of the Evidence Act. The majority agreed with the view taken by the Full Bench in Dampala's case. In Parbhoo's case Bajpai, J. in his concurring judgment observed that Section 105 is stated\tin two forms, that of a rule as to the burden of proof and that of a presumption and that the burden of proving the guilt of the accused always rests on the prose- cution and never: shifts and the learned Judge further\theld that the doubt cast in connection with the right of private defence\tmust be a reasonable doubt and if there is such a reasonable doubt, it casts a doubt on the entire case of the prosecution and that the result is that the accused gets a benefit of doubt. \"The presumption laid down in Section\t105 of the\tEvidence Act might come into play but it does\tnot follow\ttherefrom that the accused must be convicted\teven when the reasonable doubt under the plea of the right of private\tdefence or under any other plea contained in\tthe general\tor special exceptions pervades the whole case.\" In Dampala's case Dunkley, J. while concurring with the majori- ty view after discussing the law on the subject observed: \"The conclusion therefore is that if the Court either is satisfied from the examination of the accused and the\tevi- dence adduced by him, or from the circumstances appearing from the prosecution evidence, that the existence of circum- stances bringing the case within the exception or exceptions pleaded\thas been proved, or upon a review of all the\tevi- dence is left in reasonable doubt whether such circumstances had existed or not, the accused in the case of a general exception is entitled to be acquitted, or, in the case of a special exception, can be convicted of a minor offence.\" This case has been followed subsequently by a number of High Courts. In K.M. Nanavati v. State of Maharashtra, [1962] Suppl. 1 SCR 567 it is observed that: \"In India, as it is in England, there is a presumption of innocence in favour of the accused as a general rule, and it is the duty of the prosecution' to prove 'the guilt of\tthe accused. But when an accused relies upon the General Excep- tions in the Indian Penal Code or on any special exception or proviso contained in any other part of\tthe Penal Code, or in any law defining an offence, Section\t105 of the Evidence Act raises a presumption against the accused and also throws a burden on him to rebut the said presump- tion. Under that Section the Courts shall presume the ab- sence of circumstances bringing the case within any of\tthe exceptions, that is, the Court shall regard the nonexistence of such circumstances as proved till they are disproved. This presumption may also be rebutted by admissions made or circumstances elicited by the evidence led by the prosecu- tion or by the combined effect of such circumstances and the evidence adduced by the accused. But the section does not in any way affect the burden that lies on the prosecution to prove all the ingredients, of the offence with which\tthe accused\tis charged; that burden never shifts.\tThe alleged conflict between the general burden which lies on the prose- cution\tand the special burden imposed on the accused under Section 105 of the Evidence Act is more imaginary then real. Indeed, there is no conflict at all.\" In Dahyabhai Chhaganbhai Thakkar v. State of Gujarat,\tAIR 1964 SC 1563 it is observed: \"It is fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence\tthat an accused is presumed to be innocent and therefore,\tthe burden\tlies on the prosecution to prove the guilt of\tthe accused beyond reasonable doubt. The prosecution, therefore, in a case of homicide shall prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused caused death with the requisite intention described in Section 299 of the Penal\tCode.\tThe general burden never shifts and it always rests on the\tprosecution. But, under Section 105 of the Evidence Act the burden of proving\tthe existence of circumstances bringing the\tcase within the exception lies on the accused; and the Court shah presume the absence of such circumstances. Under Section 105 of the\tEvidence Act, read with the definition of \"shall presume\" in Section 4 thereof, the Court shall regard the absence of such circumstances as proved unless, after considering the matters before it, it believes that the said circumstances existed Or their existence\twas so probable that a prudent man ought,\tunder\tthe circum- stances of the particular case, to act upon the\tsupposition that they did exist. To put it in other words, the accused will have to rebut the presumption that such circumstances did not exist, by placing material before the Court suffi- cient to make it consider the existence of the said Circum- stances so-probable that a prudent man would act upon them. The accused has to satisfy the standard of a \"prudent man\". If the material placed before the Court such as, oral\tand documentary evidence, presumptions, admissions or even\tthe prosecution evidence, satisfied the test of \"prudent man\", the accused will have discharged his burden. The evidence so placed\tmay not be sufficient to discharge the burden under Section 105 of the Evidence Act, but it may raise a reasona- ble doubt in the mind of a Judge as regards one or other of the necessary ingredients of the offence itself. It may, for instance, raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of the Judge whether the accused had the requisite intention laid down in Section 299 of the Penal Code.\" A careful reading of these two decisions would reveal\tthat the statement of law therein neither expressly or impliedly overrules or is in conflict with the majority view in Parb- hoo's case. However,\tin Rishi Kesh Singh & Ors. v.\tThe State, AIR 1970 Allahabad 51, the question that came up\tfor consideration before a Larger Bench\tconsisting of\tnine Judges\twas whether the dictum in Parbhoo's case is still a good law on the ground that some of the decisions of\tthe Supreme\tCourt have cast a cloud of doubt. A\tmajority of seven Judges approved the principle laid down in Parbhoo's case. The Larger Bench also referred to various subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court also including the Nanavati's case; Bhikari v. State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1966 SC 1\tand Dahyabhai's case, Beg, J., as he then was, in a separate but concurring judgment after referring to the Nanavati's case; Bhikari's ease; Dahyabhai's case and Mohar Rai & Bharath Rai's case, held that there is no conflict between what\twas held by the Supreme Court and the majority view taken in Parbhoo's case. After analysing the view expressed by\tthe Surpeme Court in the several above mentioned decisions, Beg, J. observed: \"After\ta close scrutiny of every part of each of the seven opinions in Parbhoo's case [1941] All LJ 619=AIR 1941\tAll 402 (FB). I have come to the conclusion that the majority of their Lordships did not lay down anything beyond three important propositions\twhich, if not\teither\tdirectly or indirectly supported by decisions of their Lordships of\tthe Supreme Court have not been affected in the slightest degree by these decisions. These propositions are; firstly, that no evidence appearing in the case to support the exception pleaded\tby the accused can be excluded altogether from consideration on the ground that the accused has not proved. his plea fully; secondly, that the obligatory\t.presumption at.the\tend of Sec. 105 is necessarily lifted at least\twhen there is enough evidence on record to justify\tgiving\tthe benefit\tof doubt to the accused on the question whether he is guilty of the offence with which he is charged;\tand, thirdly, if the doubt, though raised due to\tevidence in support of the exception pleaded, is reasonable and affects an ingredient of the offence with which the\taccused is charged, the accused would be entitled to an acquittal. As I read the answer of the majority in Parbhoo's case [1941] All LJ 619=AIR 1941 All 402 (FB). I find it based on these three propositions which provide the ratio decidendi and this is all that needs t6 be clarified.\" \"The practical result of the three propositions stated above is that an accused's plea or an exception may reach one of three not sharply demarcated stages,\tone succeeding\tthe other, depending upon the effect of the whole\tevidence in the case judged by the standard Of a prudent man weighing or balancing probabilities carefully. These stages are; first- ly, a lifting of the initial obligatory presumption given at the end of Sec. 105 of the Act; secondly the creation of a reasonable doubt about the existence of an ingredient of the offence; and thirdly, a complete proof of the exception by \"a preponderance of probability\", which covers even a slight tilt of the balance of probability in favour .of the\tac- cused's plea. The accused is not entitled to an acquittal if his plea does not get beyond the first stage. At the second stage, he becomes entitled to acquittal by obtaining a\tbare benefit\tof doubt. At the third stage,\the is\tundoubtedly entitled to an acquittal. This, in my opinion, is the effect of the majority view in Parbhoo's case which directly\tre- lates tO first two stages only. The Supreme Court decisions\thave considered the last two stages so far, but the first stage has not yet been dealt with directly or separately there in any case brought to our notice.\" Mathur, J., with whom five Judges agreed, while holding that ratio laid down by the majority in Parbhoo's\tcase is in conformity with law, however, observed that the reasoning in support\tof the conclusions is erroneous. Beg, J. was\tnot prepared to go to that extent. The majority speaking through Shri Mathut, J. laid' down that the dictum in Parbhoo's case which is still a good law, can, however, be\tmodified as follows: \"In a\tcase in which any General Exception in\tthe Indian Penal Code, or any special exception or proviso contained in another\tpart of the same Code, or in any law defining\tthe offence, is pleaded or raised by an accused persons and\tthe evidence led in support of such plea, judged by the test of the preponderance of probability, as in a civil\tproceeding, fails to displace the presumption arising from Section\t105 of the Evidence Act, in other words, to disprove the absence of circumstances bringing the case within the\tsaid excep- tion; but upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, including the evidence given in support of the plea based on the said exception or proviso, a reasonable doubt is created in the mind of the Court, as regards one or more the ingre- dients of the offence, the accused person shall be entitled to the benefit of the reasonable doubt as to his guilt\tand hence to acquittal of the said offence.\" Learned counsel for the State, however, submitted\tthat if the\tview taken by the Allahabad High Court is to be accepted then it would amount to throwing the burden on\tthe prosecution not only to establish the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable doubt but also that the accused is not entitled to benefit of any exception and if such a principle is laid down then Section 105 of the Evidence Act would be rendered otiose and there would be inconsistency between Sections 102' and 105. This very question has been answered by the Supreme Court in Nanavati's case and it has been held that the general burden of proving the ingredients of\tthe offence\tis always on the prosecution but the burden of proving\tthe circumstances attracting the exception lies on the accused. But the failure on the part of the accused to establish all the circumstances bringing his case under\tthe exception does not absolve the prosecution to prove the ingredients of the offence and the evidence relied upon by the accused in support of his claim for the benefit of the exception though insufficient to establish the exception may be sufficient to negative one or other of the ingredients of the offence\tand thus throw a reasonable doubt on the essential\tingredients of the\toffence of murder. The accused for the\tpurpose of discharging this burden under Section 105 can rely also on the probabilities. As observed in Dahyabhai's case\t\"the accused will have to rebut the presumption that such circum- stances did not exist\" by placing material before the court which satisfies the standard of a prudent man and the mate- rial may consist of oral and documentary evidence, presump- tions,\tadmissions or even the prosecution evidence and\tthe material so placed may not be sufficient to discharge\tthe burden\tunder Section 105 of the Evidence Act\tbut it\tmay raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of a Judge as regards one or\tother of the necessary ingredients of\tthe offence itself.\tTherefore there is no such infirmity in the\tview taken in these cases about the scope and effect of Sections 102 and 105 of the Evidence Act. We\thave not come across any case of the Supreme Court where the ratio laid down in Parbhoo's case and which\twas subsequently approved\tby a larger Bench in\tRishi\tKesh Singh's case has been considered comprehensively. However, in Behram Khurshed Pesikaka v. The State of Bombay, [1955] 1 SCR 6 13 there is a specific reference to Parbhoo's case and Woolmington's case while considering\tthe scope and the manner of the expression 'burden of proof', in the judgment of Hon' Venkatarama Ayyar, J. But the learned Judge was not prepared to go into this question in an appeal under Article 136 but only noted that the Bombay High Court in Government\tof Bombay v. Sakur, AIR 1947 Bombay 38\thas taken a different view. In State of U.P.v. Ram Swarup, AIR 1974 SC 1570 a Bench consisting of M.H. Beg, J., as he then was, Y.V. Chandrachud and V.R. Krishna lyer, JJ., while considering the right of private\tdefence put forward by the accused to\tsome extent went into the question of burden of proof under Section\t105 and a reference is made to a decision of the larger Bench in Rishi Kesh Singh's case. Chandrachud, J. who spoke for\tthe Bench, observed thus: \"The judgment in Rishikesh Singh v. State, AIR 1970 All 51 explains the true nature and effect of the different types of presumptions arising under Section 105 of the Evidence Act. As stated is that judgment, while the initial presump- tion regarding\tthe absence of circumstances bringing the case within an exception may be met by showing the existence of appropriate\tfacts, the burden to establish\ta plea of private\tdefence by a balance of probabilities\tis a\tmore difficult burden to discharge. The judgment points out\tthat despite\tthis position there may be cases where, though\tthe plea of private defence is not established by an accused on a balance of probabilities, yet the totality of facts\tand circumstances may still throw a reasonable doubt on\tthe existence of \"mensrea\" which normally is an essential ingre- dient of an offence. The present is not a case of\tthis latter kind.\" We may also refer to a judgment of a Bench of three Judges consisting of M.H. Beg, P.N. Bhagwati and R.S. Sarkaria, JJ. in Partap's case. Sarkaria, J. speaking for\thimself\tand Bhagwati, J. observed: \"We have carefully scrutinised the judgments of the courts below.\tIn our opinion, their finding in regard to the\tplea of self-defence is clearly erroneous. They appear to\thave overlooked the distinction between the nature of burden that rests on an accused under Sec. 105, Evidence Act to estab- lish a plea of self-defence and the one cast on the prosecu- tion by Section 101 to prove its case. It is\twellsettled that the burden on the accused is not as onerous as\tthat which lies on the prosecution. While\tthe prosecution is required to prove its case beyond a reasonable\tdoubt,\tthe accused\tcan discharge his onus by establishing a mere\tpre- ponderance of probability.\" Beg, J., however in a separate judgment felt a doubt about the veracity of the defence case and the evidence found in support\tof it to be able to hold that it is proved on a balance\tof probabilities. But in his view what transpires from a\tconsideration of the whole evidence is enough to entitle the accused to a benefit of doubt. Beg, J. referred to the judgments of the Full Bench in Parbhoo's case; Nana- vati's\tcase and the larger Bench decision in\tRishi\tKesh Singh's case and applying the principles of benefit of doubt laid in the above three cases to the facts of the\tcase before them observed: \"Applying the principle of benefit of doubt as I had exp- lained\tabove, to the plea of private defence of person in the instant case. I think that, even if the appellant\tdid not fully establish his plea, yet, there is sufficient evidence, both\tdirect and circumstantial, to\tjustify\tthe finding\tthat the prosecution has not established its\tcase beyond reasonable doubt against Partap on an essential ingredient of the offence of murder; the required mensrea. After examining all the facts and circumstances revealed by the prosecution evidence itself and the defence evidence and considering the effect of non-production of\tthe better evidence available which, for some unexplained reason,\twas not produced. I am not satisfied that the plea\tof private defence of person can be reasonably ruled out here. This is enough,\tin my opinion, to entitle the appellant to get\tthe benefit of doubt. ' ' In Mohd. Ramzani v. State of Delhi, AIR 1980 SC 134 1\tSar- karia,\tJ., who spoke for the Bench, observed that the\tonus which rests on the accused person under Section 105,\tEvi- dence Act, to establish his plea of private defence is not as onerous as the unshifting burden which lies on the prose- cution\tto establish every ingredient of the offence\twith which the accused is charged beyond reasonable doubt. There- fore, the contrary view taken by the Bombay High Court in Sakur's case and in State v. Bhima Devraj, AIR 1956 Sau. 77 that the burden is entirely on the accused to establish that he is entitled to the benefit of the exception, does not lay down the correct law. At\tthis stage it becomes necessary to consider\tthe meaning of the words \"the Court shall presume the absence of such circumstances\" occurring in Section 105 of the Evidence Act. Section 4 of the Act explains the meaning of the\tterm \"shall\tpresume\" as to mean that the Court shall regard\tthe fact as proved unless and until it is disproved. 'From a combined reading of these two Sections it may\tbe inferred that where the existence of circumstances bringing the\tcase within the exception is pleaded or is raised the Court shall presume\tthe absence of such circumstances as proved unless and until it is disproved. In Section 3 of the Act meaning of the\tterms \"proved\", \"disproved\" and \"not\tproved\"\tare given. As per this provision, a fact is said to be \"proved\" when, after considering the matters before it, the Court either\tbelieves it to exist, or considers its existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that it exists. A fact is said to be \"disproved\" when, after consid- ering the matters before it, the Court either believes that it does not exist, or considers its non-existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that it does not exist. A fact is said to be \"not proved\" when it is neither \"proved\" nor \"disproved.\" The\tfirst part of Section 105 as noted above lays\tdown that when a person is accused of an offence, the burden of proving\tthe existence of circumstances bringing the\tcase within\tany of the exceptions or proviso is on him and\tthe latter part of it lays down that the Court shall presume the absence\tof such circumstances. In a given case the accused may discharge the burden by expressly proving the existence of such circumstances, thereby he is able to disprove\tthe absence of circumstances also. But where he is unable to discharge the burden by expressly proving the existence of such circumstances or he is unable to disprove the absence of such circumstances, then the case would fall in\tthe category of \"not proved\" and the Court may\tpresume\tthe absence of such circumstances. In this background we have to examine\tthe meaning of the words \"the Court shall presume the absence of such circumstances\" bearing in mind\tthe general principle of criminal jurisprudence that the prose- cution has to prove its case beyond all reasonable doubt and the benefit of every reasonable doubt should\tgo to\tthe accused. It will be useful to refer to some of the passages\tfrom the text books of outstanding authors on evidence and\tthen proceed to consider the ratio laid down by the Supreme Court cases on this aspect. In Phipson on Evidence, 13th edn. page 44, a passage reads as follows: \"The burden is upon the prosecution of proving a defendant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt before he is convicted.\tEven where the evidential burden shifts to\tthe defendant\tthe burden of establishing proof beyond reasonable doubt remains upon the prosecution and never changes. If on the whole case the jury have such a doubt the defendant is entitled to be acquitted.\" Another passage at page 48 reads as follows:' \"In criminal cases the prosecution discharge their eviden- tial burden by adducing sufficient evidence to raise a prima facie case against the accused. If no evidence is called for the defence the tribunal of fact must decide\twhether\tthe prosecution has succeeded in discharging its persuasive burden by proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any defence evidence, the chances that the prose- cution has so succeeded fare greater. Hence the accused\tmay be said to be under an evidential burden if the prosecution has established a prima facie case. Discharge of the eviden- tial burden by defence is not a pre-requisite to an acquit- tal. The accused is entitled to be acquitted if at the\tend of and on the whole of the case, there is a reasonable doubt created by the evidence given by either the prosecution or the prisoner\t.....No matter what the charge ..... the principle that the prosecution must prove the guilt of\tthe prisoner is part of the common law of England\tand no attempt to whittle it down can be enter- tained. XX\t\t\t XX\t\t\t XX XX\t\t\t XX\t\t\t XX In many cases, however, the accused's defence will involve introducing new issues, for example, automatism, provoca- tion, self-defence, duress, etc. Once there is any evidence to support such \"explanations\" the onus of disproving\tthem rests upon the prosecution. The accused, either by cross- examination of\tthe prosecution witnesses or\tby evidence called\ton his behalf or by a combination of the two,\tmust place before the court such material as makes the defence a live issue fit and proper to be left to the jury. But\tonce he has succeeded in doing this and thereby discharged\this evidential burden it is then for the Crown to destroy\tthat defence in such a manner as to leave in the jury's minds no reasonable doubt that the accused cannot be absolved on\tthe grounds of the alleged facts constituting the defence.\" Dealing\twith the presumptions of law, the author has noted on page 60, thus: \"Generally in criminal cases (unless otherwise directed by statute\tand subject to 4-15 ante) the presumption of inno- cence casts on the prosecutor the burden of proving every ingredient of the offence, even though negative averments b"

                "response-text": "reportable judgement of anwar p.v of supreme court ,latest judgement Anvar v. Basheer and the New (Old) Law of Electronic Evidence. The Supreme Court of India revised the law on electronic evidence. The judgment will have an impact on the manner in which wiretap tapes are brought before a court. The case On 18 September 2014, the Supreme Court of India delivered its judgment in the case of Anvar v. P. K. Basheer (Civil Appeal 4226 of 2012) to declare new law in respect of the evidentiary admissibility of the contents of electronic records. In doing so, Justice Kurian Joseph, speaking for a bench that included Chief Justice Rajendra M. Lodha and Justice Rohinton F. Nariman, overruled an earlier Supreme Court judgment in the 1995 case of State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu alias Afsan Guru(2005) 11 SCC 600, popularly known as the Parliament Attacks case, and re-interpreted the application of sections 63, 65, and 65B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (\u201cEvidence Act\u201d). To appreciate the implications of this judgment, a little background may be required. The hearsay rule The Evidence Act was drafted to codify principles of evidence in the common law. Traditionally, a fundamental rule of evidence is that oral evidence may be adduced to prove all facts, except documents, provided always that the oral evidence is direct. Oral evidence that is not direct is challenged by the hearsay rule and, unless it is saved by one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule, is inadmissible. In India, this principle is stated in sections 59 and 60 of the Evidence Act. The hearsay rule is both fundamental and complex; a proper examination would require a lengthy excursus, but a simple explanation should suffice. In the landmark House of Lords decision in R v. Sharp [1988] 1 All ER 65, Lord Havers \u2013 the controversial prosecutor who went on to become the Lord Chancellor \u2013 described hearsay as \u201cAny assertion other than one made by a person while giving oral evidence in the proceedings is inadmissible as evidence of any fact or opinion asserted.\u201d This definition was applied by courts across the common law world. Section 114 of the United Kingdom\u2019s (UK) Criminal Justice Act, 2003, which modernised British criminal procedure, uses simpler language: \u201ca statement not made in oral evidence in the proceedings.\u201d Hearsay evidence is anything said outside a court by a person absent from a trial, but which is offered by a third person during the trial as evidence. The law excludes hearsay evidence because it is difficult or impossible to determine its truth and accuracy, which is usually achieved through cross examination. Since the person who made the statement and the person to whom it was said cannot be cross examined, a third person\u2019s account of it is excluded. There are a few exceptions to this rule which need no explanation here; they may be left to another post. Hearsay in documents The hearsay rule is straightforward in relation to oral evidence but a little less so in relation to documents. As mentioned earlier, oral evidence cannot prove the contents of documents. This is because it would disturb the hearsay rule (since the document is absent, the truth or accuracy of the oral evidence cannot be compared to the document). In order to prove the contents of a document, either primary or secondary evidence must be offered. Primary evidence of the contents of a document is the document itself [section 62 of the Evidence Act]. The process of compelling the production of a document in court is called \u2018discovery\u2019. Upon discovery, a document speaks for itself. Secondary evidence of the contents of a document is, amongst other things, certified copies of that document, copies made by mechanical processes that insure accuracy, and oral accounts of the contents by someone who has seen that document. Section 63 of the Evidence Act lists the secondary evidence that may prove the contents of a document. Secondary evidence of documentary content is an attempt at reconciling the hearsay rule with the difficulties of securing the discovery of documents. There are many situations where the original document simply cannot be produced for a variety of reasons. Section 65 of the Evidence Act lists the situations in which the original document need not be produced; instead, the secondary evidence listed in section 63 can be used to prove its content. These situations arise when the original document (i) is in hostile possession; (ii) has been stipulated to by the prejudiced party; (iii) is lost or destroyed; (iv) cannot be easily moved, i.e. physically brought to the court; (v) is a public document of the state; (vi) can be proved by certified copies when the law narrowly permits; and (vii) is a collection of several documents. Electronic documents As documents came to be digitised, the hearsay rule faced several new challenges. While the law had mostly anticipated primary evidence (i.e. the original document itself) and had created special conditions for secondary evidence, increasing digitisation meant that more and more documents were electronically stored. As a result, the adduction of secondary evidence of documents increased. In the Anvar case, the Supreme Court noted that \u201cthere is a revolution in the way that evidence is produced before the court\u201d. In India before 2000, electronically stored information was treated as a document and secondary evidence of these electronic \u2018documents\u2019 was adduced through printed reproductions or transcripts, the authenticity of which was certified by a competent signatory. The signatory would identify her signature in court and be open to cross examination. This simple procedure met the conditions of both sections 63 and 65 of the Evidence Act. In this manner, Indian courts simply adapted a law drafted over one century earlier in Victorian England. However, as the pace and proliferation of technology expanded, and as the creation and storage of electronic information grew more complex, the law had to change more substantially. New provisions for electronic records To bridge the widening gap between law and technology, Parliament enacted the Information Technology Act, 2000 (\u201cIT Act\u201d) [official pdf here] that, amongst other things, created new definitions of \u201cdata\u201d, \u201celectronic record\u201d, and \u201ccomputer\u201d. According to section 2(1)(t) of the IT Act, an electronic record is \u201cdata, record or data generated, image or sound stored, received or sent in an electronic form or micro film or computer generated micro fiche\u201d (sic). The IT Act amended section 59 of the Evidence Act to exclude electronic records from the probative force of oral evidence in the same manner as it excluded documents. This is the re-application of the documentary hearsay rule to electronic records. But, instead of submitting electronic records to the test of secondary evidence \u2013 which, for documents, is contained in sections 63 and 65, it inserted two new evidentiary rules for electronic records in the Evidence Act: section 65A and section 65B. Section 65A of the Evidence Act creates special law for electronic evidence: 65A. Special provisions as to evidence relating to electronic record. \u2013 The contents of electronic records may be proved in accordance with the provisions of section 65B. Section 65A of the Evidence Act performs the same function for electronic records that section 61 does for documentary evidence: it creates a separate procedure, distinct from the simple procedure for oral evidence, to ensure that the adduction of electronic records obeys the hearsay rule. It also secures other interests, such as the authenticity of the technology and the sanctity of the information retrieval procedure. But section 65A is further distinguished because it is a special law that stands apart from the documentary evidence procedure in sections 63 and 65. Section 65B of the Evidence Act details this special procedure for adducing electronic records in evidence. Sub-section (2) lists the technological conditions upon which a duplicate copy (including a print-out) of an original electronic record may be used: (i) at the time of the creation of the electronic record, the computer that produced it must have been in regular use; (ii) the kind of information contained in the electronic record must have been regularly and ordinarily fed in to the computer; (iii) the computer was operating properly; and, (iv) the duplicate copy must be a reproduction of the original electronic record. Sub-section (4) of section 65B of the Evidence Act lists additional non-technical qualifying conditions to establish the authenticity of electronic evidence. This provision requires the production of a certificate by a senior person who was responsible for the computer on which the electronic record was created, or is stored. The certificate must uniquely identify the original electronic record, describe the manner of its creation, describe the device that created it, and certify compliance with the technological conditions of sub-section (2) of section 65B. Non-use of the special provisions However, the special law and procedure created by sections 65A and 65B of the Evidence Act for electronic evidence were not used. Disappointingly, the cause of this non-use does not involve the law at all. India\u2019s lower judiciary \u2013 the third tier of courts, where trials are undertaken \u2013 is vastly inept and technologically unsound. With exceptions, trial judges simply do not know the technology the IT Act comprehends. It is easier to carry on treating electronically stored information as documentary evidence. The reasons for this are systemic in India and, I suspect, endemic to poor developing countries. India\u2019s justice system is decrepit and poorly funded. As long as the judicial system is not modernised, India\u2019s trial judges will remain clueless about electronic evidence and the means of ensuring its authenticity. By bypassing the special law on electronic records, Indian courts have continued to apply the provisions of sections 63 and 65 of the Evidence Act, which pertain to documents, to electronically stored information. Simply put, the courts have basically ignored sections 65A and 65B of the Evidence Act. Curiously, this state of affairs was blessed by the Supreme Court in Navjot Sandhu (the Parliament Attacks case), which was a particularly high-profile appeal from an emotive terrorism trial. On the question of the defence\u2019s challenge to the authenticity and accuracy of certain call data records (CDRs) that the prosecution relied on, which were purported to be reproductions of the original electronically stored records, a Division Bench of Justice P. Venkatarama Reddi and Justice P. P. Naolekar held: According to Section 63, secondary evidence means and includes, among other things, \u201ccopies made from the original by mechanical processes which in themselves ensure the accuracy of the copy, and copies compared with such copies\u201d. Section 65 enables secondary evidence of the contents of a document to be adduced if the original is of such a nature as not to be easily movable. It is not in dispute that the information contained in the call records is stored in huge servers which cannot be easily moved and produced in the court. That is what the High Court has also observed at para 276. Hence, printouts taken from the computers/servers by mechanical process and certified by a responsible official of the service-providing company can be led into evidence through a witness who can identify the signatures of the certifying officer or otherwise speak to the facts based on his personal knowledge. Flawed justice and political expediency in wiretap cases The Supreme Court\u2019s finding in Navjot Sandhu (quoted above) raised uncomfortable questions about the integrity of prosecution evidence, especially in trials related to national security or in high-profile cases of political importance. The state\u2019s investigation of the Parliament Attacks was shoddy with respect to the interception of telephone calls. The Supreme Court\u2019s judgment notes in prs. 148, 153, and 154 that the law and procedure of wiretaps was violated in several ways. The Evidence Act mandates a special procedure for electronic records precisely because printed copies of such information are vulnerable to manipulation and abuse. This is what the veteran defence counsel, Mr. Shanti Bhushan, pointed out in Navjot Sandhu [see pr. 148] where there were discrepancies in the CDRs led in evidence by the prosecution. Despite these infirmities, which should have disqualified the evidence until the state demonstrated the absence of mala fide conduct, the Supreme Court stepped in to certify the secondary evidence itself, even though it is not competent to do so. The court did not compare the printed CDRs to the original electronic record. Essentially, the court allowed hearsay evidence. This is exactly the sort of situation that section 65B of the Evidence Act intended to avoid by requiring an impartial certificate under sub-section (4) that also speaks to compliance with the technical requirements of sub-section (2). When the lack of a proper certificate regarding the authenticity and integrity of the evidence was pointed out, this is what the Supreme Court said in pr. 150: Irrespective of the compliance of the requirements of Section 65B, which is a provision dealing with admissibility of electronic records, there is no bar to adducing secondary evidence under the other provisions of the Evidence Act, namely, Sections 63 and 65. It may be that the certificate containing the details in sub-section (4) of Section 65B is not filed in the instant case, but that does not mean that secondary evidence cannot be given even if the law permits such evidence to be given in the circumstances mentioned in the relevant provisions, namely, Sections 63 and 65. In the years that followed, printed versions of CDRs were admitted in evidence if they were certified by an officer of the telephone company under sections 63 and 65 of the Evidence Act. The special procedure of section 65B was ignored. This has led to confusion and counter-claims. For instance, the 2011 case of Amar Singh v. Union of India (2011) 7 SCC 69 saw all the parties, including the state and the telephone company, dispute the authenticity of the printed transcripts of the CDRs, as well as the authorisation itself. Currently, in the case of Ratan Tata v. Union of India Writ Petition (Civil) 398 of 2010, a compact disc (CD) containing intercepted telephone calls was introduced in the Supreme Court without following any of the procedure contained in the Evidence Act. Returning sanity to electronic record evidence, but at a price In 2007, the United States District Court for Maryland handed down a landmark decision in Lorraine v. Markel American Insurance Company241 FRD 534 (D. Md. 2007) that clarified the rules regarding the discovery of electronically stored information. In American federal courts, the law of evidence is set out in the Federal Rules of Evidence. Lorraine held when electronically stored information is offered as evidence, the following tests need to be affirmed for it to be admissible: (i) is the information relevant; (ii) is it authentic; (iii) is it hearsay; (iv) is it original or, if it is a duplicate, is there admissible secondary evidence to support it; and (v) does its probative value survive the test of unfair prejudice? In a small way, Anvar does for India what Lorraine did for US federal courts. In Anvar, the Supreme Court unequivocally returned Indian electronic evidence law to the special procedure created under section 65B of the Evidence Act. It did this by applying the maxim generalia specialibus non derogant (\u201cthe general does not detract from the specific\u201d), which is a restatement of the principle lex specialis derogat legi generali (\u201cspecial law repeals general law\u201d). The Supreme Court held that the provisions of sections 65A and 65B of the Evidence Act created special law that overrides the general law of documentary evidence [see pr. 19]: Proof of electronic record is a special provision introduced by the IT Act amending various provisions under the Evidence Act. The very caption of Section 65Aof the Evidence Act, read with Sections 59 and 65B is sufficient to hold that the special provisions on evidence relating to electronic record shall be governed by the procedure prescribed under Section 65B ofthe Evidence Act. That is a complete code in itself. Being a special law, the general law under Sections 63 and 65 has to yield. By doing so, it disqualified oral evidence offered to attest secondary documentary evidence [see pr. 17]: The Evidence Act does not contemplate or permit the proof of an electronic record by oral evidence if requirements under Section 65B of the Evidence Act are not complied with, as the law now stands in India. The scope for oral evidence is offered later. Once electronic evidence is properly adduced according to section 65B of the Evidence Act, along with the certificate of sub-section (4), the other party may challenge the genuineness of the original electronic record. If the original electronic record is challenged, section 22A of the Evidence Act permits oral evidence as to its genuineness only. Note that section 22A disqualifies oral evidence as to the contents of the electronic record, only the genuineness of the record may be discussed. In this regard, relevant oral evidence as to the genuineness of the record can be offered by the Examiner of Electronic Evidence, an expert witness under section 45A of the Evidence Act who is appointed under section 79A of the IT Act. While Anvar is welcome for straightening out the messy evidentiary practice regarding electronically stored information that Navjot Sandhuhad endorsed, it will extract a price from transparency and open government. The portion of Navjot Sandhu that was overruled dealt with wiretaps. In India, the wiretap empowerment is contained in section 5(2)of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 (\u201cTelegraph Act\u201d). The Telegraph Act is an inherited colonial law. Section 5(2) of the Telegraph Act was almost exactly duplicated thirteen years later by section 26 of the Indian Post Office Act, 1898. When the latter was referred to a Select Committee, P. Ananda Charlu \u2013 a prominent lawyer, Indian nationalist leader, and one of the original founders of the Indian National Congress in 1885 \u2013 criticised its lack of transparency, saying: \u201ca strong and just government must not shrink from daylight\u201d. Wiretap leaks have become an important means of discovering governmental abuse of power, corruption, and illegality. For instance, the massive fraud enacted by under-selling 2G spectrum by A. Raja, the former telecom minister, supposedly India\u2019s most expensive corruption scandal, caught the public\u2019s imagination only after taped wiretapped conversations were leaked. Some of these conversations were recorded on to a CD and brought to the Supreme Court\u2019s attention. There is no way that a whistle blower, or a person in possession of electronic evidence, can obtain the certification required by section 65B(4) of the Evidence Act without the state coming to know about it and, presumably, attempting to stop its publication. Anvar neatly ties up electronic evidence, but it will probably discourage public interest disclosure of iniquity."

Ans: It is given at the end of these answers. 2.I know she will contest the divorce in USA to get money and then will also try to get as much she can in India. What are my options? Ans: The divorce in USA is not maintenable if you did not surrender before US courts. Ex parte divorce decrees not acceptable and honoured by Indian Courts. Only if both the spouse attend and surrender then only such decree is acceptable. The marriage laws of India are unknown to US laws. As such your propos to bring a divorce case in India is appropriate. 3.Can false DV complaint and dismissal in USA help in quashing 498a charges in India? Ans: Defenately. 4.I do not plan to go to India any time soon. My concern is that my father, brother and his family live in India. My father has his property in India. I do not want them to be in any trouble when she files false cases in India. We have not travelled to India in last 4 years. There was never any transaction of money from my in-laws or wife\u2019s account to me. I do have proof that she sent money from USA to her parents. How to ensure my family in India does not get into trouble? Ans: If there is any threat of filing 498A false case then your siblings and parents can get anticipatory bail even before filing of FIR. Further you may try to file divorce in India through POA and assuring the court to go for video conference at the time of evidence which is acceptable by Indian Courts. ========================================================= It has however been seen that Indian laws have several loopholes that need to be identified. Below is a list of legal remedies that one can use for protection against section 498a IPC if a woman decides to misuse the law and threatens to register a false case against you for personal gains.   Collect all Evidence & Documents: The first step in proving a false accusation would be to gather all substantial material elaborating well on the 498a case details. You must start collecting as much evidence as possible, which includes:   Any conversation between you or your family member with your wife or her relatives like any SMS, emails, letters, call recordings, etc.  Any evidence that proves that your wife moved willingly out of your house. Any evidence that shows no demands for dowry were made before or after the wedding   Get an Anticipatory Bail: If you think your wife may file an FIR under Section 498A, hire a criminal defense lawyer and get an anticipatory bail to prevent yourself or your family member\u2019s arrest. Anticipatory bail is like a precautionary bail in case police move ahead to arrest you or your family members. You can file for anticipatory bail for protection against section 498a IPC case under Section 438 of CrPC[1].  Get the 498a FIR Quashed: You can also get the false 498A FIR quashed by High Court under Section 482 of CrPC. Courts are generally reluctant to quash an FIR or interfere in the law and order process, but if you have sufficient proof, the court has the power to quash the false 498A FIR filed by your wife.  File an FIR against your wife for false 498A complaint: You can also file an FIR against your wife for blackmailing or filing a false 498A case against you. Police in India usually do not favor such FIR, but if you make your case foolproof, the police cannot deny you to file an FIR against your wife. Get your complaint drafted by a good criminal lawyer so that the police cannot reject it on any grounds. If the police refuse to register your FIR, you can file a written complaint against the police officer, with the Superintendent of that police station.  File a defamation case against false 498A case: You can also file a defamation case against your wife for maligning your image by filing a false 498A case against you.   While fighting the 498a case, the duration of the case will depend largely on the evidence produced before the court and how efficiently your lawyer fights in the court representing your case."

                "response-text": "Dear Sir, My answers are as follows: 1.What are the steps that I should take in India to be prepared to fight a probable 498a complaint? Ans: It is given at the end of these answers. 2.I know she will contest the divorce in USA to get money and then will also try to get as much she can in India. What are my options? Ans: The divorce in USA is not maintenable if you did not surrender before US courts. Ex parte divorce decrees not acceptable and honoured by Indian Courts. Only if both the spouse attend and surrender then only such decree is acceptable. The marriage laws of India are unknown to US laws. As such your propos to bring a divorce case in India is appropriate. 3.Can false DV complaint and dismissal in USA help in quashing 498a charges in India? Ans: Defenately. 4.I do not plan to go to India any time soon. My concern is that my father, brother and his family live in India. My father has his property in India. I do not want them to be in any trouble when she files false cases in India. We have not travelled to India in last 4 years. There was never any transaction of money from my in-laws or wife\u2019s account to me. I do have proof that she sent money from USA to her parents. How to ensure my family in India does not get into trouble? Ans: If there is any threat of filing 498A false case then your siblings and parents can get anticipatory bail even before filing of FIR. Further you may try to file divorce in India through POA and assuring the court to go for video conference at the time of evidence which is acceptable by Indian Courts. ========================================================= It has however been seen that Indian laws have several loopholes that need to be identified. Below is a list of legal remedies that one can use for protection against section 498a IPC if a woman decides to misuse the law and threatens to register a false case against you for personal gains.   Collect all Evidence & Documents: The first step in proving a false accusation would be to gather all substantial material elaborating well on the 498a case details. You must start collecting as much evidence as possible, which includes:   Any conversation between you or your family member with your wife or her relatives like any SMS, emails, letters, call recordings, etc.  Any evidence that proves that your wife moved willingly out of your house. Any evidence that shows no demands for dowry were made before or after the wedding   Get an Anticipatory Bail: If you think your wife may file an FIR under Section 498A, hire a criminal defense lawyer and get an anticipatory bail to prevent yourself or your family member\u2019s arrest. Anticipatory bail is like a precautionary bail in case police move ahead to arrest you or your family members. You can file for anticipatory bail for protection against section 498a IPC case under Section 438 of CrPC[1].  Get the 498a FIR Quashed: You can also get the false 498A FIR quashed by High Court under Section 482 of CrPC. Courts are generally reluctant to quash an FIR or interfere in the law and order process, but if you have sufficient proof, the court has the power to quash the false 498A FIR filed by your wife.  File an FIR against your wife for false 498A complaint: You can also file an FIR against your wife for blackmailing or filing a false 498A case against you. Police in India usually do not favor such FIR, but if you make your case foolproof, the police cannot deny you to file an FIR against your wife. Get your complaint drafted by a good criminal lawyer so that the police cannot reject it on any grounds. If the police refuse to register your FIR, you can file a written complaint against the police officer, with the Superintendent of that police station.  File a defamation case against false 498A case: You can also file a defamation case against your wife for maligning your image by filing a false 498A case against you.   While fighting the 498a case, the duration of the case will depend largely on the evidence produced before the court and how efficiently your lawyer fights in the court representing your case."

                "response-text": "n Murikipudi Ankamma v. Tummalacheruvu Narasayya, AIR 1947 Madras 127, learned single Judge of Madras High Court held that in the absence of any express reservation of a power of revocation in the gift deed a donor does not continue to have the right to revoke a gift. For if a man will improvidently bind himself up by a voluntary deed, and not reserve a liberty to himself by a power of revocation, a Court will not loose the fetters he has put upon himself and without reservation of power to revoke, gift cannot be revoked under Section 126 of the Transfer of Property Act. 15. In Gandadhara Iyer v. Kulathu Iyer Sankara Iyer, AIR 1952 Travancore-Cochin 47, a Division Bench of the said Court held that when there is an out-and-out transfer by way of gift followed by a direction to the donee to maintain the donor the latter direction is only a pious wish. On the other hand, if the gift deed starts with a statement that it is made with the object of providing for the maintenance of the donor and this statement is followed by the operative clause, there can be no doubt that the gift is subject to the liability to maintain the donor. Thus, where after the operative portion of the gift deed other clauses providing for the expenses in connection with the donor's funeral ceremonies and for the services expected from the donee are introduced, the directions will not give any right to the donor to revoke the gift if the conditions are not observed. 16. In M. Venkatasubbaiah v. M. Subbamma, AIR 1956 Andhra 195, learned single Judge held that a gift subject to the condition that the donee should maintain the donor cannot be revoked under Section 125 for failure of the donee to maintain the donor firstly for the reason that there is no agreement between the parties that the gift should be either suspended or revoked: and secondly this should not depend on the will of the donor. Again, the failure of the donee to maintain the donor as undertaken by him in the document is not a contingency which could defeat the gift. All that could be said is that the default of the donee in that behalf amounts to want of consideration. Section 126 itself provides against the revocation of a document of gift for failure of consideration. If the donee does not maintain the donor as agreed to by him, the latter could take proper steps to recover maintenance etc. It is not open to a settler to revoke a settlement at his will and pleasure and he has to get it set aside in a Court of law by putting forward such pleas as bear on the invalidity of gift deed. Similar view was taken by Judicial Commissioner of Himachal Pradesh in Smt. Gaurju v. Tara Chand, AIR 1962 HP 4. 17. A learned single Judge of Orissa High Court in Tila Bewa v. Mana Bewa, AIR 1962 Orissa 130, has also held that gift cannot be revoked for failure of donee to maintain donor under Sections 126 and 122 of the Transfer of Property Act as there was no agreement between the parties that the gift could be either suspended or revoked. 18. In Union Bank Ltd. v. Mst. Ram Rati, AIR 1954 Allahabad 595 (Lucknow Bench), learned single Judge has held that a gift would be a valid gift if the gift has been accepted even though the document may not have been registered at the time of the execution of the document and it cannot be revoked subsequently, if the document has been registered. Further it is said that a completed gift takes effect from the date of the execution and not from the date of registration   A Division Bench of this Court in Smt. Shakuntla Devi v. Smt. Amar Devi, AIR 1985 HP 109, has held that if the gift not based on fraud, undue influence or misrepresentation its cancellation is not valid under Section 126 of the Transfer of Property Act. 20. In Vannathi Valappil Janaki v. Puthiya Purayil Paru, AIR 1986 Kerala 110, a learned single Judge of Kerala High Court has held that when a gift of immovable property has been accepted by the donees and they are in possession of the property the fact that after making the gift the donors felt that it was a folly or imprudence or want of foresight on their part to have executed the deed of gift will not clothe them with power of revocation of the gift under Sections 126 and 122 of the Transfer of Property Act. 21. Alearned single Judge of Himachal high Court in Mool Raj v. Jamna Devi, AIR 1995 HP 117, has held that when no specific condition of revocation has been made in the deed itself, in the event of failure of the donee to render services to the donor or maintain the donor the gift cannot be revoked under Section 126 of the Transfer of Property Act."

If AB is dismissed, but has been filed again, wait for the outcome, if it is dismissed once again, you may approach high court, which will be liberal in granting anticipatory bail on such cases.  If your brother has not married her, let him deny it during trial of the case.  3,Some said about quash petition in high court after getting bail.. and is this that big case ? You have to weight the probabilities depending on the nature of the prevailing circumstances.  4,And how do we probe for the photos originality ?

Yes, during trial, you can very well ask for its original format or at least the negative. 2, sec 420 also applicable to all of us.. ? Is that possible to exclude my mother and me from this case ? Or at least my mother as she ill. Take up the matter for quash before high court. 3,What evidence we should show to the high court to quash the fir?  It depends on what grounds or basis or documentary evidences you are in possession for seeking quash. 4,What all sections we can ask to quash?

The date of 6Dec2015 is handwritten on top of the page and the enclosed petition has a page missing.       Q1. What happens if I am unable to appear in the court on the date mentioned. I am unable to make reservations at such short notice and also unable to obtain leaves from office at the start of the year.       Q2. Am I allowed to put an application online or by a family member for a date in future. Or will the court issue a warrant against me or pass an ex-parte judgement in my absence.       Q3. Can we obtain the original copy or full copy of the allegations online by any means. Without having to appear in court on hearing date.       In the prayer/notice, the petitioner (my wife) has leveled multiple fabricated and baseless allegations.       Q. Do they come up for discussion during the said hearing? Or only during divorce proceedings?      In one of the allegations my wife had accused me of manhandling and verbal abuse when she came back to my home after a gap of about 4 months. Whatever shouting and disturbance of peace she caused was witnessed by my neighbors.       Q4. If I wish to include the testimony of my neighbors who witnessed this quarrel or those who have assisted in the marriage solemnization, how do I go about it? Can written statements like affidavits be made admissible as evidence in court?       Q5. Can I take a sworn affidavit from them to produce in the court during hearing of my divorce or interim maintenance hearings? And if yes in what format such an affidavit may be prepared. And can I make the accompanying cousin of my wife a respondent or party to the hearing, and how?      Q6. We are under constant advice from family & friends to give her a second chance and bring her home for the second time. Do it think it is advisable and if we have to do it, then what precautions to take prior to bringing her home or starting a dialogue.       Q7. Can we charge them with a divorce of other case with the grounds that the marriage was done with malafide intention of making money by means of alimony.   Q8. Can she now, after having lived separately for 10 months accuse me of dowry harassment or domestic violence and will court believe that?       Q9. In the court of Kolkata/WB is there any fixed amount to be paid to the wife as interim maintenance under this section? I have heard that in UP, the amount is Rs2000/- pm.",

Question =>Which of those cases are the ones in which police remand or arrest is possible? She can access maintenance case under section 125 cr.p.c besides 498A, 406, 3 & 4 DP act, and DV act case, if there was any altercation, she may file a criminal complaint under section 294B, 354, 506 IPC (if there were any injuries in the assault then section 323, 324 etc) .; Except for the complaints with police and the police registering FIR, no arrests will be made on other cases. Situation:- I have heard conflicting information regarding 498 being a non-bail able section of IPC.  Question =>Is it true; can the police initiate arrest or remand of my parents or myself? How to safeguard myself and my parents. Specially against a police remand, harassment or arrest warrant.  On receiving a complaint from her, the police will first summon all of them against whom the complaint is made, they shall inquire and take cognizance f the the complaint, if need be and after that the police may register a FIR and initiate action for remanding the accused. However sooner an information about the registration of FIR is received, you may obtain AB from the district court and then challenge her false case before the trial court.  Actually in your case the police has not taken steps for arrest because you have rushed up the police station before she could and have registered a police diary, hence the police is investigating the matter dutifully without making any formal arrests.  Question =>Is it advisable that I should I move my savings whatever they may be to some place untraceable.  Not necessary. You need not disclose your savings, even if she is mentioning about this, it becomes her duty to prove it with evidence. Question =>Can the court order a full statement of accounts as in how much saving I possess / have accumulated.  No, court will not pass any such orders on its own. She may file a petition seeking court to direct you to furnish the details, you may give a blank report stating that you do not have any, the court will not probe further on this matter, it will be her turn to prove her claims beyond doubt with documentary evidence. Question =>Can my wife or her lawyer using my residential address or name etc obtain a copy of my ITR or financial statements? She can apply for your ITR through RTI act. Question =>What happens to the items which are on the list but in real non-existent?  Just do not be bothered about the items which are not with you, make it a point to deny the possession of all such items which you do not. She cannot force you neither the police. Question =>Will she have an onus to prove their existence? Or will it be only on me to provide a proof of those being non-existent?  She has to prove it. Question =>Also, since I can attempt to prove the existence of a gift not the non-existence, how to go about this? You can in a reply give a list of items held in your possession and deny other items which are not with you. Question =>How to prevent or protect our own belongings to be brought under the ambit of streedhan? What do you mean by this?, Her own items shall be construed as Streedhan and not all those items in your home. Situation:- Current I am getting harassed by having to travel to Kolkata and my parents are old. Plus the leaves from my employer and cost of travel. Question =>Is it sufficient to have someone appear on my behalf with a Power of attorney? And if yes, till what extent or time.  For trial in the criminal cases, you cannot give a POA to somebody to represent you in the court. You have to appear, however during certain occasions you can ask your lawyer to represent and inform court abut your inability to attend the court. You ca also file a petition seeking permission of court to dispense with your personal appearance on the reasons and grounds stated under section 205 cr.p.c.      Situation continued::- Also I wish to be personally present during any arguments or cross examination.  Question =>How do I ensure that I don\u2019t have to appear for just any hearing but at the same time don\u2019t miss out on the important ones like cross examination or arguments etc?  For this you have to follow it up closely with your lawyer.  Situation:- Quite a few of the allegations in the case for maintenance and in the FIR are completely fabricated and baseless. Some of them can be actually proved to be malicious.  Question =>Can I bring the girl or her family to justice or ensure they be held accountable for perjury. If yes then when.  If she is making a false statement be swearing an affidavit before court and is proved o be wrong, you can take her into task by filing a perjury case under section 340 cr.p.c. Question =>What recourse does a male/husband have for wrongful persecution? You can file a petition against the police for malicious prosecution after being acquitted by court in the present case.  Question =>Is there any way I can plead to the court to arrange for a polygraph or Narco analysis so that all the lies that the girl has said about me and family can be brought on records. This test is not applicable to disputes arising out of matrimonial issues."

Appellant Versus Shanti Devi Sharma & Others .. Respondents JUDGMENT Dalveer Bhandari, J. 1. Leave granted. 2. This appeal is directed against the order dated 13th July, 2006 passed by the High Court of Delhi in Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 576 of 2006 and order dated 11th August, 2006 1 passed in Crl. M. A. Nos. 8093-94/2006 in W.P. (Crl.) No. 576 of 2006. 3. The question that arises in this case in narrow compass: Should part of the impugned judgment be expunged so that it may not adversely influence on an ongoing criminal investigation? The respondent filed a criminal writ petition number 576 of 2006 with the Delhi High Court. Vide this writ petition, the respondents sought a writ of mandamus that would direct the Commissioner of Police to take action against the appellant bank. Respondent no.1 alleged that her son committed suicide as a result of the manner in which the bank's recovery agents had repossessed her son's motorcycle. In the first information report (F.I.R.) dated 29.11.2005, the respondent alleged that on 16th October, 2005 at about 1.00 p.m., two recovery agents (referred to as \"goons\") forcibly entered her son's bedroom and started harassing and humiliating him for the loan payments that were overdue on his two wheeler and on his personal loan. 2 4. According to respondent no. 1, they repossessed the vehicle taken in the presence of his friends who ridiculed him for having lost the motorcycle. It is further mentioned in the FIR that the deceased had used his motorcycle to get vegetables for his small restaurant. It is also alleged that the deceased had to carry the vegetables on his back in the absence of his motorcycle. Upon finding the deceased carrying vegetables on his back, members of the neighborhood allegedly made snide comments. The deceased finally broke down before his wife and allegedly stated that he had never faced such a humiliation and disgrace in his entire life. On that very day, while his wife was washing clothes, the deceased went inside the small inner room and hung himself to death. We reiterate that this version of the events is found in the FIR and is thus an allegation at this time. 5. To ascertain the veracity of these assertions, the High Court ordered the Police to file reports as to the status of the investigation against the bank. The High Court later reviewed the 3 two status reports that were filed by the Police. It found them unsatisfactory and accordingly, the High Court directed the Investigating Officer to: \"conclude the investigation into the matter as expeditiously as possible and take necessary action against those who may be found guilty of abetting the deceased to commit suicide.\" Icici Bank vs Shanti Devi Sharma & Others on 15 May, 2008 In addition, the High Court stated that: \"Para 1: \"... the vehicle for which the loan was taken was repossessed by the musclemen employed by ICICI Bank. Para 3: \"...the proximate cause of death of the deceased that led him to commit suicide was on account of humiliation caused by the Bank people from where loan was taken by him.\" Para 4: \"The modus-operandi employed by the banks like ICICI for realization of their loan amount and for recovering the possession of the vehicle against which loans are given is extra legal and by no stretch of imagination they can be permitted to employ musclemen and goons for recovery of their dues even from a defaulting party.\" 6. The appellant bank claimed that it was aggrieved by the observations made by the High Court in paragraphs 1, 3 & 4 of 4 the impugned order. The bank asked the High Court to clarify or delete paras 1, 3 and 4. It did so by way of an application for impleadment as well as an application for clarification/deletion/modification under section 482 (saving of inherent power of High Court) of the Criminal Code of Procedure, 1973. According to the appellant bank, the observations made by the High Court were unjustified and unnecessary for deciding the case. 7. In an order dated 11.8.2006, the High Court declined to expunge the impugned observations because it had made them \"... consciously and there are no reasons to expunge the same.\" Nevertheless, the High Court clarified the matter by stating as under: \"However, it is clarified that any observation made against ICICI Bank in the order passed by this Court on 13.07.2006 shall not influence or affect the proceedings, if any, taken against the said bank or its employees.\" 8. Given that the investigation had not been completed, the High Court could have prefaced its observations by stating that 5 the facts were alleged. It did, however, note that \"... perusal of the complaint would reveal that the proximate cause of death ... was on account of humiliation caused by the Bank people ... .\" Reference to the \"complaint\" implies that its contents contain allegations, not facts. Moreover, the investigation was ongoing. Thus, it should have been understood that the High Court was referring to alleged facts. That said, the court could have been more careful to note that the facts that it discussed were alleged. Recognizing as much, the court clarified that its observations were not to influence or affect the proceedings. 9. We reiterate the same. They will have no bearing on the ongoing investigation. Given this clarification, we do not feel that the appellant bank has been substantially aggrieved. Nor do we believe that expunging the impugned observations would have much of an effect. Under either scenario, having the observations expunged or having them clarified, no one can rely on the observations. 6 10. As mentioned, the investigation is ongoing. Neither the High Court's order nor the observations made herein are to influence the investigation, save the time period in which it must be completed. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to remind financial institutions that they are bound by law. The recovery of loans or seizure of vehicles can only be done through legal means. 11. The Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (\"SARFAESI\") and the Security Interest (Enforcement) Rules, 2002 (\"SIER\") framed thereunder provide some of the procedures by which security interests may be recovered. In addition to SARFAESI and SIER, the Reserve Bank of India (\"RBI\") has promulgated Guidelines on the subject. The RBI  Practices Code for Lenders dated 5.5.2003 provides at (v)(c) that: \"In the matter of recovery of loans, the lenders should not resort to undue harassment viz. persistently bothering the borrowers at odd hours, use of muscle power for recovery of loans, etc.\" 7 12. A more comprehensive version of these Guidelines was recently released on April 24, 2008. The Guidelines expressly reference the 5.5.2003 Guidelines at (i)(x) with regard to the methods by which recovery agents collect on security interests. In addition, the April 24, 2008 Guidelines further referred paragraph 6 of the \"Code of Bank's Commitment to Customers\" (BCSBI Code) pertaining to collection of dues. The BCSBI Code at para 6 inter alia provides: \"All the members of the staff or any person authorized to represent our bank in collection or/and security repossession would follow the guidelines set out below: 1. You would be contacted ordinarily at the place of your choice and in the absence of any specified place at the place of your residence and if unavailable at your residence, at the place of business/occupation. 2. Identity and authority to represent would be made known to you at the first instance. 3. Your privacy would be respected. 4. Interaction with you would be in a civil manner. 5. Normally our representatives will contact you between 0700 hours and 1900 hrs, unless the special circumstances of your business or occupation require otherwise. 8 6. Your requests to avoid calls at a particular time or at a particular place would be honored as far as possible. 7. Time and number of calls and contents of conversation would be documented. 8. All assistance would be given to resolve disputes or differences regarding dues in a mutually acceptable and in an orderly manner. 9. During visits to your place for dues collection, decency and decorum would be maintained. 10. Inappropriate occasions such as bereavement in the family or such other calamitous occasions would be avoided for making calls/visits to collect dues. As noted above, this Code as well as others has been incorporated into the April 24, 2008 Guidelines: \"(ix) A reference is invited to (a) Circular DBOD.Leg.No.BC.104/ 09.07.007 /2002-03 dated May 5, 2003 regarding Guidelines on Fair Practices Code for Lenders (b) Circular DBOD.No.BP. 40/ 21.04.158/ 2006-07 dated November 3, 2006 regarding outsourcing of financial services and (c) Master Circular DBOD.FSD.BC.17/ 24.01.011/2007- 08 dated July 2, 2007 on Credit Card Operations. Further, a reference is also invited to paragraph 6 of the 'Code of Bank's Commitment to Customers' (BCSBI Code) pertaining to collection of dues. Banks are advised to strictly adhere to the guidelines / code 9 mentioned above during the loan recovery process.\" [emphasis supplied]. 13. RBI has expressed its concern about the number of litigations filed against the banks in the recent past for engaging recovery agents who have purportedly violated the law. In the letter accompanying its April 24th, 2008 Guidelines on Engagement of Recovery Agents, RBI stated: \"In view of the rise in the number of disputes and litigations against banks for engaging recovery agents in the recent past, it is felt that the adverse publicity would result in serious reputational risk for the banking sector as a whole.\" RBI has taken this issue Icici Bank vs Shanti Devi Sharma & Others on 15 May, 2008 seriously, as evidenced by the penalty that banks could face if they fail to comply with the Guidelines. The relevant portion of the Guidelines formulated by RBI is set out as under: \"3. Banks, as principals, are responsible for the actions of their agents. Hence, they should ensure that their agents engaged for recovery of their dues should strictly adhere to the above guidelines and instructions, including the BCSBI Code, while engaged in the process of recovery of dues. 4. Complaints received by Reserve Bank 10 regarding violation of the above guidelines and adoption of abusive practices followed by banks' recovery agents would be viewed seriously. Reserve Bank may consider imposing a ban on a bank from engaging recovery agents in a particular area, either jurisdictional or functional, for a limited period. In case of persistent breach of above guidelines, Reserve Bank may consider extending the period of ban or the area of ban. Similar supervisory action could be attracted when the High Courts or the Supreme Court pass strictures or impose penalties against any bank or its Directors/ Officers/ agents with regard to policy, practice and procedure related to the recovery process. 5. It is expected that banks would, in the normal course ensure that their employees or agents also adhere to the above guidelines during the loan recovery process.\" 14. We deem it appropriate to remind the banks and other financial institutions that we live in a civilized country and are governed by the rule of law. 15. Looking to the gravity of the above allegations, we expect that the matter will be investigated as expeditiously as possible and, in any event, it must be concluded within a period of three months and, thereafter, the concerned Deputy Commissioner of Police is directed to submit the report of the investigation in the 11 High Court. 16. In the facts and circumstances of this case we direct the appellant to pay costs of this litigation to the respondents which is quantified as Rs.25000/-. The costs be paid within three weeks. We direct that the matter be listed before the High Court after the report of the Deputy Commissioner of Police is filed. 17. This appeal is accordingly disposed of. ...............................J. (Tarun Chatterjee) ...............................J. (Dalveer Bhandari) New Delhi; May 15, 2008"

We went through marriage counselling to fix problems, but it never worked. I filed for divorce in September 2009 under the grounds of cruelty, because the girl did not want to sign mutual consent. The case at the family court finally concluded in October 2012, which went to the girl's favour. I appealed at the high court by February 2013.   The appeal at high court never progressed, still waiting for a response. At the same time, the girl and her family started harassing me and my family. They filed a case under section 7 (i) (c) against me and family, saying I took 2 kilos of gold and some money as dowry. They also attached my ancestral home with this petition.     Since you know my marriage ended in 2008 (we have no kids with this marriage), i moved on with my life and i feel in love with a girl. I live abroad now. My wife's family got to know about my lover and now they filed a criminal case against me and my lover and our families under section 494 r/w 34, saying that I married another girl while i am legally still married. Though its false that i got married again, now my life has gone for a complete toss. My lover and her parents are dragged into this, my old mother, my siblings. Now all of them are frustrated on me, because cops even went to their house to arrest.    We have now taken anticipatory bail for all relatives living in India, but our lawyer is not giving ideas as of how to handle this case. I am also frustrated that the matrimonial appeal in high court has not progressed though its been 2 years since i filed.    Can you please give some legal advise how to get rid of this mess?",

M.Ed,and was working in Gulamnabi Azad. College of Education, Pusad, Distt. Yeotmal(MHS). The husband Rajesh Jaiswal is sub?engineer serving in Pimampur factory.The order which is under challenge by itself shows that Mamta Jaiswal, the wifewas earning Rs. 4,000/? as salary when she was in service in the year 1994. Thehusband Rajesh Jaiswal is getting salary of Rs. 5,852/?. The Matrimonial Courtawarded alimony of Rs. 800/? to Mamta Jaiswal per month as pendente litealimony, Rs. 400/? per month has been awarded to their daughter Ku, DikshaJaiswal. Expenses necessary for litigation has been awarded to the tune of Rs.1,500/?. The Matrimonial Court has directed Rajesh Jaiswal to pay travellingexpenses to Mamta Jaiswal whenever sheattends Court for hearing of themmatrimorial petition pending between them. Matrimonial petition has been filedby husband Rajesh Jaiswal for getting divorce from Mamta Jaiswal on the groundof cruelty. This revision petition arises on account of rejection of the prayermade by Mamta Jaiswal when she prayed that she be awarded the travellingexpenses of one adult attendant who is to come with her for attendingMatrimonial Court. 2. Mr. S.K. Nigam, pointed out that the petition is mixed natured because ifat all it is touching provisions of Section 26 of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955(hereinafter referred to as Act for convenience) then that has to be filedwithin a month. Mr. Mev clarified that it is a revision petition mainly meantfor challenging pendente lite alimony payable by the husband in view of Section24 of the Act. He pointed out the calculations of days in obtaining thecertified copies of the impugned order. In view of that, it is hereby declaredthat this revision petition is within limitation, entertainable, keeping in viewthe spirit of the Act and Section 24 of it. 3. A wife is entitled to get pendente lite alimony from the husband in viewof provisions of Section 24 of the Act if she happens to be a person who has noindependent income sufficient for her to support and to make necessary expensesof the proceedings. The present petitioner, the wife, Mamta Jaiswal has made a .prayer that she should be paid travelling expenses of one adult member of herfamily who would be coming to Matrimonial Court at Indore as her attendant.Therefore, the question arises firstly, whether a woman having suchqualifications and once upon a time sufficient income is entitled to claimpendente lite alimony from her husband in a matrimonial petition which has beenfiled against her for divorce on the ground of cruelty. Secondly, whether such awoman is entitled to get the expenses reimbursed from her husband if she bringsone adult attendant alongwith her for attending the Matrimonial Court from theplace where she resides or a distant place. 4. In the present case there has been debate between the spouses about theirrespective income. The husband Rajesh has averred that Mamta is still servingand earning a salary which is sufficient enough to allow her to support herself.Wife Mamta is contending that she is not in service presently. Wife Mamta iscontending that Rajesh, the husband is having salary of Rs. 5,852/? per month.Husband Rajesh is contending that Rs. 2,067/? out his salary, are deductedtowards instalment of repayment of house loan. He has contended that Rs. 1,000/?are spent in his to and fro transport from Indore to Pithampur. He has alsodetailed by contending that Rs. 200/? are being spent for the medicines for hisailing father. And, lastly, he has contended that by taking into considerationthese deductions as meagre amount remains available for his expenditure. 5. It has been submitted that Mamta Jaiswal was getting Rs. 2,000/? as salaryin the year 1994 and she has been removed from the job of lecturer. No further details are available at this stage. Thus, the point is in a arena of counterallegations of these fighting spouses who are eager to peck each other. 6. In view of this, the question arises, as to in what way Section 24 of theAct has to be interpreted: Whether a spouse who has capacity of earning butchooses to remain idle, should be permitted to saddle other spouse with his orher expenditure ? Whether such spouse should be permitted to get pendente litealimony at higher rate from other spouse in such condition ? According to me,Section 24 has been enacted for the purpose of providing a monetary assistanceto such spouse who is incapable of supporting himself Or herself inspite ofsincere efforts made by him or herself. A spouse who is well qualified to getthe service immediately with less efforts is not expected to remain idle tosqueeze out, to milk out the other spouse by relieving him of his or her ownpurse by a cut in the nature of pendente lite alimony. The law does not expectthe increasing number of such idle persons who by remaining in the arena oflegal battles, try to squeeze out the adversory by implementing the provisionsof law suitable to their purpose. In the present case Mamta Jaiswal is a wellqualified woman possessing qualification like M.Sc. M.C. M.Ed. Till 1994 she wasserving in Gulamnabi Azad Education College. It impliedly means that she waspossessing sufficient experience. How such a lady can remain without service ?It really puts a bug question which is to be answered by Mamta Jaiswal withsufficient congent and believable evidence by proving that in spite ofsufficient efforts made by her, she was not able to get service and, therefore,she is unable to support herself. A lady who is fighting matrimonial petitionfiled for divorce, cannot be permitted to sit idle and to put her burden on thehusband for demanding pendente lite alimony from him during pendency of suchmatrimonial petition. Section 24 is not meant for creating an army of such idlepersons who would be sitting idle waiting for a \u2019dole\u2019 to be awarded by herhusband who has got a grievance against her and who has gone to the Court forseeking a relief against her. The case may be vice verssa also. If a husbandwell qualified, sufficient enough to earn, site idle and puts his burden on thewife and waits for a \u2019dole\u2019 to be awarded by remaining entangled in litigation.That is also not permissible. The law does not help indolents as well idles soalso does not want an army of self made lazy idles. Everyone has to earn for thepurpose of maintenance of himself or herself, atleast, has to make sincereefforts in that direction. If this criteria is not applied, if this attitude isnot adopted, there would be a tendency growing amongst such litigants to prolongsuch litigation and to milk out the adversory who happens to be a spouse, oncedear but far away after an emerging of litigation. If such army is permitted toremain in existence, there would be no sincere efforts of amicable settlementsbecause the lazy spouse would be very happy to fight and frustrate the effortsof amicable settlement because he would be reaping the money in the nature ofpendente lite alimony, and would prefer to be happy in remaining idle and notbothering himself or herself for any activity to support and maintain himself orherself That cannot be treated to be aim, goal of Section 24. It is indirectlyagainst healthyness of the society. It has enacted for needy persons who inspite of sincere efforts and sufficient effort are unable to support andmaintain themselves and are required to fight out the litigation jeopardisingtheir hard earned income by toiling working hours. 7. In the present case, wife Mamta Jaiswal, has been awarded Rs. 800/? permonth as pendente lite alimony and has been awarded the relief of beingreimbursed from husband whenever she makes a trip to Indore from Pusad, Distt.Yeotmal for attending Matrimonial Court for date of hearing. She is wellqualified woman once upon time abviously serving as lecturer in EducationCollege. How she can be equated with a gullible woman of village ? Needless topoint out that a woman who is educated herself with Master\u2019s degree in Science,Masters Degree in Education,. would not feel herself alone in travelling fromPusad to Indore, when atleast a bus service is available as mode of transport.The sumbission made on behalf of Mamta, the wife, is not palatable anddigestable. This smells of oblique intention of putting extra financial burdenon the husband. Such attempts are to be discouraged. In fact, well qualified spouses desirous of remaining idle, not makingefforts for the purpose of finding out a source of livelihood, have to bediscouraged, if the society wants to progress. The spouses who are quarellingand coming to the Court in respect of matrimonial disputes, have to be guidedfor the purpose of amicable settlement as early as possible and, therefore,grant of luxurious, excessive facilities by way of pendente lite alimony andextra expenditure has to be discouraged. Even then, if the spouses do not thinkof amicable settlement, the Matrimonial Courts should dispose of the matrimonialpetitiorisas early as possible. The Matrimonial Courts have to keep it in mindthat the quarells between the spouses create dangerous impact on minds of theiroffsprings of such wedlocks. The offsprings do not understand as to where theyshould see ? towards father or towards mother ? By seeing them both fighting,making allegations against each other, they get bewildered. Such bewilderednessand loss of affection of parents is likely to create a trauma on their minds andbrains. This frustration amongst children of tender ages is likely to createcomplications which would ruin their future. They cannot be exposed to suchdanger on account of such fighting parents. 9. In the present case the husband has not challenged the order. Therefore,no variation or modification in it is necessary though this revision petitionstands dismissed. The Matrimonial Court is hereby directed to decide thematrimonial petition which is pending amongst these two spouses as early aspossible. The Matrimonial Court is directed to submit monthwise report about theprogress of the said matrimonial petition to this Court so as to secure acontinuous, unobstructed progress of matrimonial petition. No order as to costs.The amount of pendente lite alimony payable to Mamta Jaiswal by husband RajeshJaiswal should be deposited by him within a month by counting the date from thedate of order. The failure on this aspect would result in dismissal of hismatrimonial petition. He should continue payment of Rs. 400/? per month to hisdaughter Ku. Diksha Jaiswal right from the date of presentation of applicationof her maintenance i.e. 14.5.1998. That has to be also deposited within a month.He may take out sufficient money for that from his savings or take a loan fromsome good concern or loan granting agencies. Failure in this aspect also wouldresult in dismissal of his petition. C"

The practice is widely regarded as unethical, and in many jurisdictions is illegal. If, the telephonic conversation is recorded by a third party without consent of participants. It is illegal, as it infringes Right to privacy. ( PUCL v. Union of India, 1997, AIR1997SC568 in this regard said that telephonic conversations are an important part of a person's private life, and people do have a right to hold private conversations in the privacy of their homes or offices.). Eavesdropping is not the solution for this. In fact you cannot prove her acts of infidelity or extramarital affairs by just producing such evidences, these evidences are not admissible as primary evidence by court of law. You can file a divorce case on the grounds of cruelty by citing this also as one of the reasons for which you dont have to produce the documentary evidences."

In fact if you want to use this evidence to support your claim or establish your allegations against her then you may adopt the procedures as laid down in section 65B of Indian Evidence act.   It is legal, although the evidence has been obtained involuntarily it can be still treated as a credible piece of evidence as per Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. However, the person against whom such an evidence is being used has to be given an opportunity to contest the nature and contents of a recorded conversation.The most common strategy adopted against such evidence is analysis of voice pattern.The person against whom such evidence is given can ask for matching the voice pattern in the recorded call with his voice sample.Furthermore, in order to match the 2 samples, the court can seek an opinion from the \u2018Experts in this field\u2019 by exercising the power under Section 45 in The Indian Evidence Act, 1872. Thereafter, based on the report submitted by the \u2018experts\u2019, the court can weigh the evidence presented before it, in order to arrive at a conclusion. There have been instances and allegations of presenting doctored or tampered evidence of electronic nature during lawsuits in order to falsely implicate a person.Hence, the evidence submitted under Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act is subject to further examination under Section 45 of the Indian Evidence Act in order to establish the guilt \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019."

But as per Bylaw No 38 of the 2013 model society bylaws framed under the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, read with circular dated August 9, 2001, issued by the government of Maharashtra. The aforesaid Bylaw No 38 and circular dated August 9, 2001, unequivocally state that the premium fixed by the society for the transfer of flats, cannot exceed a sum of Rs 25,000. Though the ceiling is Rs. 25,000 the society would pressurise the members to pay the exorbitantly demanded amount as voluntary donation. There may not be any resolution passed in this regard, even the bylaws would be silent on this subject, but the society would exploit the urgent situation of the seller and buyer may take advantage of this by placing the so called exorbitant demand.  Further, the Bombay High Court, in the Alankar Sahkari case, recognised that in a situation where a flat purchaser wants a smooth transaction and transfer of the share certificate in his name, the society enjoys a dominant position. Under such circumstances, the society demands payment of exorbitant amounts from the flat purchaser, under the garb of \u2018voluntary donations\u2019. While the legal recourse and law has been fairly settled, the question that remains, is whether a flat purchaser is willing to initiate acrimonious litigation with a society where he or she hopes to stay for the foreseeable future. However, in societies where presently there is no resolution with respect to charging of transfer premium as voluntary donations or otherwise, members should oppose the passing of any such resolution, as it is against the spirit of the law. Such acts can only be stopped, if members raise their objections at the right time."

        "query-title": "Housing association has raised an AMC demand without an AGM",
        "query-text": "Dear Sir/ Madam,     The housing association I live in is in Bangalore and is registered under KSRA. The last AGM (for the year 2016-2017) was held on 31st July 2016 with a followup EGM on January 2017 (increasing the AMC rate for 2016-2017). The AGM for this year (2017-2018) has not yet been scheduled, but the managing committee has already issued an AMC (Annual Maintenance Charge) demand for 2017-2018 and also threatened to levy a penalty on anyone who does not pay within 25 days of the demand.        When asked the Managing Committee have responded with \"An EGM or AGM decides the AMC applicable for the year and until another AGM or EGM revises it , the previously decided AMC remains valid\".and are using this as justification to carryover and use previous year's AMC this year. My understanding is that the AMC decided is for a fixed time period (last year's AMC is valid for 2016-2017 and is minuted as such) and cannot be carried over to this year, without majority approval in the AGM for 2017-2018.        Given your experience and expertise in the laws and bye-laws of the KSRA and KAOA, could you help us in this matter by answering the following questions?      1) Is the association's.demand for AMC without holding an AGM, without presenting the accounts for previous year and without presenting the budget for this year valid and legal? Is the AGM not essential to authorize the AMC? If for any reason the AGM for this financial year gets skipped, will the AMC decided for 2016-2017 be valid till next year's AGM?   2) The association has threatened a penalty for non-payment of AMC demanded. Given the current context, is that legal and enforceable? A penalty of 1% on non-payment of dues was decided in one of the past AGM's, but given that this year's AMC demand is raised without an AGM, can the penalty be enforced?   3) If a member requests details of the incomes, expenditures and the sinking fund, by when should the information be made available to him/ her? A week? 15 days?   4) Should the managing committee share with members and residents information on the statement of accounts, incomes, expenditures, sinking fund and planned budget for the ensuing year while calling for an AGM? Right now, all we get is a notice for the AGM with financial information being shared only in the AGM. A printed record of financial information is passed around in the AGM for 2 - 3 minutes and we barely have time to make understand the details, before it is taken back.       We have had problems in the past, with the managing committee trying to unilaterally take financial decisions without the proper forum of AGM/ EGM and hence we take a cautious approach to matters affecting the residents financially.     Answers to these queries will help us decide the way forward and your advice is invaluable in this regard.",

                "response-text": "Dear Sir, If joining new Company gives you more profits then immediately join it without waiting for 3 months period. The previous employer cannot do anything against you and be assured that most of the employers afraid of approaching civil courts on such issues. The law is on this issue is as follows: ================================================================== Is notice period (3 months) legal in India? It can be easily understood that the ambit and scope of section 23 of the Indian contract act 1872, is vast and therefore the applicability of its provisions is subject to scrutiny by the court of the consideration and object of an agreement and the agreement itself. Therefore, in order to bring a case within the purview of section 23, it is necessary to show that the object of the agreement or consideration of the agreement or the agreement itself is unlawful. I'll keep it short and simple:   Either party - employer or employee can terminate the contract by giving sufficient notice or compensating accordingly. In such a case, employer is bound to release the employee without any fuss, assuming that either of the above two conditions are met.   So, if your organization doesn't allow you to buyout the notice period, please feel free to knock on the doors of the Indian judiciary. The following key issues should be highlighted: \u2022\tA 30 to 90-day notice period applies in order to terminate \u2018workmen\u2019 (as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947) \u2013 that is, employees whose role is not primarily supervisory, administrative or managerial) for convenience, with 15 days\u2019 pay due for every year worked. In the case of manufacturing units, plantations and mines with 100 or more workmen, termination for convenience requires prior government approval; in other sectors, it requires only government notification. \u2022\tTermination for cause does not include non-performance \u2013 it includes only behaviour which qualifies as misconduct. \u2022\tThe \u2018last in, first out\u2019 principle requires that the employer first terminate for convenience the last people to join the organisation in the same role. However, this requirement can be contracted out of. When hiring for the same role, workmen who were terminated for convenience should be given the opportunity to re-join the company. \u2022\tState laws generally provide for about 15 days of earned/regular leave a year. Employees also benefit from up to 10 days of sick leave and a possible 10 additional days of \u2018casual leave\u2019. This is generally more than what most organisations would ideally like to provide. \u2022\tMost state laws provide for \u2018casual leave\u2019 \u2013 the employee can opt not to come to work that day without applying for leave in advance. Many organisations find this disruptive. \u2022\tMost state laws restrict women from working at night; if women are to work at night, specific approval must be obtained. This exemption is granted only to limited business sectors (eg, IT sector). Further, the employer must offer door-to-door transport and meet some security-related requirements. \u2022\tMost state laws prescribe overtime for any hours worked beyond 48 hours in a week. However, this is seldom observed. \u2022\tIndian law regulates and in some cases prohibits the use of contract workers. To engage contract workers, the contractor must hold a licence and the employer must be registered as a \u2018principal employer\u2019. \u2022\tNon-compete agreements are not enforceable under Indian law, while non-solicitation clauses can be enforced only in limited ways. \u2022\tWhile the \u2018work for hire\u2019 principle applies under the Indian copyright regime, it does not apply under the Indian patent regime; employees must thus provide formal assignments. \u2022\tIndian laws require employers to maintain a plethora of registers and notices. Compliance with such requirements is difficult and full compliance is rare.  What do you consider unique to those doing business in your country? Some of the points mentioned above are unique to India. In addition, while Indian employment law is mainly federal in nature, most states have a Shops and Establishments Act. These statutes are similar, but not identical. Further, some states have been permitted to make amendments to central laws, with which are thus applicable in a different manner in such states. Is there any general advice you would give in the employment area? India is heavily regulated in the employment arena. Legal assistance should be obtained with regard to employment contracts and employment terms of service. Practical advice should be sought on best practices and common practices, so that policies are HR friendly and legally compliant. Advice should also be obtained on areas where compliance is difficult, so that employers can adopt positions that balance convenience against risk. Emerging issues/hot topics/proposals for reform Are there any noteworthy proposals for reform in your jurisdiction? As part of the objective to make it easier to do business in India, the government has proposed that the federal labour laws be revised and possibly amalgamated into two or three labour codes. If this is accomplished, the filing requirements will be streamlined. Amendments have also been proposed to some federal laws relating to factories and the use of apprentices. There has been no progress taking these initiatives forward and it appears unlikely that the government will do so.  Key amendments to law in recent months include a substantial change to the Maternity Benefit Act 1961 through the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act 2016. Key features of this amendment include: \u2022\tan increase in paid time off for eligible female employees from 12 weeks to 26 weeks in case a female employee has fewer than two children. If she has two or more children, she is entitled to 12 weeks\u2019 leave; \u2022\tthe introduction of the concepts of a 'commissioning mother' and an 'adopting mother', which widens the scope of the law. Such mothers are entitled to 12 weeks\u2019 leave; \u2022\tthe option to work from home once the paid maternity leave period has ended, based on an agreement with the employer; and \u2022\trequiring an establishment with 50 or more employees to set up a cr\u00e8che facility. Overall, the amendments are progressive in nature. From an employer\u2019s perspective, there will be greater financial implications due to the increased maternity leave payment and also the benefits to be paid to the new categories of eligible female employees.  In December 2016 the Employee\u2019s State Insurance Act 1948 was amended, increasing the salary or wages threshold for coverage of an employee to Rs21,000 (approximately $309) per month from the previous wage cap of Rs15,000 (approximately $221) per month. The act applies to commercial establishments and provides for social security insurance for employees in case of sickness. The amendment has led to higher employee coverage under the law. What are the emerging trends in employment law in your jurisdiction? After decades of the government and courts adopting a somewhat socialist mind set, there has been a shift to a more pragmatic, business-friendly approach. The old approach, which focused on unskilled and daily wage workers, has given way to a focus on India\u2019s growing service industry. There is heightened interest in rewriting the employment laws to make them more business friendly. India\u2019s newest employment law on the prevention of sexual harassment is also leading to an increased number of sexual harassment complaints and additional processes to be followed. Another important aspect is the move towards e-governance in the labour law sector. A new web portal launched by the government provides users with a unique labour identification number, facilitating online registration, the filing of self-certified, simplified and single online returns for specific federal laws, and a transparent labour inspection scheme on risk-based criteria. Some concessions have also been provided for start ups in terms of employment law compliances. The employment relationship Country specific laws What laws and regulations govern the employment relationship? Some states require that the employer prepare an appointment order for new hires, although this is seldom observed. There are no direct laws dealing with probation on a general basis in India, which is, however, a common practice. The (federal) Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act1946 (which is applicable to workmen), provides for a probationary period of up to three months. Certain states have built in the probation concept indirectly into their local laws, which ranges from three to six months. Ideally, a probation period should not exceed 240 days, as several statutory social welfare laws apply to employees who have worked for such period. The Industrial Disputes Act 1947 (applicable to workmen), prescribes that if certain terms of service change, notice must be given to the employee. It also prescribes requirements for termination for convenience, including notice and compensation. Who do these cover, including categories of worker? There are essentially two types of employer and two types of employee. Employers are either: \u2022\t\u2018establishments\u2019 \u2013 a term which encompasses all employers; or \u2022\t\u2018factories\u2019 \u2013 a term which typically encompasses manufacturing units. Mines are sometimes covered along with factories. Employees are either: \u2022\t\u2018employees\u2019 \u2013 a term which covers all employees in any kind of role; or \u2022\t\u2018workmen\u2019 (as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947) \u2013 that is, employees whose primary role is not supervisory, managerial or administrative.  In addition, certain state laws may exclude senior management employees from their scope of application.  Misclassification Are there specific rules regarding employee/contractor classification? Indian law regulates and in some cases prohibits the use of contract workers. To engage contract workers, the contractor must hold a licence and the employer must be registered as a \u2018principal employer\u2019.  Contracts Must an employment contract be in writing? Except in states which require an appointment order, Indian law does not explicitly require that an employment contract be in writing, although this is the typical practice followed by most employers. Are any terms implied into employment contracts? Certain legal terms are implied in the employment contract. A duty of care, a right to privacy and a duty to maintain confidentiality are implied in the employment contract. Are mandatory arbitration/dispute resolution agreements enforceable? Yes. How can employers make changes to existing employment agreements? Under Indian contract law, a contract requires the consent of both parties. Thus, the employer cannot unilaterally make changes to the employment agreement. Typically, compensation terms are set out in an annex to the agreement, which should provide that these will be subject to change from time to time. Standard terms of employment \u2013 such as working hours, vacation, benefits, security procedures and disciplinary procedures \u2013 are normally set out in the employment terms of service, rather than in the employment contract. The employment contract should state that these terms of service apply to the employee and will be subject to change from time to time. An employer cannot change specified service conditions (eg, compensation, grade classification and customary concessions) for \u2018workmen\u2019 (as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947) without providing 21 days\u2019 prior statutory notice and notice to the labour authorities. This should be considered when implementing changes to an employment agreement. Foreign workers Is a distinction drawn between local and foreign workers? A significant difference between local and foreign employees is evident in the law on provident funds, which is a type of pension. The threshold to qualify, the manner of deduction and the benefits are different for foreign employee, and differ further depending on whether the country of origin has a social service agreement with India. There are no other substantive distinctions between local and foreign employees. Recruitment Advertising What are the requirements relating to advertising positions? Under the Employment Exchange (Compulsory Notification of Vacancies) Act, 1959, if the state so requires, a private sector establishment with 25 or more employees must notify vacancies to specific employment exchanges. However, this is seldom observed. Background checks What can employers do with regard to background checks and inquiries in relation to the following: (a) Criminal records? While it is possible to conduct criminal background checks, this is extremely difficult in practice because criminal records are not digitised and are not consolidated nationwide. Accordingly, where a criminal background check must be carried out, this is typically done at the police station with jurisdiction over the employee\u2019s current place of residence or anywhere that he or she has lived for a reasonable period. (b) Medical history? Employees\u2019 medical histories cannot be accessed easily, since these are not digitised and there is no repository of medical records. Employee consent is required to disclose medical records to the employer. However, some employers require employees to undergo medical checks and have the diagnostic centre send the report directly to the employer. Subject to certain specific restrictions (eg, pre-employment testing for HIV is not permitted), there is no prohibition against this practice under Indian law.  (c) Drug screening? Indian law does not prohibit drug screening. (d) Credit checks? An individual is entitled to obtain information on his or her credit rating. The employer can also access this information, with the employee\u2019s permission and on providing necessary proof of identity. Access to credit rating information is more common in banks and financial institutions. (e) Immigration status? Indian law does not specifically require an employer to check the immigration status of a foreigner. Indian law does not prevent the employer from checking whether a foreign employee holds the necessary visa to work in India. If a foreign individual on an employment visa wishes to change employment to another company, he or she must leave India and apply afresh for a visa. The only exception is where the foreigner is changing jobs between a registered holding company and its subsidiaries or vice versa, or between subsidiaries of a registered holding company. In such case the foreigner may not need to leave India, provided that he or she fulfils specific criteria, including obtaining prior government approval for the change in employment. (f) Social media? There is no bar against conducting background checks through social media. (g) Other? The most common background checks undertaken are of educational qualifications. The employee must consent to this and the employer (or an outsourced provider) will then write to the relevant institution requesting confirmation. The institution may charge a fee for providing this information. Most institutions have a procedure in place in this regard.  Wages and working time Pay Is there a national minimum wage and, if so, what is it? There is no national minimum wage. However, the central and state governments can issue notifications on minimum wages in specific industries. The federal government has set the recommended minimum wage to Rs176 per day and advised state governments to implement the same. Are there restrictions on working hours? By and large, working up to nine hours a day is permitted, with a weekly limit of 48 to 50 hours. There are laws that restrict women from working at night (between 8:00pm and 6:00am). Some states also have a maximum number of hours of overtime that can be worked.  Hours and overtime What are the requirements for meal and rest breaks? Most state laws provide for a break of 30 to 60 minutes after four to five hours of work. In practice, it is typical to provide a one-hour lunch break in an eight-hour day.  How should overtime be calculated? Overtime is usually calculated at twice the rate of normal wages. State law defines what the term \u2018wages\u2019 covers; this typically includes basic wages plus normal allowances, but excludes any bonus component.  What exemptions are there from overtime? There are no exemptions from paying overtime. However, the overtime provisions are seldom observed \u2013 generally, companies do not pay overtime when employees stay late to complete their work. It is recommended that employers pay overtime at least when employees are required by the nature of the assignment to work overtime \u2013 for example, call centre employees. Is there a minimum paid holiday entitlement? Yes. This varies from state to state, but is generally about 15 days. Most states prescribe up to 10 days of sick leave and some states prescribe another entitlement of up to 10 days of casual leave. In addition, most states prescribe about 10 days of public holidays; four to five of these are mandatory national and state holidays, while the remainder are chosen by the employer from a larger list provided by the state. What are the rules applicable to final pay and deductions from wages? Final pay must be made within two days of the date of termination where the employee\u2019s services are terminated by the employer. In case of the employee\u2019s resignation, the final pay-out can be made as part of the company\u2019s normal payment cycle. Deductions are permitted from an employee\u2019s wages, but only for specified reasons (eg, on account of fines, deductions for damage to or loss of goods expressly entrusted to the employee and recovery of loans or advances). Deductions are generally permitted only up to 50% of the employee\u2019s wages."

Indian law is therefore very clear and strict on this point, any such non compete agreement shall not be binding on the parties and the same shall be null and void. By using the term void ab initio, for such type of agreements it has shown that it has kept such non compete clause in the agreements beyond consideration. Indian courts have also consistently refused to enforce post termination non compete clauses in employment contracts as \u201crestraint of trade\u201d is impermissible under section 27 of the Indian Contract Act-1872, and have held them as void and against the public policy because of their potential to deprive an individual of his or her fundamental right to earn a living. However considering the developed social, legal, and corporate circumstances, and the required confidentiality and the integrity of the employments, the judiciary has inclined its view towards giving some regard to the non compete agreements. In the case of \u2018Niranjan Shankar Golikari Vs the Century Spinning and Manufacturing Company Ltd.\u2019 , the Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court observed that-\u201crestraints or negative covenants in the appointment or contracts may be valid if they are reasonable\u201d. Further in one case - V.F.S. global services Pvt. Ltd Vs Mr. Suprit Roy, 2008(2) Bom CR 446, the Bombay High court established the principle that a restraint on the use of trade secrets during or after the cessation of employment does not tantamount to a \u201crestraint on trade\u201d under section 27 of the Act and therefore can be enforceable under certain circumstances. In the case of Mr. Diljeet Titus, Adv Vs Mr. Alfred A Adebare & Ors 2006(32)PTC 609 (Del), Delhi High court held that \u201cThe real test was the degree of employment control to determine whether it was a contract of service\u2026\u201d . Like these there are several other judgements of various High courts which have laid down certain tests or guidelines to check the validity and legality of imposition of restrictions on such non competing agreements.

Enforceability Of Employment Bond http://www.mondaq.com/india/x/237806/employee+rights+labour+relations/Enforceability+of+Employment+Bond 1 Central Inland Water Transport Corporation v Brojonath Ganguly, (1986)IILLJ171SC 2 Niranjan Shankar Golikari v The Century Spinning and Manufacturing Company Ltd, AIR 1967 SC 1098 3 IBS Software Services Group v Leo Thomas, 2009 (4)KLT 797 4 Section 73 of the Contract Act, 1872 5 Section 74 of the Contract Act, 1872 6 Nandganj Sihori Sugar Company Ltd v Badrinath Dixit, & Ors, AIR1991 SC 1525 7 Gujarat Bottling Co Ltd v Coca Cola Company, AIR 1995 SC 2372 8 MANU/DE/6554/2011 9 MANU/AP/0416/2011 Introduction The present era is experiencing phenomenal changes in the economy and industrial processes, which has resulted in greater business competition. To cope up with competition, the employers incur huge expenditure in imparting training to their employees for improving the quality of goods and services of the company. However, sometimes the employees leave their employment after honing the skills & improving the knowledge of the industry for better salary and incentives. The increasing rate of attrition subjects the employers not only to financial losses but also delays in completing the ongoing projects thereby directly impacting their goodwill & reputation in the market. Therefore, in order to safeguard their interest, employers have of late started to obtain an employment bond from their employees who are found suitable for training or skill development. Such employment bonds are agreements between the employer and employee wherein among other terms & conditions of the employment, an additional clause is incorporated which requires the employee to serve the employer compulsorily for a specific time period else refund the amount specified as bond value. The question that arises here is whether such a method to retain employees is effective, acceptable and enforceable under the law. This article discusses the enforceability of employment bond and the rights available to the employers and employees under the agreement in light of various court decisions. 1. Employment bond: need and enforceability? Generally before selecting employees for providing training or skill enhancement program, employers take necessary safeguard of conducting interviews, take assurances that employee will stick to complete the projects for which he is being trained and shall also train the other co-employees so that an effective and efficient work environment is created. However, employees still tend to leave for greener pastures and, therefore, it is increasingly becoming necessary for the employers to enter into an employment bond to safeguard their interests. If employee leaves the employment without serving the company for agreed time period, the employer is expected to suffer due to the undue delay in completing the work undertaken, which can ultimately affect its reputation/creditability in the market. To prevent such situations, the employer can compensate the loss incurred if a valid employment bond has been executed. Such bonds also deter the employees from committing any breach of the agreed terms and conditions. Now, the most pertinent question that arises here is whether the employment agreement with negative covenant is enforceable under Indian laws? The simple answer is yes. Such employment agreements with the negative covenant is valid and legally enforceable if the parties agree with their free consent i.e. without force, coercion, undue influence, misrepresentation and mistake. The courts in India have held in its various judgments that in the event of breach of contract by the employee, the employer shall be entitled to recover damages only if a considerable amount of money was spent on providing training or incurred other expenses for the employee. Further, the courts have been reluctant to restrain the employee from joining a competitor/other employer. The employment bond will not be enforceable if it is either one sided, unconscionable or unreasonable. Therefore, it is pertinent to be cautious while drafting the employment bond because it is mandatory that the conditions mentioned in the employment bond, including the compulsory employment period and amount of penalty are reasonable in order to be valid under the Indian law. The term \"reasonable\" is not defined under the legislation and, therefore, the meaning has to be determined on a case by case basis depending upon the issues involved and circumstances of the case. In general, the conditions stipulated in the contract should justify that it is necessary to safeguard the interest of the employer and to compensate the loss in the event of breach of contract. Further, the penalty or compulsory employment period stipulated in the contract should not be exorbitant to be considered as valid and to be regarded as reasonable. 2. Challenging the enforceability of employment bond The validity/enforceability of the employment bond can be challenged on the ground that it restrains the lawful exercise of trade profession or trade or business. As per section 27 of the Contract Act, 1872, any agreement in restraint of trade or profession is void. Therefore, any terms and conditions of the agreement which directly or indirectly either compels the employee to serve the employer or restrict them from joining competitor or other employer is not valid under the law. The employee, by signing a contract of employment, does not sign a bond of slavery and, therefore, the employee always has the right to resign the employment even if he has agreed to serve the employer for specific time period.1 However, the restraints or negative covenants in the agreement or contract may be valid if they are reasonable. For a restraint clause in an agreement to be valid under law, it has to be proved that it is necessary for the purpose of freedom of trade. For instance, if the employer is able to prove that the employee is joining the competitor to divulge its trade secrets then the court may issue an injunction order restricting the employment of the employee to protect the interests of the employer. Whenever an agreement is challenged on the ground of it being in restraint of trade, the onus is upon the party supporting the contract to show that the restraint is reasonably necessary to protect his interests.2 In order to execute a valid employment bond, the parties have to ensure that the following requisites have been complied: (i) the agreement has to be signed by the parties with free consent; (ii) the conditions stipulated must be reasonable; and (iii) the conditions imposed on the employee must be proved to be necessary to safeguard the interests of the employer. Further, the employment bond stipulating conditions such as to serve the employer compulsorily for a specific time period or penalty for incurring the expenses is in the nature of the indemnity bond and, therefore, such kind of employment bond has to be executed on a stamp paper of appropriate value in order to be valid and enforceable.3 3. Remedies available to employer and employee In the event of breach of employment bond, the employer might incur a loss and, therefore, may be entitled for compensation.4 However, the compensation awarded should be reasonable to compensate the loss incurred and should not exceed the penalty, if any, stipulated in the contract.5 Usually, the court determines the reasonable compensation amount by computing the actual loss incurred by the employer having regard to all circumstances of the case. Even if the bond stipulates payment of any penalty amount in the event of breach, it does not mean that the employer shall be entitled to receive the stipulated amount in full as compensation on the occurrence of such default; rather the employer shall be entitled only for reasonable compensation as determined by the court. While exploring alternate remedies available to the employer in the event of default by the employee, it would be interesting and worthwhile to discuss whether the employers are entitled to seek for reinstatement of their employee or obtain restraining order against the employee from joining any competitor/alternate employer because many such similar reliefs have been sought by the employers in various suits. The apex court, while dealing with similar query, has held that the specific performance action cannot be sought for breach of contract of personal service or bond6 and, therefore, the employer shall not be entitled to seek for reinstatement of their employees as relief in the event of breach of bond. In another matter, the apex court has held that it is not bound to grant an injunction in every case and an injunction to enforce a negative covenant would be refused if it would indirectly compel the employee to idleness or to serve the employer7 and, therefore, the courts are also reluctant to grant injunction against the employees restricting their employment with other employer unless it is necessary for the protection proprietary interests or trade secrets of the employer. As mentioned, the conditions stipulated in the employment bond should be reasonable in order to be valid and, therefore, even if unreasonable condition/clauses are stipulated in the contract such as imposing exorbitant duration of compulsory employment period or huge penalty upon the employee, the court shall award compensation only if it determines that the employer has incurred loss by such breach of contract. The court normally considers the actual expenses incurred by the employer, the period of service by the employee, conditions stipulated in the contract to determine the loss incurred by the employer to arrive at the reasonable compensation amount. For instance, in the case of Sicpa India Limited v Shri Manas Pratim Deb,8 the plaintiff had incurred expenses of INR 67,595 towards imparting training to the defendant for which an employment bond was executed under which the defendant had agreed to serve the plaintiff company for a period of three years or to make a payment of INR 200,000. The employee left the employment within a period of two years. To enforce the agreement the employer went to the court, which awarded a sum of INR 22,532 as compensation for breach of contract by the employee. It is crucial to note that though the bond stipulates a payment of INR 200,000 as compensation for breach of contract, the judge had considered the total expenses incurred by the employer and the employee's period of service while deciding the compensation amount. Since the defendant had already completed two years of service out of the agreed three year period, the judge divided the total expenses of INR 67,595 incurred by the plaintiff into three equal parts for three years period and awarded a sum of INR 22,532 as reasonable compensation for leaving the employment a year before the agreed time period. Similarly, the High Court of Andhra Pradesh in the case of Satyam Computers v Leela Ravichander,9had also reduced the compensation amount considering the period of service of the employee. In view of the aforesaid discussions and various court decisions, the employment bond is considered to be reasonable as it is necessary to protect the interests of the employer. However, the restrains stipulated upon the employee in the said contract should be \"reasonable\" and \"necessary\" to safeguard the interests of the employer or else the validity of the bond may be questioned. The employees are always free to decide their employment and they cannot be compelled to work for any employer by enforcing the employment bond. The court can; however, issue order restricting the employment of the employee only if the said action is deemed necessary to safeguard the trade secrets/proprietary interest of the employer. In the event of breach of contract by the employee, the only remedy available to the employer is to obtain a reasonable compensation amount. The compensation amount awarded shall be based upon the actual loss incurred by the employer by such breach."

If your marriage has been registered after the engagement which has happened in between you and your husband then that is not as per the Hindu Marriage Act. Registration of marriage normally happens under the personal law through which you get married.  I genuinely believe that you are getting confused in between registration of marriage and court marriage. I think you have entered into court marriage after the engagement and that happens as per the Special Marriage Act and not as per the Hindu Marriage Act.  So you need to do following -  A. If your marriage has happened through court (that is through Special Marriage Act) then move an application before the court for the nullification of marriage stating that your consent was obtained through force/ coercion to enter in this marriage. If you succeed in this case then your marriage will be declared void and you will attain the status of Single and not Divorcee.  However to do this you have to do two things -  (i) You have to come before the court before August 2020, (ii) There should be no cohabitation in between you and your better half from hereon. B. If your marriage has been registered and it is not through Special Marriage Act which is Court Marriage then you have to come before the court under section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act seeking nullification of your marriage stating that your marriage is no marriage as it has not followed the normal mandatory course of marriage which is done as per the rites and rituals of Hindu customs. Besides your consent was obtained through force/ coercion. Similar results will come at the end of the day ie you will be declared single and not divorcee once this case gets heard in your favour. Likewise above in this case also you have to insure that you have come before the court prior to August 2020 and there is no cohabitation in between you and your better half from hereon. My best wishes to you."

Difference between nullity of marriage, divorce and judicial separation Some time people get confused with nullity of marriage, divorce and judicial separation. There is difference between these three. Nullity of marriage Nullity of marriage is a judicial declaration that marriage was not in existence. It refers to the validity of marriage according to law. It means that there was not a valid marriage has performed between the parties. Divorce Divorce is judicial declaration on the petition of the parties of marriage which led to the end of valid marriage. In divorce validity of marriage is not questioned but continuation of marriage is affected and there is end of a valid marriage. Judicial separation Judicial separation is judicial declaration on the petition of the parties of marriage to live separate under the status of marriage. It is not end of marriage. Duties and liabilities remain same towards each other. Nullity of marriage under different laws in India Nullity of marriage under Hindu law For the hindus according to smrities marriage is an essential sanskar. It is a duty of one to perform this. Marriage was indissoluble and and essential to perform religious and spiritual responsibility. Before the parliamentary enactment there was no concept of end of marriage or nullity of marriage under hindu personal law and marriage it treated as holy and strong wedlock for whole life. But after enforcement of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 there are certain grounds on which marriage shall be declared null and void. These grounds are given under Clause (i), (iv) and (v) of Section 5 of The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. These grounds are as follow:  If either party has living spouse at the time of marriage i.e. bigamy If marriage between prohibited degree relation unless customs and usage are allowed, If marriage between sapindas unless customs and usage are allowed such marriage   Sagotra marriage is valid under Hindu Marriage Act, 1955  There are voidable marriages also which are valid until declared null and void. Voidable marriage shall be annulled by the decree of nullity under section 12 of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. It is at the option of the parties to continue with marriage or to annul marriage by decree of court. Grounds are as follow  Impotency of the respondent Incapacity to give valid consent or forced consent of parties or mental illness or person unfit for procreation of child Under aged marriage If respondent was pregnant by some other person at the time of marriage.  Nullity of marriage under Special Marriage Act, 1954 Under section 24 of the Act on the petition of either of the party marriage can be declared null and void by the decree of nullity on following ground  Neither party has living spouse Incapable to give valid consent due to unsoundness of mind or mental illness or unfit to procreation of children Parties are under aged Parties are in relation of prohibited degree Impotency of respondent  There are some other grounds on which voidable marriage can be declared null and void.  Marriage has not been consummated due to willful refusal of respondent. If respondent was pregnant by some other person at the time of marriage. Consent of either party was obtained by fraud or coercion as defined in Indian Contract Act, 1872  Special marriage Act provides legal status and security to the interreligious marriage performed according to the provisions of this Act. Any person of any cast or religion may perform his or her marriage under this Act. Procedure for obtaining decree of nullity marriage Procedure is generally same in all personal law for obtaining decree of nullity of marriage. Petition for nullity of marriage shall be presented before court. The jurisdiction of court is decided where defendant or respondent has resides or marriage has solemnized or place where the party has last resized together. Then court issue notice to respondent or defendant to give reply before court. After hearing and evidence court grant relief accordingly. Under the parsi law court means court established under the Act. Under Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and Special Marriage Act, 1954 court is Family court or city civil court. Under the muslim law matter does not decided by court but matter decided by the religious practice."

First, you will be in a requirement of Legal Heir certificate issued by the revenue department. second, since your mentioned that you are preferring the family partition deed, it is mandatory to be registered. An instrument of partition (as a deed or otherwise) creating or extinguishing the rights in immovable properties of each heir in the immovable property is required to be mandatorily registered under Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908, and will also require appropriate stamping. As per the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, the correct stamp duty in Delhi is 2% of the value of the separated share or shares of the property. Third, if one of the legal heir want to relinquish their share for exclusive ownership, it is mandatory for its registration under section 17 of Indian registration act, 1908  to be a valid transfer under section 5 of Transfer of property act, 1882. Once all this is done, it will be a valid transfer without any ambiguities and will hold a perfect title for generations to come.

As per provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (Act), it is possible to claim a deduction for the interest paid on the housing loan under the head \"Income from house property\". Owning a house property in joint names has various tax benefits. However, it is important to note that the house property should also be funded by each co-owner. Also, the shares of the co-owners should be definite and ascertainable. Income-tax authorities are increasingly scrutinising the funding and allocation of shares of the house properties where the same is held in joint names and tax benefits are being claimed by more than one individual, especially when one of the individuals is in a lower bracket.  Since she is not a joint owner, if at all she wants to avail the benefits of income tax, then you may have to sell half the property to her by a registered sale deed. But will it be possible to sell the property during the existence of a home loan on the property. You can talk to the bank manager to give NOC to sell half share of property to your spouse who incidentally happens to be a co-applicant/co-borrower, without which it may not be possible for you both to avail the benefits of income  in this regard."

State of Punjab, reported in (1994) 3 SCC 569, the Apex Court held therein that \"the concept of speedy trial is read into Art.21 as an essential part of the fundamental right to life and liberty guaranteed and preserved under our Constitution\". In the celebrated case in Hussainara Khatoon & Ors v. Home Secretary, State of Bihar reported in (1980) 1 SCC 81, the Apex Court held as thus: \"No procedure which does not ensure a reasonably quick trial can be regarded as 'reasonable, fair or just' and it would fall foul of Article21. There can, therefore, be no doubt that speedy trial, meaning thereby reasonably expeditious trial, is an integral and essential part of the fundamental right to life and liberty enshrined in Article 21.\" Further, the Constitution Bench in the celebrated case A.R. Antulay & Ors. v. R.S. Nayak & Anr reported in (1992) 1 SCC 225, the Apex Court has laid down 11 propositions, which are almost the Magna Carta in the matter of fair and expeditious conduct of criminal trial. The said 11 propositions laid down by the Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in A.R. Antulay's case supra are as follows: \"(1) Fair, just and reasonable procedure implicit in Article 21 of the Constitution creates a right in the accused to be tried speedily. Right to speedy trial is the right of the accused. The fact that a speedy trial is also in public interest or that it serves the social interest also, does not make it any the less the right of the accused. It is in the interest of all concerned that the guilt or innocence of the accused is determined as  W.P.(C).No. 27197/14 - : 15 :- quickly as possible in the circumstances. (2) Right to speedy trial flowing from Article 21 encompasses all the stages, namely the stage of investigation, inquiry, trial, appeal, revision and re-trial. That is how, this Court has understood this right and there is no reason to take a restricted view. (3) The concerns underlying the right to speedy trial from the point of view of the accused are: (a) the period of remand and pre-conviction detention should be as short as possible. In other words, the accused should not be subjected to unnecessary or unduly long incarceration prior to his conviction;  (b) the worry, anxiety, expense and disturbance to his  vocation  prolonged investigation, resulting orfrom  and peace, an unduly  inquiry trial should be  minimal; and  (c) undue delay may well result in impairment of the ability of the accused to defend himself, whether on account of death, disappearance or non-availability of witnesses or otherwise. (4) At the same time, one cannot ignore the fact that it is usually the accused who is interested in delaying the proceedings. As is often pointed out, \"delay is a known defence tactic\". Since the burden of proving the guilt of the accused lies upon the prosecution, delay ordinarily prejudices the prosecution. Non- availability of witnesses, disappearance of evidence by lapse of time really work against the interest of the prosecution. Of course, there may be cases where the prosecution, for whatever reason, also delays the proceedings. Therefore, in every case, where the right to speedy trial is alleged to have been infringed, the first question to be put and answered is -- who is responsible for the delay? Proceedings taken by either party in good faith, to vindicate their rights and interest, as perceived by them, cannot be treated as delaying tactics nor can the time taken in pursuing such proceedings be counted towards proceedings or proceedings taken merely for delayingfrivolous delay. It goes without saying that the day of reckoning cannot be treated as proceedings taken in good faith. The mere fact that an application/petition is admitted and an order of stay granted by a superior court is by itself no proof that the proceeding is not frivolous. Very often these  W.P.(C).No. 27197/14 - : 16 :- stays are obtained on ex parte representation. (5) While determining whether undue delay has occurred (resulting in violation of Right to Speedy Trial) one must have regard to all the attendant circumstances, including nature of offence, number of accused and witnesses, the workload of the court concerned, prevailing local conditions and so on -- what is called, the systemic delays. It is true that it is the obligation of the State to ensure a speedy trial and State includes judiciary as well, but a realistic and practical approach should be adopted in such matters instead of a pedantic one. (6) Each and every delay does not necessarily prejudice the accused. Some delays may indeed work to his advantage. As has been observed by Powell, J. in Barker22 \"it cannot be said how long a delay is too long in a system where justice is supposed to be swift but deliberate\". The same idea has been stated by White, J. in U.S. v. Ewell38 in the following words: `... the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial is necessarily relative, is consistent with delays, and has orderly expedition, rather than mere speed, as its essential ingredients; and whether delay in completing a prosecution amounts to an unconstitutional deprivation of rights depends upon all the circumstances.' However, inordinately long delay may be taken as presumptive proof of prejudice. In this context, the fact of incarceration of accused will also be a relevant fact. The prosecution should not be allowed to become a persecution. But when does the prosecution become persecution, again depends upon the facts of a given case. (7) We cannot recognize or give effect to, what is called the `demand' rule. An accused cannot try himself; he is tried by the court at the behest of the prosecution. Hence, an accused's plea of denial of speedy trial cannot be defeated by saying that the accused did at no time demand a speedy trial. If in a given case, he did make such a demand and yet he was not tried speedily, it would be a plus point in his favour, but the mere non-asking for a speedy trial cannot be put against the accused. Even in USA, the relevance of demand rule has been substantially watered down in Barker and other succeeding cases.  (8) Ultimately, the court has to balance and weigh the several W.P.(C).No. 27197/14 - : 17 :- relevant factors -- `balancing test' or `balancing process' -- and determine in each case whether the right to speedy trial has been denied in a given case. (9) Ordinarily speaking, where the court comes to the conclusion that right to speedy trial of an accused has been infringed the charges or the conviction, as the case may be, shall be quashed. But this is not the only course open. The nature of the offence and other circumstances in a given case may be such that quashing of proceedings may not be in the interest of justice. In such a case, it is open to the court to make such other appropriate order -- including an order to conclude the trial within a fixed time where the trial is not concluded or reducing the sentence where the trial has concluded -- as may be deemed just and equitable in the circumstances of the case. (10) It is neither advisable nor practicable to fix any time-limit for trial of offences. Any such rule is bound to be qualified one. Such rule cannot also be evolved merely to shift the burden of proving justification on to the shoulders of the prosecution. In every case of complaint of denial of right to speedy trial, it is primarily for the prosecution to justify and explain the delay. At the same time, it is the duty of the court to weigh all the circumstances of a given case before pronouncing upon the complaint. The Supreme Court of USA too has repeatedly refused to fix any such outer time-limit in spite of the Sixth Amendment. Nor do we think that not fixing any such outer limit ineffectuates the guarantee of right to speedy trial. (11) An objection based on denial of right to speedy trial and for relief on that account, should first be addressed to the High Court. Even if the High Court entertains such a plea, ordinarily it should not stay the proceedings, except in a case of grave and exceptional nature. Such proceedings in High Court must, however, be disposed of on a priority basis.\" Later, due to conflict regarding the setting of outer time limit for conclusion of criminal proceedings in rulings of the Apex Court as in Common Cause Case reported (1996) 4 SCC 33 and Raj Deo Sharma (ii) reported in (1999) 7 SCC 604, the matter was considered  W.P.(C).No. 27197/14 - : 18 :- 3(Very Important) n the case Pankaj Kumar v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. reported in (2008) 16 SCC 117, the Apex Court has held in paragraphs 23 to 28 therein, that in every case where the right to speedy trial is alleged to have been infringed, the court has to perform the balancing act upon taking into consideration all the attendant circumstances and determine in each case, whether the  W.P.(C).No. 27197/14 - : 22 :- right to speedy trial has been denied in a given case. Where the court comes to the conclusion that the right to speedy trial of an accused has been infringed, the charges or the conviction, may be quashed, unless the court feels that having regard to the nature of offence and other relevant circumstances, quashing of proceedings may not be in the interest of justice. In such situation, it is open to the court to make an appropriate order as it may deem fit and equitable including fixation of time for conclusion of trial. In the light of these aspects, the Apex Court held therein that the appellant's constitutional rights recognised under Art.21 of the Constitution stood violated and that FIR was recorded on 12.5.1987 for the offences allegedly committed in the year 1981 and after unwarranted prolonged investigations involving three alleged financial irregularities, the charge sheet was submitted before the court only on 22.2.1991. That nothing happened till April 1991, when the appellant and his deceased mother filed Writ Petition seeking quashment of the proceedings before the trial court. Though the plea with regard to the inordinate delay in investigation and trial was raised by the appellant therein for the first time, their Lordships of the Supreme Court held that at that distant point of  W.P.(C).No. 27197/14 - : 23 :- time it would be most unfair to the appellant therein to remit the matter back to the High Court after examining the said plea of the appellant. Moreover, the learned counsel for the State fairly stated therein that he had no explanation to offer for the delay in the investigation and the reason why the trial did not commence for eight long years. Nothing could be shown to attribute that the delay was in any way caused by the appellant therein. The appellant therein was a young boy of 18 years of age in the year 1981 when the alleged acts of omission and commission were allegedly committed by the concerns managed by his parents, who had since died. The Apex Court observed that there will be extreme mental stress and strain of prolonged investigation by the Anti Corruption Bureau and the Sword of Damocles is hanging perilously over his head for over fifteen years, which must have wrecked his entire career. The prosecution has also failed to show any exceptional circumstance, which could possibly be taken into consideration for condoning the prolongation of investigation and the trial. In the light of these aspects, the Apex Court held that the valuable constitutional right of the appellant for speedy investigation and trial was grossly violated and therefore the impugned criminal  W.P.(C).No. 27197/14 - : 24 :- proceedings in that case were quashed.."

We are planning to submit our claim for mutation along with the following so that case can be settled at the District level without need to go courts which take enormous time.\t\t   Your legal opinion on the issue regarding   1. The validity of oral rental agreements in the absence of written agreement (with copies of recent judgements of Supreme Court or High Court of West Bengal)   2. Adequacy of evidence to prove our ownership in the form of payment of rent into our bank account by the school as proof that they are only tenants.   3. Payment of electricity bills to a utility provider is not proof of ownership of property   Your opinion on a letter head with rulings by the superior courts with copies attached may please be sent to my email address   Email [deleted]",

The legality, of an oral agreement, cannot be questioned, if it falls under the ambit of the requirements stated in section 10 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Deposit of rent into your bank is enough evidence to prove the tenancy."

        "query-text": "I belong to a middle class family in Durgapur, West Bengal. I have completed my masters from an Institute of National Importance. Presently, I am a research scholar in an institute of National Importance. I am well off with my fellowship.    My father is really abusive towards my mother and me. He throws slangs and create a tussle even in simple issues. Sometimes he takes resort to physical abuse. He behaves in a very unsophisticated way. He keeps on telling that I have digged out his money which he could have given to his nephews (who are unemployed but who had enjoyed much more financial and mental security than me) In this lock down period, I am confined to my home and cannot return to Institute. Its disturbing my peace of mind and bringing suicidal thoughts to my mind.     My question is that if I cut all my relationship with him, and go away elsewhere, then is it possible for him to force me to come back so that he can continue with his slang behaviour? I want to spend the rest of this lock down period in some far off, peaceful place until my Institute opens when I can return to hostel. Also, is it possible for him to tarnish my name in my Institute? If so, what are the steps I must take?   I have endured to this day, and if I go on enduring all these wrongs, I will be driven to suicide. So, I want to leave and think that I don't have parents.   I am a woman, 28 years old, and I don't have plans of marriage.",

Running from the battle field make you lose your strength. Believe the strength of law which continuously strengthen by constitution. The DV Act provides that the aggrieved person may approach not only the Magistrate but also the Civil court, Family court or any other courts and seek relief\u2019s including protection orders, residence orders,monetary reliefs,custody orders, and/or compensation orders. The D.V. Act has been enacted to provide a remedy in Civil Law for protection of women from being victims of domestic violence and to prevent occurrence of domestic violence in the society. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 is essentially a civil law, but the legislation has prescribed that courts have to proceed in such cases as per the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) for the purpose of effective actions. File a complaint against father before the near police station or file a petition under DV act. Think more use the law and protection awarded by constitution to citizens"

The RTI Act was enacted only to lay down the procedure for obtaining information since the substantive right to information was already recognized by the Supreme Court as a fundamental right of the citizens. Therefore, in my considered opinion, a government employee is equally entitled to get information under the RTI Act from his employers, since it is his fundamental right under the Constitution. Section 6 of the RTI Act lays down as under: \u201c6. Request for obtaining information.\u2014(1) A person, who desires to obtain any information under this Act, shall make a request in writing or through electronic means in English or Hindi or in the official language of the area in which the application is being made, accompanying such fee as may be prescribed, to\u2014 (a) the Central Public Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, of the concerned public authority; (b) the Central Assistant Public Information Officer or State Assistant Public Information Officer, as the case may be, specifying the particulars of the information sought by him or her: Provided that where such request cannot be made in writing, the Central Public Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, shall render all reasonable assistance to the person making the request orally to reduce the same in writing. (2) An applicant making request for information shall not be required to give any reason for requesting the information or any other personal details except those that may be necessary for contacting him. Hope the above convinces."
