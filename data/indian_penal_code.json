It is not necessary and indeed not permissible to construe the IPC, 1860 at the present day in accordance with the notions of criminal jurisdiction prevailing at the time when the Code was enacted. The notions relating to this matter have very considerably changed between then and now during nearly a century that has elapsed. It is legitimate to construe the Code with reference to the modern needs, wherever this is permissible, unless there is anything in the Code or in any particular section to indicate the contrary.2.",

The Court concerned can pronounce on such issues on the basis of evidence produced before it. There may be some overlapping of facts in the cases under section 420 IPC, 1860 and section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 but ingredients of offences are entirely different. Thus, the subsequent case is not barred.8. A \"terrorist act\" and an act of \"waging war against the Government of India\" may have some overlapping features, but a terrorist act may not always be an act of waging war against the Government of India, and vice versa. The provisions of Chapter IV of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 and those of Chapter VI of the IPC, 1860 including section 121, basically cover different areas.9. The mere fact that the offence in question was covered by the Customs Act, 1962 did not mean that it could not be tried under IPC, 1860 if it also falls under it.10."

'Every person'.—Every person is made liable to punishment, without distinction of nation, rank, caste or creed, provided the offence with which he is charged has been committed in some part of India. A foreigner who enters the Indian territories and thus, accepts the protection of Indian laws virtually gives an assurance of his ﬁdelity and obedience to them and submits himself to their operation. It is no defence on behalf of a foreigner that he did not know he was doing wrong, the act not being an offence in his own country. A foreigner who commits an offence within India is guilty and can be   punished as such without any limitation as to his corporal presence in India at the time.14. Indian Courts have jurisdiction against foreigners residing in foreign countries but their acts connected with transaction or part of transaction arising in India.15.",

Although there are earlier authorities to the fact that the corporation cannot commit a crime, the generally accepted modern rule is that a corporation may be subject to indictment and other criminal process although the criminal act may be committed through its agent. The majority in the Constitution bench held that there is no immunity to the companies from prosecution merely because the prosecution is in respect of offences for which the punishment is mandatory imprisonment and ﬁne.16. When imprisonment and ﬁne is prescribed as punishment the Court can impose the punishment of ﬁne which could be enforced against the company.17. In CBI v Blue Sky Tie-up Pvt Ltd,18. the question again came up for consideration before the Supreme Court and it was held that since the majority of the Constitution Bench ruled in Standard Chartered Bank v Directorate of Enforcement [supra] that the company can be prosecuted even in a case where the Court can impose substantive sentence as also ﬁne, and in such case only ﬁne can be imposed on the corporate body, the contrary view taken by the learned single Judge cannot be approved."

            "sub_section_description": "Indian Penal Code, save and except some matters does not contemplate any vicarious liability on the part of a person. Commission of an offence by raising a legal ﬁction or by creating a vicarious liability in terms of the provisions of a statute must be expressly stated. The Managing Director or the Directors of the Company, thus, cannot be said to have committed an offence only because they are holders of oﬃces.19. Vicarious liability of the Managing Director and Director would arise provided any provision exists in that behalf in the statute. Statutes indisputably must contain provision ﬁxing such vicarious liabilities. Even for the said purpose, it is obligatory on the part of the complainant to make requisite allegations which would attract the provisions constituting vicarious liability.20. The provisions of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, Employees' Provident Fund (Miscellaneous Provision) Act, 1952, etc., have created such vicarious liability. It is interesting to note that section 14A of the 1952 Act speciﬁcally creates an offence of criminal breach of trust in respect of the amount deducted from the employees by the company. In terms of the explanations appended to section 405 of the IPC, 1860 a legal ﬁction has been created to the effect that the employer shall be deemed to have committed an offence of criminal breach of trust. Whereas a person in charge of the affairs of the company and in control thereof has been made vicariously liable for the offence committed by the company along with the company but even in a case falling under section 406 of the IPC, 1860 vicarious liability has been held to be not extendable to the Directors or oﬃcers of the company.21. There is no exception in favour of anyone in the Penal Code, but the following persons are exempted from the jurisdiction of criminal Courts of every country:— (a) Foreign Sovereigns.—The real principle on which the exemption, of every sovereign from the jurisdiction of every Court, has been deduced is that the exercise of such jurisdiction would be incompatible with his regal dignity—that is to say, with his absolute independence of every superior authority.22.   (b) Diplomats.—United Nations Privileges and Immunities Act, 1947, and the Diplomatic Relations (Vienna Convention) Act, 1972, gave certain diplomats, missions and their member's diplomatic immunity even from criminal jurisdiction. The Diplomatic Relations (Vienna Convention) Act had been enacted to give effect to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, 1961. The effect of section 2 of the Act is to give the force of law in India to certain provisions set out in the Schedule to the Act. A diplomatic agent shall enjoy immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the receiving State. He shall also enjoy immunity from its civil and administrative jurisdiction except in the case of: (i) A real action relating to private immovable property situated in the territory of the  receiving State, unless he holds it on behalf of the sending State for the purposes of the mission; (ii) An action relating to succession in which the diplomatic agent is involved as  executor, administrator, heir or legatee as a private person and not on behalf of the sending State; (iii) An action relating to any professional or commercial activity exercised by the  diplomatic agent in the receiving State outside his oﬃcial functions.23. A diplomatic agent is not obliged to give evidence as a witness.24. Privileges and immunities are conferred on United Nations and its Representatives as well as on other international organisations and their representatives by the United Nations (Privileges and Immunities) Act, 1947.25. (c) Alien enemies.—In respect of acts of war alien enemies cannot be tried by criminal Courts. If an alien enemy commits a crime unconnected with war, e.g., theft, he would be triable by ordinary criminal Courts. (d) Foreign army.—When armies of one State are by consent on the soil of a foreign State they are exempted from the jurisdiction of the State on whose soil they are. (e) Warships.—Men-of-war of a State in foreign waters are exempt from the jurisdiction of the State within whose territorial jurisdiction they are. The domestic Courts, in accordance with principles of international law, will accord to the ship and its crew and its contents certain immunities. The immunities can, in any case, be waived by the nation to which the public ship belongs.26. (f) President and Governors.—Under Article 361 of the Indian Constitution, the President and Governors are exempt from the jurisdiction of Courts."

Article 1 of the Constitution of India deals only with the geographical territory while Article 297 deals with 'maritime territory'. Article 297(3) authorises the Parliament to specify from time to time the limits of various maritime zones such as, territorial waters, continental shelf, etc. Clauses (1) and (2) of the said Article make a declaration that all lands, minerals and other things of value and all other resources shall vest in the Union of India.29. Section 18 of the IPC, 1860 deﬁnes India as the territory of India excluding the state of Jammu and Kashmir. These territorial limits would include the territorial waters of India.30. Under the General Clauses Act, 1897, India is deﬁned to mean all territories for the time being comprised in the territory of India as deﬁned in the Constitution of India. Under the provisions of Article 297 of the Constitution of India, all lands, minerals and other things of value underlying the ocean within the territorial waters or the continental shelf or the exclusive economic zone of India vest in the Union. The Constitution of India does not itself deﬁne the terms territorial waters, continental shelf, and exclusive economic zone. Clause (3) of Article 297 states that their limits shall be such as may be speciﬁed by Parliament. In 1976, Parliament implemented the amendments to the Constitution of India by passing the Maritime Zones Act, 1976.31. Insofar the Republic of India is concerned, the limit of the territorial waters was initially understood to be three nautical miles. It had been extended subsequently; up to six nautical miles by a Presidential proclamation dated 22 March 1952 and to 12 nautical miles by another proclamation dated 30 September 1967. By The Territorial Waters, Continental Shelf, Exclusive Economic Zone and Other Maritime Zones Act, 80 of 1976, it was statutorily ﬁxed at 12 nautical miles. Section 3 of the Act stipulates that the sovereignty of India extends to the territorial waters, the limit of which is 12 nautical miles. Section 5 of the Territorial Waters Act, 1976 deﬁnes the contiguous zone of India as an area beyond and adjacent to territorial waters to a distance of 24 nautical miles from the nearest point of the baseline. Section 7 of the Act deﬁnes the Exclusive economic zone of India as an area beyond and adjacent to territorial waters up to a limit of 200 nautical miles.32."

            "sub_section_description": "In the case of British India Steam Navigation Co Ltd v Shanmughavilas Cashew Industries,33. the Supreme Court examined the effective operation of the statutes of a country in relation to foreigners and foreign ships. In general, a statute extends territorially, unless the contrary is stated, throughout the country and will extend to the territorial waters, and such places as intention to that effect is shown. A statute extends to all persons within the country if that intention is shown. The Indian Parliament, therefore, has no authority to legislate for foreign vessels or foreigners in them on the high seas. Thus a foreign ship on the high seas, or her foreign owners or their agents in a foreign country, are not deprived of rights by our statutory enactment expressed in general terms unless it provides that a foreign ship entering an Indian port or territorial waters and thus coming within the territorial jurisdiction is to be covered. Without anything more Indian statutes are ineffective against foreign property and foreigners outside the jurisdiction.  It is this principle which is reﬂected in section 2(2) of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958.34. Earlier in Aban Loyd Chiles Offshore Ltd v UOI,35. it was held that India has been given only certain limited sovereign rights and such limited sovereign rights conferred on India in respect of continental shelf and exclusive economic zone cannot be equated to extending the sovereignty of India over the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone as in the case of territorial waters."

(B) Admiralty jurisdiction.—The jurisdiction to try offences committed on the high seas is known as the admiralty jurisdiction. It is founded on the principle that a ship on the high seas is a ﬂoating island belonging to the nation whose ﬂag she is ﬂying. Admiralty jurisdiction extends over— (1) Offences committed on Indian ships on the high seas. (2) Offences committed on foreign ships in Indian territorial waters. (3) Piracy.  Power to enforce claims against foreign ships is an essential attribute of admiralty jurisdiction and it is assumed over such ships while they are within the jurisdiction of the High Court by arresting and detaining them. Admiralty jurisdiction of the High Courts in India has been historically traced to the Charters of 1774 and 1728, as subsequently expanded and clariﬁed by the Letters Patent of 1823, 1862 and 1865 read with the Admiralty Court Act, 1861, the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890, and the Colonial Court of Admiralty (India) Act, 1891 and preserved by section 106 of the Government of India Act, 1915, section 223 of the Government of India Act, 1935 and   Article 225 of the Constitution of India. The pre-Constitution enactments have continued to remain in force in India as existing laws.67. The High Court as a Court of Admiralty is treated as a separate entity exercising a distinct and speciﬁc or prescribed or limited jurisdiction. This reasoning is based on the assumption that the continuance in force of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890 as an existing law carves out a distinct jurisdiction of the High Court limited in ambit and eﬃcacy to what has been granted by the Admiralty Court Act 1861, and that jurisdiction has remained stultiﬁed ever since. This restrictive construction is not warranted by the provisions of the Constitution. Accordingly, a foreign ship falls within the jurisdiction of the High Court where the vessel happens to be at the relevant time, i.e., at the time when the jurisdiction of the High Court is invoked, or, where the cause of action wholly or in part arises. The Merchant Shipping Act empowers the concerned High Court to arrest a ship in respect of a substantive right. This jurisdiction can be assumed by the concerned High Court, whether or not the defendant resides or carries on business, or the cause of action arose wholly or in part, within the local limits of its jurisdiction. Once a foreign ship is arrested within the local limits of the jurisdiction of the High Court, and the owner of the ship has entered appearance and furnished security to the satisfaction of the High Court for the release of the ship, the proceedings continue as a personal action. The conclusion is that all the High Courts in India have inherent admiralty jurisdiction and can invoke the same for the enforcement of a maritime claim.68. Even while exercising extraordinary powers available under the Constitution the jurisdiction of the High Court is primarily circumscribed by its territorial limits, viz., the jurisdiction has to be in context of the territorial jurisdiction available to the High Court. If the overall scheme of IPC, 1860 (section 4), Cr PC, 1973 (section 188), The Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 (section 437) and the Territorial Waters Act, 1976 (section 13) are taken into consideration read with sections 2(2) and 3(15) of the Merchant Shipping Act, it is apparent that for a Court, including High Court, to be vested with jurisdiction, an offender or offending vessel have to be found within local territorial limits of such Court.69."

The Convention on the Law of Sea known as United National Convention on the Law of Sea, 1982 (UNCLOS) sets out the legal framework applicable to combating piracy and armed robbery at sea, as well as other ocean activities. UNCLOS, 1982 is a   comprehensive code on the international law of sea. It codiﬁes and consolidates the traditional law within a single, uniﬁcatory legal framework. It has changed the legal concept of continental shelf and also introduced a new maritime zone known as exclusive economic zone. Exclusive economic zone is a new concept having several new features.71. The UNCLOS signed by India in 1982 and ratiﬁed on 29 June 1995, encapsulates the law of the sea and is supplemented by several subsequent resolutions adopted by the Security Council of the United Nations. Before UNCLOS came into existence, the law relating to the seas which was in operation in India, was the Territorial Waters, Continental Shelf, Exclusive Economic Zone and Other Maritime Zones Act, 1976, which spelt out the jurisdiction of the Central Government over the Territorial Waters, the Contiguous Zones and the Exclusive Economic Zone. The provisions of the UNCLOS are in harmony with and not in conﬂict with the provisions of the Maritime Zones Act, 1976, in this regard. Article 33 of the Convention recognises and describes the Contiguous Zone of a nation to extend to 24 nautical miles from the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured. Similarly, Articles 56 and 57 describe the rights, jurisdiction and duties of the coastal State in the Exclusive Economic Zone and the breadth thereof extending to 20 nautical miles from the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured. This provision is also in consonance with the provisions of the 1976 Act. The area of difference between the provisions of the Maritime Zones Act, 1976, and the Convention occurs in Article 97 of the Convention which relates to the penal jurisdiction in matters of collision or any other incident of navigation.72."

Thus, the personnel of the Army, Navy and Airforce are governed by the provisions of the Army Act, 1950, The Navy Act, 1957, and The Indian Air Force Act, 1950 in regard to offences of mutiny and desertion committed by them.79. 1. 'Special or local law'.—A special law is a law relating to a particular subject;80. whereas a local law is a law which applies only to a particular part of the country.81. The distinction between a statute creating a new offence with a particular penalty and a statute enlarging the ambit of an existing offence by including new acts within it with a particular penalty is well settled. In the former case the new offence is punishable by the new penalty only; in the latter it is punishable also by all such penalties as were applicable before the Act to the offence in which it is included. The Principle is that where a new offence is created and the particular manner in which proceedings should be taken is laid down, then proceedings cannot be taken in any other way.82. However, a person cannot be punished under both the Penal Code and a special law for the same   offence,83. and ordinarily the sentence should be under the special Act.84. This is, however, conﬁned to cases where the offences are coincident or practically so.85. The Supreme Court issued speciﬁc guidelines regarding the interpretation of general law and special law. See the Box below for these Guidelines. Supreme Court Guidelines on Interpretation of General law and Special law (i) When a provision of law regulates a particular subject and a subsequent law  contains a provision regulating the same subject, there is no presumption that the later law repeals the earlier law. The rule-making authority while making the later rule is deemed to know the existing law on the subject. If the subsequent law does not repeal the earlier rule, there can be no presumption of an intention to repeal the earlier rule; (ii) When two provisions of law — one being a general law and the other being  special law govern a matter, the court should endeavour to apply a harmonious construction to the said provisions. But where the intention of the rule-making authority is made clear either expressly or impliedly, as to which law should prevail, the same shall be given effect. (iii) If the repugnancy or inconsistency subsists in spite of an effort to read them  harmoniously, the prior special law is not presumed to be repealed by the later general law. The prior special law will continue to apply and prevail in spite of the subsequent general law. But where a clear intention to make a rule of universal application by superseding the earlier special law is evident from the later general law, then the later general law, will prevail over the prior special law. (iv) Where a later special law is repugnant to or inconsistent with an earlier general  law, the later special law will prevail over the earlier general law.

The provisions of this Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of, the provisions of any other law relating to contempt of Courts.91. Contempt proceeding is sui generis (of its own kind or class or unique). It has peculiar features which are not found in criminal proceedings. The respondent does not stand in the position of a person accused of an offence. Initiation of contempt proceedings against the respondent who is already accused in a criminal proceedings, does not amount to double jeopardy.92. Mens rea is not necessary for committing contempt of Court. The main ingredient of the offence of contempt of Court is the result of one's contumacious act of offending the prestige and dignity of the judiciary so as to lower it in the estimation of the general public.

ILLUSTRATION (a) The sections, in this Code, which contain deﬁnitions of offences, do not express  that a child under seven years of age cannot commit such offences, but the deﬁnitions are to be understood subject to the general exception which provides that nothing shall be an offence which is done by a child under seven years of age. (b) A, a police-oﬃcer, without warrant, apprehends Z, who has committed murder.  Here A is not guilty of the offence of wrongful conﬁnement; for he was bound by law to apprehend Z and therefore the case falls within the general exception which provides that \"nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is bound by law to do it\".  COMMENT— The \"general exceptions\" enacted by Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860) are of universal application and for the sake of brevity of expression, instead of repeating in every section that the deﬁnition is to be taken subject to the exceptions, the legislature by section 6 IPC, 1860 enacted that all the deﬁnitions must be regarded as subject to the general exceptions. Therefore, general exceptions are part of the deﬁnition of every offence contained in IPC, 1860, but the burden to prove their existence lies on the accused.1. Section 6 is a convenient formula to avoid reproduction of lengthy exceptions in the description of offences. In other words, all the offences must be read subject to Chapter IV relating to General Exceptions (sections. 76–106 IPC, 1860). So when an act falls within any one of these exceptions by virtue of section 6 of the Code, the accused has to be given beneﬁt of the appropriate General Exception even though it is not speciﬁcally stated over again in the description of the offence committed.2. Section 6 of the Indian Penal Code imposes an obligation on the court to consider the case of exceptions on its own so far as it relates to the burden of proving legal insanity under section 106 of the Act. If the case of the accused comes within the purview of section 84 IPC, 1860, which is one of the provisions in Chapter IV of the General Exceptions of   the Indian Penal Code, the court is to give due consideration and ﬁnd out as to whether at the time of the occurrence the accused had any mental disability so as not to know what he was doing.3. The provisions of section 6 should be read as a proviso to section 105 of the Evidence Act 1872.4. When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the General Exceptions in the Indian Penal Code (XLV of 1860), or within any special exception or proviso contained in any other part of the same Code, or in any law deﬁning the offence, is upon him, and the Court shall presume the absence of such circumstances.5.",

'Corporeal property' is property which may be perceived by the senses, in contradistinction to incorporeal rights, which are not so perceivable, as obligations of all kinds. Thus, salt produced on a swamp,101. and papers forming part of the record of a case,102. are movable property within the meaning of this section.

'Land and things attached to the earth'.—This section does not exempt \"earth and things attached to the earth\", but \"land and things attached to the earth\"; \"land\" and \"earth\" are not synonymous terms, and there is a great distinction between \"the earth\", and \"earth\". By severance, things that are immovable become movable; and it is perfectly correct to call those things attached which can be severed; and undoubtedly it is possible to sever earth from the earth and attach it again thereto. Earth, that is soil, and all the component parts of the soil, inclusive of stones and minerals, when severed from the earth or land to which it was attached, are movable property capable of being the subject of theft.104. Any part of \"the earth\", whether it is stones or sand or clay or any other component, when severed from \"the earth\", is movable property.105. Standing crop, so long as it is attached to the earth is not movable property as deﬁned in the Code, but the moment it is severed from the earth its character is changed and it can become the subject of theft.106.

Where the accused removed jute kept in a pond of the complainant for wetting and requested the complainant to take it away as the accused bona ﬁde claimed the ownership of the pond, it was held that no wrongful loss was caused to the complainant.112. The words \"gaining wrongfully,\" or \"losing wrongfully\" would cover cases of wrongful detention of property in the one case and wrongfully being kept out of property in the   other.113. 1. 'Wrongfully kept out of any property'.—When the owner is kept out of possession of his property with the object of depriving him of the beneﬁt arising from the possession even temporarily, the case will come within the deﬁnition. If a creditor by force or otherwise takes the goods of his debtor out of his possession against his will in order to put pressure on him to compel him to discharge his debt he will be guilty of theft by causing wrongful loss to the debtor.114. The loss must be caused wrongfully. Thus, whose municipal oﬃcers demolished an unauthorised construction as the complainant refused to remove the structure in spite of notice, they could not be held guilty of committing an offence of mischief within the meaning of section 425, IPC, 1860, for there was no intention to cause wrongful loss to the complainant as the demolition was done lawfully in exercise of powers under sections 179 and 189 of the Maharashtra Municipalities Act.115. Fees payable to a college for attending lectures are \"property\" within the meaning of this section.116.  108. (1866) 3 MHC (Appx.) 6. 109.

        "section_comments": "The intention with which an act is done is very important in determining whether the act is done 'dishonestly' or 'fraudulently'. 1. 'Intent to defraud'.—The terms 'fraud' and 'defraud' are not deﬁned in the Penal Code. The word 'defraud' is of double meaning in the sense that it either may or may not imply deprivation, and, as it is not deﬁned, its meaning must be sought by a consideration of the context in which the word 'fraudulently' is found.126. Fraud is an act of deliberate deception with a design to secure something, which is otherwise not due. Fraud and deception are synonymous.127. To 'defraud' or do something fraudulently is not by itself made an offence under the Penal Code, but various acts when done fraudulently (or fraudulently and dishonestly) are made offences. These include: (i) Fraudulent removal or concealment of property (sections 206, 421, 424) (ii) Fraudulent claim to property to prevent seizure (section 207). (iii) Fraudulent suffering or obtaining a decree (sections 208 and 210) (iv) Fraudulent possession/delivery of counterfeit coin (sections 239, 240, 242 and  243). (v) Fraudulent alteration/diminishing weight of coin (sections 246–253) (vi) Fraudulent acts relating to stamps (sections 261–261) (vii) Fraudulent use of false instruments/weight/measure (sections 264–266) (viii) Cheating (sections 415–420) (ix) Fraudulent prevention of debt being available to creditors (section 422). (x) Fraudulent execution of deed of transfer containing false statement of  consideration (section 423). (xi) Forgery making or executing a false document (sections 463–471 and 474)   (xii) Fraudulent cancellation/destruction of valuable security, etc. (section 477) (xiii) Fraudulently going through marriage ceremony (section 496).  It follows therefore, that by merely alleging or showing that a person acted fraudulently, it cannot be assumed that he committed an offence punishable under the Code or any other law, unless that fraudulent act is speciﬁed to be an offence under the Code or other law.128. The expression 'defraud' involves two elements, namely, deceit and injury to the person deceived. The injury may even comprise a non-economic or non-pecuniary loss. Even in those rare cases where the beneﬁt to the deceiver does not cause corresponding loss to the deceived, the second condition is satisﬁed.129. The expression \"intent to deceive\" is different from the expression \"intent to defraud\".130. \"Intent to defraud\" is established only when the deception has as its aim some advantage or the likelihood of advantage to the person who causes the deceit or some kind of injury or the possibility of injury to another.131. Thus, where an expert deposing before a court as a defence witness was asked to produce his credentials before the court and it appeared from the documents produced that they were not genuine, it was held that as he acted under the orders of the court and not voluntarily, it could not be said that his intention was to cause any one to act to his disadvantage. In the circumstances, he did not act with \"intent to defraud\". He was, therefore, held liable under sections 193 and 196 but not under sections 465 and 471, IPC, 1860.132.",

            "sub_section_description": "According to the Supreme Court \"the word \"defraud\" includes an element of deceit. Deceit is not an ingredient of the deﬁnition of the word \"dishonestly\" while it is an important ingredient of the deﬁnition of the word \"fraudulently\". The former involves a pecuniary or economic gain or loss while the latter by construction excludes that element. Further, the juxtaposition of the two expressions \"dishonestly\" and \"fraudulently\" used in the various sections of the Code indicate their close aﬃnity and therefore, the deﬁnition of one may give colour to the other. To illustrate, in the deﬁnition of \"dishonestly\", wrongful gain or wrongful loss is the necessary ingredient. Both need not exist, one would be enough. So too, if the expression \"fraudulently\" were to be held to involve the element of injury to the person or persons deceived, it would be reasonable to assume that the injury should be something other than pecuniary or economic loss. Though almost always an advantage to one causes loss to another and vice versa, it need not necessarily be so.\"133. Where the accused, after the execution and registration of a document, which was not required by law to be attested, added his name to the document as an attesting witness, it was held that his act was neither fraudulent nor dishonest and the accused was, therefore, not guilty of forgery.134. A person who is not a member of Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribes obtains a false certiﬁcate with a view to gain undue advantage to which he or she was not otherwise entitled to would amount to commission of fraud135. Suppression of a material document would also amount to a fraud on the court.136."

COMMENT— Under this section property in the possession of a person's wife, clerk, or servant, is deemed to be in that person's possession.

'Wife'.—A permanent mistress may be regarded as a 'wife'. When a man furnishes a house for his mistress' occupation, he may reasonably be presumed to be in possession of all articles therein which can reasonably be inferred to belong to him or to be in possession of his mistress on his behalf. But the inference must be inapplicable to articles of which the mistress is in possession illegally or contrary to the provisions of law, especially when the article in question is such that he might well remain in ignorance that it was in his mistress' possession.142. Under this section the possession of the wife or servant must be shown to be on account of the accused otherwise he cannot be held liable for possession by his wife or servant of any incriminatory thing even in his own house. In other words, it must be shown that the accused was in conscious possession of the thing in question through his wife or servant. Moreover, it must also be shown that the possession of the incriminatory thing amounted to an offence under the Indian Penal Code. Thus, possession of illicit liquor or an unlicenced pistol by the wife of the accused in his house would not make him liable for an offence under the Prohibition Act or the Arms Act. The mere fact that the accused was the head of the family would not go to show   that the accused must have been in conscious possession of the incriminatory thing.143.  141.

It also says that it is not necessary that counterfeit note should be made with primary intention of its being looked as genuine. It is suﬃcient if resemblance to genuine currency note is so caused that it is capable to being passed as such.145. In order to apply section 28, what the Court has to see is whether one thing is made to resemble another thing and if that is so and if the resemblance is such that a person might be deceived by it, there will be a presumption of the necessary intention or knowledge to make the thing counterfeit, unless the contrary is proved. The difference between the counterfeit and the original is not therefore, limited to a difference existing only by reason of faulty reproduction.146. The main ingredients of counterfeiting as laid down in section 28, IPC, 1860, are: (i) causing one thing to resemble another thing, (ii) intending by means of such resemblance to practice deception, or (iii) knowing it to be likely that deception will thereby be practised.  There can be counterfeiting even though the imitation is not exact and there are differences in detail between the original and the imitation so long as the resemblance is so close that deception may thereby be practised. And if the resemblance is such that a person might be deceived thereby, it shall be presumed until the contrary is proved that the person causing one thing to resemble another thing was intending by means of that resemblance to practise deception or knew it to be likely that deception would thereby be practised.147.   The word 'counterfeit' occurs in offences relating to coin provided in Chapter XII and offences relating to property marks and currency notes in Chapter XVIII. If coins are made to resemble genuine coins and the intention of the makers is merely to use them in order to foist a false case upon their enemies, those coins do not come within the deﬁnition of counterfeit coins.148.

'Act' is a determination of the will, producing an effect in the sensible world. This word includes writing and speaking, or, in short, any external manifestation. In the Code it is not conﬁned to its ordinary meaning of positive conduct of doing something, but includes also illegal omissions. 2. 'Omissions'.—Liability for an omission requires a legal duty to act; a moral duty to act is not suﬃcient. A duty arises from the former when an offence is deﬁned in terms of omission. This is the situation where the legislature has made it an offence. A legal duty to act may also be created by a provision of either criminal or civil separate from the offence charged. Since there is no moral difference between (i) a positive act and (ii) an omission when a duty is established, it is to be borne in mind that cases of omissions, the liability should be exceptional and needs to be adequately justiﬁed in each instance. Secondly, when it is imposed this should be done by clear statutory language. Verbs primarily denoting (and forbidding) active conduct should not be construed to include omissions except when the statute contains a genuine implication to this effect.165. An 'act' generally means something voluntarily done by a person, but in IPC, 1860 the term 'act' is not conﬁned to its ordinary meaning of positive conduct of doing something but includes also illegal omission. The effect of sections 32 and 33, IPC, 1860 taken together is that the term 'act' comprises one or more 'acts' or one or more illegal omissions. The Code (IPC, 1860) makes punishable omissions which have caused, which have been intended to cause or which have been known to be likely to cause certain evil effect in the same manner as it punishes acts provided they were illegal and when the law imposes on a person a duty to act, his illegal omission to act renders (him) in liable to punishment.166.",

The true contents of the section are that if two or more persons intentionally do an act jointly, the position in law is just the same as if each of them has done it individually by himself. As observed in Ashok Kumar v State of Punjab,174. the existence of a common intention amongst the participants in a crime is the essential element for application of this section. It is not necessary that the acts of the several persons charged with   commission of an offence jointly must be the same or identically similar. The acts may be different in character, but must have been actuated by one and the same common intention in order to attract the provision.175. Barendra Kumar Ghosh v King Emperor,176. stated the true purport of section 34 as: The words of s.34 are not to be eviscerated by reading them in this exceedingly limited sense. By s.33 a criminal act in s.34 includes a series of acts and, further, 'act' includes omission to act, for example, an omission to interfere in order to prevent a murder being done before one's very eyes. By s.37, when any offence is committed by means of several acts whoever intentionally cooperates in the commission of that offence by doing any one of those acts, either singly or jointly with any other person, commits that offence. Even if the appellant did nothing as he stood outside the door, it is to be remembered that in crimes as in other things 'they also serve who only stand and wait'.177."

The essence of section 34 IPC, 1860 is a simultaneous consensus of the minds of the persons participating in criminal action to bring about a particular result. Section 34 IPC, 1860 stipulates that the act must have been done in furtherance of the common intention. In fact, the section is intended to cover a case where a number of persons act together and on the facts of the case it is not possible for the prosecution to prove as to which of the persons who acted together actually committed the crime. Little or no distinction exists between a charge for an offence under a particular section and a charge under that section read with section 34.178. Therefore, section 34, IPC, 1860, would apply even if no charge is framed under that section provided of course from the evidence it becomes clear that there was pre-arranged plan to achieve the commonly intended object.179. Thus, where six persons were charged under sections 148, 302/149 and 307/149, IPC, 1860, but two were acquitted, the remaining four accused could be convicted on the charges of murder and attempt to murder with the aid of section 34 of the Penal Code.180. This section really means that if two or more persons intentionally do a thing jointly, it is just the same as if each of them had done it individually.181. If the criminal act was a fresh and independent act springing wholly from the mind of the doer, the others are not liable merely because when it was done they were intending to be partakers with the doer in a different criminal act."

            "sub_section_description": "Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code recognises the principle of vicarious liability in criminal jurisprudence. The said principle enshrined under Section 34 of the Code would be attracted only if one or more than one accused person act conjointly in the commission of offence with others. It is not necessary that all such persons should be named and identiﬁed before the liability under Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code can be invoked. So long as the evidence brought by the prosecution would disclose that one or more accused persons had acted in concert with other persons not named or identiﬁed, the liability under Section 34 of the Code would still be attracted. Once the other accused stands acquitted in absence of said evidence, the vicarious liability under section 34 of the Code would not be attracted so as to hold the accused liable for the offence with the aid of Section 34 of the Code. However, the accused would still be liable for the offence if the injury or injuries leading to offence can be attributed to him.182. A bare reading of this section shows that the section could be dissected as follows:   (a) Criminal act is done by several persons; (b) Such act is done in furtherance of the common intention of all; and (c) Each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done  by him alone. (d) But, it is not necessary that all such persons should be named and identiﬁed  before the liability under Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code can be invoked.183. In other words, these three ingredients would guide the court in determining whether an accused is liable to be convicted with the aid of section 34. While ﬁrst two are the acts which are attributable and have to be proved as actions of the accused, the third is the consequence. Once the criminal act and common intention are proved, then by ﬁction of law, criminal liability of having done that act by each person individually would arise. The criminal act, according to section 34 IPC, 1860 must be done by several persons. The emphasis in this part of the section is on the word \"done\".184. The section does not envisage the separate act by all the accused persons for becoming responsible for the ultimate criminal act. If such an interpretation is accepted, the purpose of section 34 shall be rendered infructuous.185. Under section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, a preconcert in the sense of a distinct previous plan is not necessary to be proved.186. It is a well settled law that mere presence or association with other members is not per se suﬃcient to hold each of them criminally liable for the offences committed by the other members, unless there is suﬃcient evidence on record to show that one such member also intends to or knows the likelihood of commission of such an offending act.187."

            "sub_section_description": "The case of Barendra Kumar Ghosh v King Emperor,188. is a locus classicus and has been followed by number of High Courts and the Supreme Court in a large number of cases. In this case, the Judicial Committee dealt with the scope of section 34 dealing with the acts done in furtherance of the common intention, making all equally liable for the results of all the acts of others. It was observed that section 34 when it speaks of a criminal act done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, has regard not to the offence as a whole, but to the criminal act, that is to say, the totality of the series of acts which result in the offence. In the case of a person assaulted by many accused, the criminal act is the offence which ﬁnally results, though the achievement of that criminal act may be the result of the action of several persons. In another celebrated case Mehbub Shah v King-Emperor,189. the court held that: Section 34 lays down a principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act. The section does not say \"the common intentions of all,\" nor does it say \"an intention common to all.\" Under the section, the essence of that liability is to be found in the existence of a common intention animating the accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such intention. To invoke the aid of s.34 successfully, it must be shown that the criminal act complained against was done by one of the accused persons in the furtherance of the common intention of all; if this is shown, then liability for the crime may be imposed on any one of the persons in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone. This being the principle, it is clear to their Lordships that common intention within the meaning of the section implies a pre-arranged plan, and to convict the accused of an offence applying the section it should be proved that the criminal act was done in concert pursuant to the prearranged plan.  Approving the judgments of the Privy Council in Barendra Kumar Ghosh (Barendra Kumar Ghosh v King Emperor,190. and Mahbub Shah cases191 a three-Judge Bench of Supreme Court in Pandurang v State of Hyderabad,192. held that to attract the applicability of section 34 of the Code the prosecution is under an obligation to   establish that there existed a common intention which requires a pre-arranged plan because before a man can be vicariously convicted for the criminal act of another, the act must have been done in furtherance of the common intention of all.

But referring to the common intention, it needs to be clariﬁed that the courts must keep in mind the ﬁne distinction between \"common intention\" on the one hand and mens rea as understood in criminal jurisprudence on the other. Common intention is not alike or identical to mens rea. The latter may be coincidental with or collateral to the former but they are distinct and different.193."

Thus, the dominant feature of section 34 is the element of intention and participation in action. This participation need not in all cases be by physical presence.195. The Supreme Court has held that it is the essence of the section that the person must be physically present at the actual commission of the crime. He need not be present in the actual room; he can, for instance, stand guard by a gate outside ready to warn his companions about any approach of danger or wait in a car on a nearby road ready to facilitate their escape, but he must be physically present at the scene of the occurrence and must actually participate in the commission of the offence in some way or other at the time crime is actually being committed.196. The Supreme Court has emphasised that proof of participation by acceptable evidence may in circumstances be a clue to the common intention and that it would not be fatal to the prosecution case that the culprits had no community of interests.197. Sometimes, however, absence of actual participation may serve an important purpose as it happened, for example, where in a love triangle the paramour killed the woman's husband and she remained sitting with the dead body inside the house without opening the door. The main accused having been acquitted, the Supreme Court held that the woman alone could not be convicted under section 302 read with section 34 particularly in view of the fact that the nature of the injuries (gandasa blows with a heavy hand) made it explicit that they were the handiwork of masculine power and not that of feminine hands.198. It is also necessary to remember that mere presence of the offender at the scene of murder without any participation to facilitate the offence is not enough.199. By merely accompanying the accused one does not become liable for the crime committed by the accused within the meaning of section 34, IPC, 1860.200. The degree of participation is also an important factor.201. The court restated the two ingredients for application of the section which are: (i)   common intention to commit a crime, and (ii) participation by all the accused in the act or acts in furtherance of the common  intention. These two things establish their joint liability.202. Where one of the accused persons focussed light on the victim with a torch so as to enable others to assault him, otherwise it is a dark night. The court said that his conduct prior and subsequent to the occurrence clearly showed that he shared the common intention so far as the assault on the deceased was concerned. Hence, he was rightly roped in under section 34.203. If participation is proved and common intention is absent, section 34 cannot be invoked.204. The co-accused was standing outside the house, where the incident took place, while the others committed the murder. There is no evidence of his having played any part in the crime. He did not even act as a guard; he did not prevent the witness from entering the house. There is no evidence of the formation or sharing of any common intention with the other accused. No weapon was seized from him, nor was any property connected with the crime, conﬁscated from him. It was therefore, held that, it was not safe to convict the coaccused of the offence of murder with the aid of sub-sections 34 and 120(B).205."

            "sub_section_description": "Physical presence at the very spot is not always a necessary ingredient to attract the action. The Supreme Court decision in Shreekantiah Ramayya v State of Bombay,206. is the authority for the aforesaid proposition. Vivian Bose, J, speaking for the Bench of three Judges stated thus: He need not be present in the actual room; he can, for instance, stand guard by a gate outside ready to warn his companions about any approach of danger or wait in a car on a nearby road ready to facilitate their escape.  What is required is his actual participation in the commission of the offence in some way or other at the time when the crime is actually being committed. The participation need not in all cases be by physical presence. In offence involving physical violence, normally presence at the scene of offence may be necessary, but such is not the case in respect of other offences when the offence consists of diverse acts which may be done at different times and places. The physical presence at the scene of offence of the offender sough to be rendered liable under this section is not one of the conditions of its applicability in every case.207. Even the concept of presence of the co-accused at the scene is not a necessary requirement to attract section 34 of the IPC, 1860, e.g., the co-accused can remain a little away and supply weapons to the participating accused either by throwing or by catapulting them so that the participating accused can inﬂict injuries on the targeted person. There may be other provisions in the IPC, 1860 like subsections 120B or 109 which could be invoked then to catch such non-participating accused. Thus, participation in the crime in furtherance of the common intention is sine qua non for section 34 IPC, 1860. Exhortation to other accused, even guarding the scene etc. would amount to participation. Of course, when the allegation against an accused is that he participated in the crime by oral exhortation or by guarding the scene the court has to evaluate the evidence very carefully for deciding whether that person had really done any such act.208. The absence of any overt act of assault, exhortation or possession of weapon cannot be singularly determinative of absence of common intention.209."

Common intention is a state of mind. It is not possible to read a person's mind. There can hardly be direct evidence of common intention. The existence or nonexistence of a common intention amongst the accused has to be deciphered cumulatively from their conduct and behaviour in the facts and circumstances of each case. Events prior to the occurrence as also after, and during the occurrence, are all relevant to deduce if there existed any common intention. There can be no straight jacket formula.231. The Court has to examine the prosecution evidence in regard to application of section 34 cumulatively and if the ingredients are satisﬁed, the consequences must follow. It is diﬃcult to state any hard and fast rule which can be applied universally to all cases. It will always depend on the facts and circumstances of the given case whether the person involved in the commission of the crime with a common intention can be held guilty of the main offence committed by them together.232. Courts, in most cases, have to infer the intention from the act(s) or conduct of the accused or other relevant circumstances of the case. However, an inference as to the common intention shall not be readily drawn; the criminal liability   can arise only when such inference can be drawn with a certain degree of assurance.233. In most cases it has to be inferred from the act or conduct or other relevant circumstances of the case in hand.234. This inference can be gathered by the manner in which the accused arrived on the scene and mounted the attack, the determination and concert with which the beating was given or the injuries caused by one or some of them, the acts done by others to assist those causing the injuries, the concerted conduct subsequent to the commission of the offence, for instance all of them left the scene of the incident together and other acts which all or some may have done as would help in determining the common intention. In other words, the totality of the circumstances must be taken into consideration in arriving at the conclusion whether the accused had a common intention to commit an offence of which they could be convicted.235. Manner of attack shows the common intention of accused.236. The Supreme Court has reiterated: We reiterate that for common intention, there could rarely be direct evidence. The ultimate decision, at any rate would invariably depend upon the inference deducible from the circumstances of each case. It is settled law that the common intention or the intention of the individuals concerned in furtherance of the common intention could be proved either from direct evidence or by inference from the acts or attending circumstances of the case and conduct of the parties.237."

Where the appellants caused injuries not enough to cause the death but the same were caused by another, in the absence of a charge under section 34, they were found to be guilty under section 326 of IPC, 1860.240. Sections 34, 114 and 149 of the IPC, 1860 provide for criminal liability viewed from different angles as regards actual participants, accessories and men actuated by a common object or a common intention; and as explained by ﬁve Judge Constitution Bench of in Willie Slavey v The State of MP,241. the charge is a rolled-up one involving the direct liability and the constructive liability without specifying who are directly liable and who are sought to be made constructively liable.242. But before a court can convict a person under section 302, read with section 34, of the Indian Penal Code, it should come to a deﬁnite conclusion that the said person had a prior concert with one or more other persons, named or unnamed, for committing the said offence. A few illustrations will bring out the impact of section 34 on different situations. (1) A, B, C and D are charged under section 302, read with section 34, of the Indian Penal Code, for committing the murder of E. The evidence is directed to establish that the said four persons have taken part in the murder. (2) A, B, C and D and unnamed others are charged under the said sections. But evidence is adduced to prove that the said persons, along with others, named or unnamed, participated jointly in the commission of that offence.   (3) A, B, C and D are charged under the said sections. But the evidence is directed to prove that A, B, C and D, along with 3 others, have jointly committed the offence. As regards the third illustration, a Court is certainly entitled to come to the conclusion that one of the named accused is guilty of murder under section 302, read with section 34, of the Indian Penal Code, though the other three named accused are acquitted, if it accepts the evidence that the said accused acted in concert along with persons, named or unnamed, other than those acquitted, in the commission of the offence. In the second illustration the Court can come to the same conclusion and convict one of the named accused if it is satisﬁed that no prejudice has been caused to the accused by the defect in the charge. But in the ﬁrst illustration the Court certainly can convict two or more of the named accused if it accepts the evidence that they acted conjointly in committing the offence. But what is the position if the Court acquits 3 of the 4 accused either because it rejects the prosecution evidence or because it gives the beneﬁt of doubt to the said accused? Can it hold, in the absence of a charge as well as evidence, that though the three accused are acquitted, some other unidentiﬁed persons acted conjointly along with one of the named persons? If the Court could do so, it would be making out a new case for the prosecution: it would be deciding contrary to the evidence adduced in the case. A Court cannot obviously make out a case for the prosecution which is not disclosed either in the charge or in regard to which there is no basis in the evidence. There must be some foundation in the evidence that persons other than those named have taken part in the commission of the offence and if there is such a basis the case will be covered by the third illustration.243. Absence of charge under section 34 is not fatal by itself unless prejudice to the accused is shown.244."

(ii) Some active participation, especially in a crime involving physical violence is  necessary under section 34 but section 149, IPC, 1860, does not require it and the liability arises by reason of mere membership of the unlawful assembly with a common object and there may be no active participation at all in the preparation and commission of the crime. (iii) Section 34 speaks of common intention but section 149, IPC, 1860,   contemplates common object which is undoubtedly wider in its scope and amplitude than intention. If the offence committed by a member of an unlawful assembly is in prosecution of the common object of the unlawful assembly or such as the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of the common object, all other members of the unlawful assembly would be guilty of that offence under section 149, IPC, 1860, although they may not have intended to do it or participated in the actual commission of that offence.246. (iv) Section 34 does not ﬁx a minimum number of persons who must share the  common intention, whereas section 149, IPC, 1860, requires that there must be at least ﬁve persons who must have the same common object (see also discussion under sub-head \"Sections 34 and 149\" under section 149, IPC, 1860, infra).247."

Section 96 IPC, 1860 says that nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right of private defence. Though all the accused would be liable for committing the murder of a person by doing an act or acts in furtherance of the common intention, they would not be liable for the act or acts if they had the right of private defence to voluntarily cause death of that person. Common intention, therefore, has relevance only to the offence and not to the right of private defence. What would be an offence by reason of constructive liability would cease to be one if the act constituting the offence was done in exercise of the right of private defence. If the voluntary causing of death is not permissible under the right of private defence under section 96, then the common intention in regard thereto will lead to the result that the accused persons must be held guilty by reason of constructive liability under the relevant section (in this case section 304 Part I IPC, 1860). If, however, the common intention was only to commit an act which was permissible within the conﬁnes of s. 96 read with s. 98, then constructive liability under section 34 cannot be said to have been accrued to the accused. If the right of private defence was exceeded by some persons, the guilt of each of the accused proved to have exceeded the right of private defence would have to be dealt with separately. The instant case came under the former situation, and hence, such persons were guilty under section 304, Part I IPC, 1860.

The true contents of the section are that if two or more persons intentionally do an act jointly, the position in law is just the same as if each of them has done it individually by himself. As observed in Ashok Kumar v State of Punjab,174. the existence of a common intention amongst the participants in a crime is the essential element for application of this section. It is not necessary that the acts of the several persons charged with commission of an offence jointly must be the same or identically similar. The acts may be different in character, but must have been actuated by one and the same common   intention in order to attract the provision.175. Barendra Kumar Ghosh v King Emperor,176. stated the true purport of section 34 as: The words of s.34 are not to be eviscerated by reading them in this exceedingly limited sense. By s.33 a criminal act in s.34 includes a series of acts and, further, 'act' includes omission to act, for example, an omission to interfere in order to prevent a murder being done before one's very eyes. By s.37, when any offence is committed by means of several acts whoever intentionally cooperates in the commission of that offence by doing any one of those acts, either singly or jointly with any other person, commits that offence. Even if the appellant did nothing as he stood outside the door, it is to be remembered that in crimes as in other things 'they also serve who only stand and wait'.177."

The essence of section 34 IPC, 1860 is a simultaneous consensus of the minds of the persons participating in criminal action to bring about a particular result. Section 34 IPC, 1860 stipulates that the act must have been done in furtherance of the common intention. In fact, the section is intended to cover a case where a number of persons act together and on the facts of the case it is not possible for the prosecution to prove as to which of the persons who acted together actually committed the crime. Little or no distinction exists between a charge for an offence under a particular section and a charge under that section read with section 34.178. Therefore, section 34, IPC, 1860, would apply even if no charge is framed under that section provided of course from the evidence it becomes clear that there was pre-arranged plan to achieve the commonly intended object.179. Thus, where six persons were charged under sections 148, 302/149 and 307/149, IPC, 1860, but two were acquitted, the remaining four accused could be convicted on the charges of murder and attempt to murder with the aid of section 34 of the Penal Code.180. This section really means that if two or more persons intentionally do a thing jointly, it is just the same as if each of them had done it individually.181. If the criminal act was a fresh and independent act springing wholly from the mind of the doer, the others are not liable merely because when it was done they were intending to be partakers with the doer in a different criminal act."

            "sub_section_description": "Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code recognises the principle of vicarious liability in criminal jurisprudence. The said principle enshrined under Section 34 of the Code would be attracted only if one or more than one accused person act conjointly in the commission of offence with others. It is not necessary that all such persons should be named and identiﬁed before the liability under Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code can be invoked. So long as the evidence brought by the prosecution would disclose that one or more accused persons had acted in concert with other persons not named or identiﬁed, the liability under Section 34 of the Code would still be attracted. Once the other accused stands acquitted in absence of said evidence, the vicarious liability under section 34 of the Code would not be attracted so as to hold the accused liable for the offence with the aid of Section 34 of the Code. However, the accused would still be liable for the offence if the injury or injuries leading to offence can be attributed to him.182. A bare reading of this section shows that the section could be dissected as follows: (a) Criminal act is done by several persons; (b) Such act is done in furtherance of the common intention of all; and (c) Each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done  by him alone.   (d) But, it is not necessary that all such persons should be named and identiﬁed  before the liability under Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code can be invoked.183. In other words, these three ingredients would guide the court in determining whether an accused is liable to be convicted with the aid of section 34. While ﬁrst two are the acts which are attributable and have to be proved as actions of the accused, the third is the consequence. Once the criminal act and common intention are proved, then by ﬁction of law, criminal liability of having done that act by each person individually would arise. The criminal act, according to section 34 IPC, 1860 must be done by several persons. The emphasis in this part of the section is on the word \"done\".184. The section does not envisage the separate act by all the accused persons for becoming responsible for the ultimate criminal act. If such an interpretation is accepted, the purpose of section 34 shall be rendered infructuous.185. Under section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, a preconcert in the sense of a distinct previous plan is not necessary to be proved.186. It is a well settled law that mere presence or association with other members is not per se suﬃcient to hold each of them criminally liable for the offences committed by the other members, unless there is suﬃcient evidence on record to show that one such member also intends to or knows the likelihood of commission of such an offending act.187."

In this case, the Judicial Committee dealt with the scope of section 34 dealing with the acts done in furtherance of the common intention, making all equally liable for the results of all the acts of others. It was observed that section 34 when it speaks of a criminal act done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, has regard not to the offence as a whole, but to the criminal act, that is to say, the totality of the series of acts which result in the offence. In the case of a person assaulted by many accused, the criminal act is the offence which ﬁnally results, though the achievement of that criminal act may be the result of the action of several persons. In another celebrated case Mehbub Shah v King-Emperor,189. the court held that: Section 34 lays down a principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act. The section does not say \"the common intentions of all,\" nor does it say \"an intention common to all.\" Under the section, the essence of that liability is to be found in the existence of a common intention animating the accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such intention. To invoke the aid of s.34 successfully, it must be shown that the criminal act complained against was done by one of the accused persons in the furtherance of the common intention of all; if this is shown, then liability for the crime may be imposed on any one of the persons in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone. This being the principle, it is clear to their Lordships that common intention within the meaning of the section implies a pre-arranged plan, and to convict the accused of an offence applying the section it should be proved that the criminal act was done in concert pursuant to the prearranged plan.  Approving the judgments of the Privy Council in Barendra Kumar Ghosh (Barendra Kumar Ghosh v King Emperor,190. and Mahbub Shah cases191 a three-Judge Bench of Supreme Court in Pandurang v State of Hyderabad,192. held that to attract the applicability of section 34 of the Code the prosecution is under an obligation to establish that there existed a common intention which requires a pre-arranged plan because before a man can be vicariously convicted for the criminal act of another, the act must have been done in furtherance of the common intention of all.

Thus, the dominant feature of section 34 is the element of intention and participation in action. This participation need not in all cases be by physical presence.195. The Supreme Court has held that it is the essence of the section that the person must be physically present at the actual commission of the crime. He need not be present in the actual room; he can, for instance, stand guard by a gate outside ready to warn his companions about any approach of danger or wait in a car on a nearby road ready to facilitate their escape, but he must be physically present at the scene of the occurrence and must actually participate in the commission of the offence in some way or other at the time crime is actually being committed.196. The Supreme Court has emphasised that proof of participation by acceptable evidence may in circumstances be a clue to the common intention and that it would not be fatal to the prosecution case that the culprits had no community of interests.197. Sometimes, however, absence of actual participation may serve an important purpose as it happened, for example, where in a love triangle the paramour killed the woman's husband and she remained sitting with the dead body inside the house without opening the door. The main accused having been acquitted, the Supreme Court held that the woman alone could not be convicted under section 302 read with section 34 particularly in view of the fact that the nature of the injuries (gandasa blows with a heavy hand) made it explicit that they were the handiwork of masculine power and not that of feminine hands.198. It is also necessary to remember that mere presence of the offender at the scene of murder without any participation to facilitate the offence is not enough.199. By merely accompanying the accused one does not become liable for the crime committed by the accused within the meaning of section 34, IPC, 1860.200. The degree of participation is also an important factor.201. The court restated the two ingredients for application of the section which are: (i) common intention to commit a crime, and (ii) participation by all the accused in the act or acts in furtherance of the common  intention. These two things establish their joint liability.202. Where one of the accused persons focussed light on the victim with a torch so as to enable others to assault him, otherwise it is a dark night. The court said that his conduct prior and subsequent to the occurrence clearly showed that he shared the common intention so far as the assault on the deceased was concerned. Hence, he was rightly roped in under section 34.203. If participation is proved and common intention is absent, section 34 cannot be invoked.204. The co-accused was standing outside the house, where the incident took place, while the others committed the   murder. There is no evidence of his having played any part in the crime. He did not even act as a guard; he did not prevent the witness from entering the house. There is no evidence of the formation or sharing of any common intention with the other accused. No weapon was seized from him, nor was any property connected with the crime, conﬁscated from him. It was therefore, held that, it was not safe to convict the coaccused of the offence of murder with the aid of sub-sections 34 and 120(B).205."

            "sub_section_description": "Physical presence at the very spot is not always a necessary ingredient to attract the action. The Supreme Court decision in Shreekantiah Ramayya v State of Bombay,206. is the authority for the aforesaid proposition. Vivian Bose, J, speaking for the Bench of three Judges stated thus: He need not be present in the actual room; he can, for instance, stand guard by a gate outside ready to warn his companions about any approach of danger or wait in a car on a nearby road ready to facilitate their escape.  What is required is his actual participation in the commission of the offence in some way or other at the time when the crime is actually being committed. The participation need not in all cases be by physical presence. In offence involving physical violence, normally presence at the scene of offence may be necessary, but such is not the case in respect of other offences when the offence consists of diverse acts which may be done at different times and places. The physical presence at the scene of offence of the offender sough to be rendered liable under this section is not one of the conditions of its applicability in every case.207. Even the concept of presence of the co-accused at the scene is not a necessary requirement to attract section 34 of the IPC, 1860, e.g., the co-accused can remain a little away and supply weapons to the participating accused either by throwing or by catapulting them so that the participating accused can inﬂict injuries on the targeted person. There may be other provisions in the IPC, 1860 like subsections 120B or 109 which could be invoked then to catch such non-participating accused. Thus, participation in the crime in furtherance of the common intention is sine qua non for section 34 IPC, 1860. Exhortation to other accused, even guarding the scene etc. would amount to participation. Of course, when the allegation against an accused is that he participated in the crime by oral exhortation or by guarding the scene the court has to evaluate the evidence very carefully for deciding whether that person had really done any such act.208. The absence of any overt act of assault, exhortation or possession of weapon cannot be singularly determinative of absence of common intention.209."

            "sub_section_description": "The common intention can be inferred from the circumstances of the case and that the intention can be gathered from the circumstances as they arise even during an incident.230. Common intention is a state of mind. It is not possible to read a person's mind. There can hardly be direct evidence of common intention. The existence or nonexistence of a common intention amongst the accused has to be deciphered cumulatively from their conduct and behaviour in the facts and circumstances of each case. Events prior to the occurrence as also after, and during the occurrence, are all relevant to deduce if there existed any common intention. There can be no straight jacket formula.231. The Court has to examine the prosecution evidence in regard to application of section 34 cumulatively and if the ingredients are satisﬁed, the consequences must follow. It is diﬃcult to state any hard and fast rule which can be applied universally to all cases. It will always depend on the facts and circumstances of the given case whether the person involved in the commission of the crime with a common intention can be held guilty of the main offence committed by them together.232. Courts, in most cases, have to infer the intention from the act(s) or conduct of the accused or other relevant circumstances of the case. However, an inference as to the common intention shall not be readily drawn; the criminal liability can arise only when such inference can be drawn with a certain degree of assurance.233. In most cases it has to be inferred from the act or conduct or other relevant circumstances of the case in hand.234. This inference can be gathered by the manner in which the accused arrived on the scene and mounted the attack, the determination and concert with which the beating was given or the injuries caused by one or some of them, the acts done by others to assist those causing the injuries, the concerted conduct subsequent to the commission of the offence, for instance all of them left the scene of the incident together and other acts which all or some may have done as would help in determining the common intention. In other words, the totality of the circumstances must be taken into consideration in arriving at the conclusion whether the accused had a common intention to commit an offence of which they could be convicted.235. Manner of attack shows the common intention of accused.236. The Supreme Court has reiterated: We reiterate that for common intention, there could rarely be direct evidence. The ultimate decision, at any rate would invariably depend upon the inference deducible from the circumstances of each case. It is settled law that the common intention or the intention of the individuals concerned in furtherance of the common intention could be proved either   from direct evidence or by inference from the acts or attending circumstances of the case and conduct of the parties.237."

Where the appellants caused injuries not enough to cause the death but the same were caused by another, in the absence of a charge under section 34, they were found to be guilty under section 326 of IPC, 1860.240. Sections 34, 114 and 149 of the IPC, 1860 provide for criminal liability viewed from different angles as regards actual participants, accessories and men actuated by a common object or a common intention; and as explained by ﬁve Judge Constitution Bench of in Willie Slavey v The State of MP,241. the charge is a rolled-up one involving the direct liability and the constructive liability without specifying who are directly liable and who are sought to be made constructively liable.242. But before a court can convict a person under section 302, read with section 34, of the Indian Penal Code, it should come to a deﬁnite conclusion that the said person had a prior concert with one or more other persons, named or unnamed, for committing the said offence. A few illustrations will bring out the impact of section 34 on different situations. (1) A, B, C and D are charged under section 302, read with section 34, of the Indian Penal Code, for committing the murder of E. The evidence is directed to establish that the said four persons have taken part in the murder. (2) A, B, C and D and unnamed others are charged under the said sections. But evidence is adduced to prove that the said persons, along with others, named or unnamed, participated jointly in the commission of that offence. (3) A, B, C and D are charged under the said sections. But the evidence is directed to prove that A, B, C and D, along with 3 others, have jointly committed the offence. As regards the third illustration, a Court is certainly entitled to come to the conclusion that one of the named accused is guilty of murder under section 302, read with section 34, of the Indian Penal Code, though the other three named accused are acquitted, if it accepts the evidence that the said accused acted in concert along with persons, named or unnamed, other than those acquitted, in the commission of the offence. In the second illustration the Court can come to the same conclusion and convict one of the named accused if it is satisﬁed that no prejudice has been caused to the accused by the defect in the charge. But in the ﬁrst illustration the Court certainly can convict two or more of the named accused if it accepts the evidence that they acted conjointly in committing the offence. But what is the position if the Court acquits 3 of the 4 accused either because it rejects the prosecution evidence or because it gives the beneﬁt of doubt to the said accused? Can it hold, in the absence of a charge as well as evidence, that though the three accused are acquitted, some other unidentiﬁed persons acted conjointly along with one of the named persons? If the Court could do so, it would be making out a new case for the prosecution: it would be deciding contrary to the evidence adduced in the case. A Court cannot obviously make out a case for the prosecution which is not disclosed either in the charge or in regard to which there is no basis in the evidence. There must be some foundation in the evidence that persons other than those named have taken part in the commission of the offence and if there   is such a basis the case will be covered by the third illustration.243. Absence of charge under section 34 is not fatal by itself unless prejudice to the accused is shown.244."

(ii) Some active participation, especially in a crime involving physical violence is  necessary under section 34 but section 149, IPC, 1860, does not require it and the liability arises by reason of mere membership of the unlawful assembly with a common object and there may be no active participation at all in the preparation and commission of the crime. (iii) Section 34 speaks of common intention but section 149, IPC, 1860,  contemplates common object which is undoubtedly wider in its scope and amplitude than intention. If the offence committed by a member of an unlawful assembly is in prosecution of the common object of the unlawful assembly or such as the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of the common object, all other members of the unlawful assembly would be guilty of that offence under section 149, IPC, 1860, although they may not have intended to do it or participated in the actual commission of that offence.246.

Though all the accused would be liable for committing the murder of a person by doing an act or acts in furtherance of the common intention, they would not be liable for the act or acts if they had the right of private defence to voluntarily cause death of that person. Common intention, therefore, has relevance only to the offence and not to the right of private defence. What would be an offence by reason of constructive liability would cease to be one if the act constituting the offence was done in exercise of the right of private defence. If the voluntary causing of death is not permissible under the right of private defence under section 96, then the common intention in regard thereto will lead to the result that the accused persons must be held guilty by reason of constructive liability under the relevant section (in this case section 304 Part I IPC, 1860). If, however, the common intention was only to commit an act which was permissible within the conﬁnes of s. 96 read with s. 98, then constructive liability under section 34 cannot be said to have been accrued to the accused.

ILLUSTRATIONS (a) A and B agree to murder Z by severally and at different times giving him small  doses of poison. A and B administer the poison according to the agreement with intent to murder Z. Z dies from the effects of the several doses of poison so administered to him. Here A and B intentionally co-operate in the commission of murder and as each of them does an act by which the death is caused, they are both guilty of the offence though their acts are separate. (b) A and B are joint jailors, and as such have the charge of Z, a prisoner,  alternatively for six hours at a time. A and B, intending to cause Z's death, knowingly co-operate in causing that effect by illegally omitting, each during the time of his attendance, to furnish Z with food supplied to them for that purpose, Z dies of hunger. Both A and B are guilty of the murder of Z. (c) A, a jailor, has the charge of a prisoner. A, intending to cause Z's death, illegally  omits to supply Z with food; in consequence of which Z is much reduced in strength, but the starvation is not suﬃcient to cause his death. A is dismissed from his oﬃce, and B succeeds him. B, without collusion or co-operation with A, illegally omits to supply Z with food, knowing that he is likely thereby to cause Z's death. Z dies of hunger. B is guilty of murder, but, as A did not co-operate with B. A is guilty only of an attempt to commit murder.  COMMENT— This section follows as a corollary from section 35 as appears from the illustrations. It provides that, when several acts are done so as to result together in the commission of an offence, the doing of any one of them, with an intention to co-operate in the offence (which may not be the same as an intention common to all), makes the actor liable to be punished for the commission of the offence.268. By co-operating in the doing of several acts which together constitute a single criminal act, each person who cooperates in the commission of that offence by doing any one of the acts is either singly or jointly liable for that offence.269. If common intention is the hub of section 34, intentional cooperation is the spindle of section 37 of the Penal Code. One who shares common intention can as well cooperate in the commission of the offence   intentionally. In that sense the two sections are not contradictory to each other. The former does not necessarily exclude the latter. Co-operation in the commission of the offence need not be for the entire gamut of the offence committed. It is enough if he cooperates in one of the several acts which constitute the offence. Sections 34–38 of the Penal Code delineate the parameters of constructive or vicarious penal liability in different situations. Therefore, it is not imperative that the charge should contain the particular section of the Penal Code with which constructive liability is fastened.270.",

ILLUSTRATION A attacks Z under such circumstances of grave provocation that his killing of Z would be only culpable homicide not amounting to murder. B, having ill-will towards Z and intending to kill him, and not having been subject to the provocation, assists A in killing Z. Here, though A and B are both engaged in causing Z's death, B is guilty of murder, and A is guilty only of culpable homicide.  COMMENT— Section 38 provides that the responsibility for the completed criminal act may be of different grades according to the share taken by the different accused in the completion of the criminal act and this section does not mention anything about intention common or otherwise or knowledge.271. Sections 34–38 lay down principles similar to the English law of 'principals in the ﬁrst and second degrees.' See Comment on section 107. The basic principle which runs through sections 32 to 38 is that in certain circumstances an entire act is attributed to a person who may have performed only a fractional part of it. This axiom is laid down in section 34 in which emphasis are on the act. Sections 35–38 take up this axiom as the basis of a further rule by which the criminal liability of the doer of a fractional part (who is to be taken as the doer of the entire act) is to be adjudged in different situations of mens rea. Without the axiom itself, however, the other sections would not work, inasmuch as it is the foundation on which they all stand.272. This section provides for different punishments for different offences as an alternative to one punishment for one offence, whether the persons engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal act are set in motion by the one intention or by the other.273.

Where three accused assaulted the deceased but only two used their weapons in a determined manner which clearly showed their common intention to kill the deceased and the third accused who had a lathi in his hand did not even use it to cause any injury to the victim, it was held that the former two were liable to be convicted under section 302 read with section 34, IPC, 1860, and the third accused was only liable under section 304, Part II read with section 38, IPC, 1860, as he had intentionally joined the   other two in the commission of the act with the knowledge that the assault was likely to cause death of the deceased even though he did not have the intention to kill him.275.",

A person is said to cause an effect \"voluntarily\" when he causes it by means whereby he intended to cause it, or by means which, at the time of employing those means, he knew or had reason to believe to be likely to cause it. ILLUSTRATION A sets ﬁre, by night, to an inhabited house in a large town, for the purpose of facilitating a robbery and thus causes the death of a person. Here, A may not have intended to cause death; and may even be sorry that death has been caused by his act; yet, if he knew that he was likely to cause death, he has caused death voluntarily.

If an act is the probable consequence of the means used by him, he is said to have caused it voluntarily whether he really means to cause it or not. Section implicitly lays down the principle that a man is presumed to intend the probable consequences of his act.276. Following this it has been held that if the accused was not aware that the person whom they conﬁned was a public servant, section 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty) would not be attracted. The accused would be guilty of causing hurt under section 323.277. The Supreme Court has given a new meaning to the word \"voluntary\" by holding in Olga Tellis v Bombay MC,278. that the act of slum dwellers putting up their huts on public footpaths and pavements cannot be described to be \"voluntary\" for the purposes of the deﬁnition of \"criminal trespass\" in section 441, it being the result of utter helplessness and their moral right of survival.",

Thus, the deﬁnition of 'offence' under section 2(n), Cr PC, 1973, is wider enough to enable the police to investigate into offences under other enactments also, apart from those under the IPC, 1860.287. An offence seldom consists of a single act. It is usually composed of several elements and, as a rule; a whole series of acts must be proved before it can be established.288. There is a basic difference between the offences under the Penal Code and acts and omissions which have been made punishable under different Acts and statutes which are in nature of social welfare legislations. For framing charges in respect of those acts and omissions, in many cases, mens rea is not an essential ingredient; the concerned statute imposes a duty on those who are in charge of the management, to follow the statutory provisions and once there is a breach or contravention, such persons become liable to be punished. But for framing a charge for an offence under the Penal Code, the   traditional rule of existence of mens rea is to be followed.289.

In the main clause of the said section it has been clearly set out that the word \"offence\" denotes a thing made punishable by this Code except the chapters and sections mentioned in clauses 2 and 3 of the said section. Therefore, going by the main clause of section 40, the word \"offence\" since denotes the thing made punishable under the Code, 'other offence' mentioned in section 141 'third', can only denote to offences, which are punishable under any of the provisions of the Code. Therefore, by applying the main clause of section 40, it can be straight away held that all offences referred to in any of the provisions of the Code for which the punishment is provided for would automatically fall within the expression \"other offence\", which has been used in section 141 'third'. Therefore, a conspectus reading of section 40 makes the position abundantly clear that for all offences punishable under the Indian Penal Code, the main clause of section 40 would straight away apply in which event the expression \"other offence\" used in section 141 'third', will have to be construed as any offence for which punishment is prescribed under the Code. To put it differently, whosoever is proceeded against for any offence punishable under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code, section 40 sub-clause 1 would straight away apply for the purpose of construing what the offence is and when it comes to the question of offence under any other special or local law, the aid of sub-clause 2 and 3 will have to be applied for the purpose of construing the offence for which the accused is proceeded against. Therefore, having regard to sub-clause 1 of section 40 of the Code read along with section 141 'third', the argument of learned senior counsel for the Appellants will have to be rejected.

And in sections 141, 176, 177, 201, 202, 212, 216 and 441, the word \"offence\" has the same meaning when the thing punishable under the special or local law is punishable under such law with imprisonment for a term of six months or upwards, whether with or without ﬁne.]  COMMENT— \"Offence\" means 'an act or instance of offending'; 'commit an illegal act' and illegal means, 'contrary to or forbidden by law'. \"Offence\" has to be read and understood in the context as it has been prescribed under the provisions of sub-section 40, 41 and 42 IPC, 1860 which cover the offences punishable under IPC, 1860 or under special or local law or as deﬁned under section 2(n) Cr PC, 1973 or section 3(38) of the General Clauses Act 1897. There is no statutory offence that takes place when adults willingly engage in sexual relations outside the marital setting, with the exception of 'adultery' as deﬁned under section 497 IPC, 1860.285. In Joseph Shine v UOI286. a ﬁve judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court struck down section 497 of the Indian Penal Code as manifestly discriminatory and arbitrary. Section 2(n) of Cr PC, 1973 deﬁnes offence as any act or omission made punishable by any law for the time being in force and includes any act in respect of which a complaint may be under section 20 of the Cattle Trespass Act 1871 (1 of 1871). Thus, the deﬁnition of 'offence' under section 2(n), Cr PC, 1973, is wider enough to enable the police to investigate into offences under other enactments also, apart from those under the IPC, 1860.287. An offence seldom consists of a single act. It is usually composed of several elements and, as a rule; a whole series of acts must be proved before it can be established.288. There is a basic difference between the offences under the Penal Code and acts and omissions which have been made punishable under different Acts and statutes which are in nature of social welfare legislations. For framing charges in respect of those acts and omissions, in many cases, mens rea is not an essential ingredient; the concerned statute imposes a duty on those who are in charge of the management, to follow the statutory provisions and once there is a breach or contravention, such persons become liable to be punished. But for framing a charge for an offence under the Penal Code, the   traditional rule of existence of mens rea is to be followed.289. In the absence of a deﬁnition in a special act, the term 'offence' should be understood in the context of section 40 of the Indian Penal Code as an act that is criminally punishable and section 3(38) of the General Clauses Act as an act made punishable by any law and the essential ingredient is that it should be a criminal act as understood.290. In Naz Foundation v NCT Delhi.291. section 377 of IPC, 1860 in so far it criminalised consensual sexual acts of adults in private, was held violative of Article 21, Article 14 and Article 15 of the Constitution by the Delhi High Court.292.

            "sub_section_description": "Section 40 speciﬁcally mentions as to how the term 'offence' will have to be construed. In the main clause of the said section it has been clearly set out that the word \"offence\" denotes a thing made punishable by this Code except the chapters and sections mentioned in clauses 2 and 3 of the said section. Therefore, going by the main clause of section 40, the word \"offence\" since denotes the thing made punishable under the Code, 'other offence' mentioned in section 141 'third', can only denote to offences, which are punishable under any of the provisions of the Code. Therefore, by applying the main clause of section 40, it can be straight away held that all offences referred to in any of the provisions of the Code for which the punishment is provided for would automatically fall within the expression \"other offence\", which has been used in section 141 'third'. Therefore, a conspectus reading of section 40 makes the position abundantly clear that for all offences punishable under the Indian Penal Code, the main clause of section 40 would straight away apply in which event the expression \"other offence\" used in section 141 'third', will have to be construed as any offence for which punishment is prescribed under the Code. To put it differently, whosoever is proceeded against for any offence punishable under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code, section 40 sub-clause 1 would straight away apply for the purpose of construing what the offence is and when it comes to the question of offence under any other special or local law, the aid of sub-clause 2 and 3 will have to be applied for the purpose of construing the offence for which the accused is proceeded against. Therefore, having regard to sub-clause 1 of section 40 of the Code read along with section 141 'third', the argument of learned senior counsel for the Appellants will have to be rejected. Only such a construction would be in tune with the purport and intent of the law makers while deﬁning an unlawful assembly for commission of an offence with a common object, as speciﬁed under section 141 of the Code.302."

            "sub_section_description": "The burden is on the accused to prove this fact. Whether a person took due care and attention before he made the imputation is a matter most often within the personal knowledge of that person himself. The accused must prove that he made due enquiries before he published the imputation. It is not enough to say that he made a formal enquiry in a slipshod manner. The words 'due care and attention' imply that the accused must have made the enquiry in a reasonable manner with all circumspection. It is true that the accused is not bound to prove that the enquiry made by him was fool-proof or without the possibility of any error or chance of mistake. However, the accused must show that he got the information from proper source and he had reasonable grounds to   believe the truth of the statement he made. The accused must prove by preponderance of probability that there was good faith on his part. The accused also should show that there was no malice on his part, that is to say, that there was no ill-will or spite towards the person against whom he made the imputation. What must ultimately be decided is the honesty of the accused in publishing the words complained of. So also the accused are not entitled to exception 9 of section 499, IPC, 1860 merely on the reason that the publications were not made in good faith.335. Good faith is a question of fact to be considered and decided on the facts of each case. Section 52 of the Penal Code emphasizes due care and attention in relation to the good faith. In the General Clauses Act emphasis is laid on honesty.336. The meaning of the expression \"good faith\" is what is done with \"due care and attention\". Due care denotes the degree of reasonableness in the care sought to be exercised. So, before a person proposes to make an imputation, he must ﬁrst make an enquiry into the factum of the imputation which he proposes to make. It is not enough that he does just a make believe show for an enquiry. The enquiry expected of him is of such a depth as a reasonable and prudent man would make with the genuine intention in knowing the real truth of the imputation. If he does not do so he cannot claim that what he did was bona ﬁde i.e. done in good faith. Thus, a contemner, if he is to establish \"good faith\" has to say that he conducted a reasonable and proper enquiry before making an imputation.337. The question of good faith must be considered with reference to the position of the accused and the circumstances under which he acted. 'Good faith' requires not logical infallibility but due care and attention.338."

Some attempts have been made to modernise our penal system through piecemeal legislation at best for the ﬁrst offenders, the children and the juvenile delinquents example the Probation of Offenders Act 1958, the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2000, Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 etc. In the Indian Penal Code, there is no scope for individualising the punishment; rather these ﬁve forms of punishment have to be doled out to the offenders irrespective of their psycho-social problems and needs of individual offenders. Commenting on this unhappy aspect of our penal system Krishna iyer, J, observed in Shivaji's case'.3. Two men in their twenties thus stand convicted of murder and have to suffer imprisonment for life because the punitive strategy of our Penal Code does not suﬃciently reﬂect the modern trends in correctional treatment and personalised sentencing. When accused persons are of tender age then even in a murder case it is not desirable to send them beyond the high prison walls and forget all about their correction and eventual reformation.  In Inder Singh's case4. the Supreme Court issued directions to the State Government to see that the young accused of the case are not given any degrading work and they are given the beneﬁt of liberal parole every year if their behaviour shows responsibility and trustworthiness. Moreover, the Sessions Judge was directed to make jail visits to ensure compliance with these directions.",

Undue sympathy by means of imposing inadequate sentence would do more harm to the justice system and undermine the public conﬁdence in the eﬃcacy of law.6. The object should be to protect the society and to deter the criminal in achieving the avowed object to law by imposing appropriate sentence. It is expected that the Courts would operate the sentencing system so as to impose such sentence which reﬂects the conscience of the society and the sentencing process has to be stern where it should be.7. The main purpose of the sentence broadly stated is that the accused must realise that he has committed an act which is not only harmful to the society of which he forms an integral part but is also harmful to his own future, both as an individual and as a member of the society. Punishment is designed to protect society by deterring potential offenders as also by preventing the guilty party from repeating the offence; it is also designed to reform the offender and re-claim him as a law-abiding citizen for the good of the society as a whole. Reformatory, deterrent and punitive aspects of punishment thus play their due part in judicial thinking while determining this question. In modern civilized societies, however, reformatory aspect is being given somewhat greater importance. Too lenient as well as too harsh sentences both lose their eﬃcaciousness. One does not deter and the other may frustrate thereby making the offender a hardened criminal.8."

            "sub_section_description": "Punishment in criminal cases is both punitive and reformative. The purpose is that the person found guilty of committing the offence is made to realise his fault and is deterred from repeating such acts in future. On the commission of crime, three types of reactions may generate; the traditional reaction of universal nature which is termed as punitive approach. It regards the criminal as a notoriously dangerous person who must be inﬂicted severe punishment to protect the society from his criminal assaults. The other approach is the therapeutic approach. It regards the criminal as a sick person requiring treatment, while the third is the preventive approach, which seeks to eliminate those conditions from the society, which were responsible for crime causation. Under the punitive approach, the rationalisation of punishment is based on retributive and utilitarian theories. Deterrent theory, which is also part of the punitive approach, proceeds on the basis that the punishment should act as a deterrent not only to the offender, but also to others in the community. The therapeutic approach aims at curing the criminal tendencies, which were the product of a diseased psychology. Therapeutic approach has since been treated as an effective method of punishment, which not only satisﬁes the requirements of law that a criminal should be punished and the punishment prescribed must be meted out to him, but also reforms the criminal through various processes, the most fundamental of which is that in spite of having committed a crime, may be a heinous crime, he should be treated as a human being entitled to all the basic human rights, human dignity and human sympathy. It was under this theory that this Court in a stream of decisions, projected the need for prison reforms, the need to acknowledge the vital fact that the prisoner, after being lodged in jail, does not lose his fundamental rights or basic human rights and that he must be treated with compassion and sympathy.9. Imposing a hard punishment on the accused serves a limited purpose, but at the same time, it is to be kept in mind that relevance of deterrent punishment in matters of serious crimes affecting society should not be undermined. Within the parameters of the law an attempt has to be made to afford an opportunity to the individual to reform himself and lead life of a normal, useful member of society and make his contribution in that regard.10. In Dhannajoy Chatterjee v State of WB,11. the Supreme Court has observed that shockingly large number of criminals go unpunished, thereby increasingly encouraging the criminals and ultimately making justice suffer by weakening the system's credibility. Realising that it is not the brutality of punishment but its surety that serves as a greater deterrent, our Supreme Court held   that a barbaric crime does not have to be visited with a barbaric penalty such as public hanging which will be clearly violative of Article 21 of the Constitution.12. With regards the question of punishment, it should be noted that punishment in one matter cannot be the guiding factor for punishment in another. Punishment has a co-relation with facts and in each case where punishment is imposed, the same must be the resultant effect of the acts complained of. More serious the violation, more severe is the punishment and that has been the accepted norm, in matters though, however, within the prescribed limits.13."

Theory of reformation through punishment is grounded on the sublime philosophy that every man is born good but circumstances transform him into a criminal. The aphorism that \"if every saint has a past every sinner has a future\" is a tested philosophy concerning human life. VR Krishna Iyer, J, has taken pains to ornately fresco the reformative proﬁle of the principles of sentencing in Mohammad Giasuddin v State of AP.15. Reformation should hence be the dominant objective of a punishment and during incarceration, every effort should be made to recreate the good man out of convicted prisoner. An assurance to him that his hard labour would eventually snowball into a handsome saving for his own rehabilitation would help him to get stripped of the moroseness and desperation in his mind while toiling with the rigours of hard labour during the period of his jail life. Thus, reformation and rehabilitation of a prisoner are of great public policy. Hence, they serve a public purpose.16. Punishment is also to reform such wrongdoers not to commit such offence in future.17."

            "sub_section_name": "Deterrence.—",
            "sub_section_description": "Deterrence is one of the vital considerations of punishment. Law demands that the offender should be adequately punished for the crime, so that it can deter the offender and other persons from committing similar offences. Nature and circumstances of the offence; the need for the sentence imposed to reﬂect the seriousness of the offence; to afford adequate deterrence to the conduct and to protect the public from such crimes are certain factors to be considered while imposing the sentence.18. Any liberal attitude by imposing meagre sentences or taking too sympathetic view merely on account of lapse of time or personal inconveniences in respect of such offences will be result-wise counterproductive in the long run and against societal interest which needs to be cared for and strengthened by string of deterrence built in the sentencing system.19. For instance, a murder committed due to deep-seated mutual and personal rivalry may not call for penalty of death. However, an organised crime or mass murders of innocent people would call for imposition of death sentence as deterrence.20. Protection of society and deterring the criminal is the avowed object of law and is required to be achieved by imposing an appropriate sentence. The sentencing Courts are expected to consider all relevant facts and circumstances bearing on the question of sentence and proceed to impose a sentence commensurate with the gravity of the offence. Courts must hear the loud cry for justice by the society in cases of heinous crimes like rape on innocent helpless girls of tender years, as in this case, and respond by imposition of proper sentence. Public abhorrence of the crime needs reﬂection through imposition of appropriate sentence by the Court. To show mercy in the case of such a heinous crime would be a travesty of justice.21. To give a lesser punishment to the appellants would be to render the justice system of this country suspect. The common man will lose   faith in the Courts. In such cases, he understands and appreciates the language of deterrence more than the reformative jargon.22. Punishment to an accused in criminal jurisprudence is not merely to punish the wrongdoer but also to strike warning to those who are in the same sphere of crime or to those intending to join in such crime.23."

            "sub_section_name": "Principles of sentencing.—",
            "sub_section_description": "Sentencing is an important task in the matters of crime. There is no straitjacket formula for sentencing an accused on proof of crime. In practice, there is much variance in the matter of sentencing. In many countries, there are laws prescribing sentencing guidelines, but there is no statutory sentencing policy in India.24. The Indian Penal Code provides discretion to Indian Judges while awarding the sentence.25. Courts have wide discretion in awarding sentence within the statutory limits.26. The Courts have evolved certain principles: twin objective of the sentencing policy is deterrence and correction.27. There are many philosophies behind sentencing justifying penal consequences. The philosophical/jurisprudential justiﬁcation can be retribution, incapacitation, speciﬁc deterrence, general deterrence, rehabilitation, or restoration. Anyone or a combination thereof can be the goal of sentencing. However, when it comes to sentencing a person for committing a heinous crime, the deterrence theory as a rationale for punishing the offender becomes more relevant. In such cases, the role of mercy, forgiveness and compassion becomes secondary and while determining the quantum of sentence, discretion lies with the Court. While exercising such a discretion, the Court has to govern itself by reason and fair play, and discretion is not to be exercised according to whim and caprice. It is the duty of the Court to impose adequate sentence, for one of the purposes of imposition of requisite sentence is protection of the society and a legitimate response to the collective conscience. While considering as to what would be the appropriate quantum of imprisonment, the Court is empowered to take into consideration mitigating circumstances, as well as aggravating circumstances.28. What sentence would meet the ends of justice depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and the Court must keep in mind the gravity of the crime, motive for the crime, nature of the offence and all other attendant circumstances.29. The criminal law adheres in general to the principle of proportionality in prescribing liability according to the culpability of each kind of criminal conduct. It ordinarily allows some signiﬁcant discretion to the Judge in arriving at a sentence in each case, presumably to permit sentences that reﬂect more subtle considerations of culpability that are raised by the special facts of each case. Judges in essence aﬃrm that punishment ought always to ﬁt the crime; yet in practice, sentences are determined largely by other considerations. Sometimes it is the correctional needs of the perpetrator that are offered to justify a sentence, sometimes the desirability of keeping him out of circulation, and sometimes even the tragic results of his crime. Inevitably, these considerations cause a departure from just desert as the basis of punishment and create cases of apparent injustice that are serious and widespread.30. Proportion between crime and punishment is a goal respected in principle, and in spite of errant notions, it remains a strong inﬂuence in the determination of sentences. The practice of punishing all serious crimes with equal severity is now unknown in civilized societies, but such a radical departure from the principle of proportionality has disappeared from the law only in recent times. Even now for a single grave infraction, drastic sentences are imposed. Anything less than a penalty of greatest severity for any serious crime is thought then to be a measure of toleration that is unwarranted and unwise. But in fact, quite apart from those considerations that make punishment unjustiﬁable when it is out of proportion to the crime, uniformly disproportionate punishment has some very undesirable practical consequences.31. The principle of proportionality in sentencing a crime doer is well entrenched in criminal jurisprudence.   As a matter of law, proportion between crime and punishment bears most relevant inﬂuence in determination of sentencing the crime doer. The Court has to take into consideration all aspects including social interest and consciousness of the society for award of appropriate sentence.32. Undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would do more harm to the justice system to undermine the public conﬁdence in the eﬃcacy of law and society could not long endure under such serious threats. Imposition of sentence without considering its effect on the social order in many cases may be in reality a futile exercise. The social impact of the crime e.g. where it relates to offences against women, dacoity, kidnapping, misappropriation of public money, treason and other offences involving moral turpitude or moral delinquency which have great impact on social order and public interest, cannot be lost sight of and per se require exemplary treatment. Any liberal attitude by imposing meagre sentences or taking too sympathetic view merely on account of lapse of time in respect of such offences will be result wise counterproductive in the long run and against societal interest which needs to be cared for and strengthened by a string of deterrence inbuilt in the sentencing system.33. Undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would do more harm to the justice system to undermine the public conﬁdence in the eﬃcacy of law and society could not long endure under such serious threats. It is, therefore, the duty of every Court to award proper sentence keeping in mind the nature of the offence and the manner in which it was executed or committed etc. Thus, it is evident that Criminal Law requires strict adherence to the rule of proportionality in providing punishment according to the culpability of each kind of criminal conduct keeping in mind the effect of not awarding just punishment on the society.34. An undeserved indulgence or liberal attitude in not awarding adequate sentence in such cases would amount to allowing or even to encouraging 'potential criminals'. The society can no longer endure under such serious threats. Courts must hear the loud cry for justice by society in cases of heinous crime of rape and impose adequate sentence. Public abhorrence of the crime needs reﬂection through imposition of appropriate sentence by the Court.35."

The relevant factors are as under: (a) Motive or previous enmity; (b) Whether the incident had taken place on the spur of the moment; (c) The intention/knowledge of the accused while inﬂicting the blow or injury; (d) Whether the death ensued instantaneously or the victim died after several days; (e) The gravity, dimension and nature of injury; (f) The age and general health condition of the accused; (g) Whether the injury was caused without pre-meditation in a sudden ﬁght; (h) The nature and size of weapon used for inﬂicting the injury and the force with which the blow was inﬂicted; (i) The criminal background and adverse history of the accused;   (j) Whether the injury inﬂicted was not suﬃcient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death but the death was because of shock; (k) Number of other criminal cases pending against the accused; (l) Incident occurred within the family members or close relations; (m) The conduct and behaviour of the accused after the incident.

The list of circumstances enumerated above is only illustrative and not exhaustive. In our considered view, proper and appropriate sentence to the accused is the bounded obligation and duty of the Court. The endeavour of the Court must be to ensure that the accused receives appropriate sentence, in other words, sentence should be according to the gravity of the offence. These are some of the relevant factors which are required to be kept in view while convicting and sentencing the accused.36. The facts and given circumstances in each case, the nature of the crime, the manner in which it was planned and committed, the motive for commission of the crime, the conduct of the accused, the nature of weapons used and all other attending circumstances are relevant facts which would enter into the area of consideration.37."

Since in many offences, only the maximum punishment is prescribed and for some offences the minimum punishment is prescribed, each Judge exercises his discretion accordingly.39. In case where for an offence, maximum imprisonment is prescribed and there is no provision for minimum imprisonment, the Court can exercise wide discretion imposing any imprisonment which may be from one day (or even till the rising of the court) to ten years/life.40. However, the Courts will have to take into account certain principles while exercising their discretion in sentencing, such as proportionality, deterrence and rehabilitation. In a proportionality analysis, it is necessary to assess the seriousness of an offence in order to determine the commensurate punishment for the offender.41. Though punishment is the discretion of the Court, yet it must be exercised judicially and where circumstances call for a deterrent punishment, it ought to be awarded in an appropriate case.42. Thus where the accused, a young man of 22 committed multiple murders for sheer gain in a most cruel, callous and ﬁendish fashion, there was no way to show him any mercy as it was rarest of the rare cases where a sentence of death was fully justiﬁed.43. In exercising this discretion, the Court must consider the gravity of the offence, the mitigating or the extenuating circumstances of the case which may justify the award of the lesser or maximum sentence.44. Where the accused was a youth of 19, the Supreme Court while upholding conviction under section 304-Part I, Indian Penal Code, 1860, (IPC, 1860) reduced his sentence to the period already undergone which was 18 and a half months in the instant case. The accused, a Government servant, who will lose pensionary beneﬁts due to conviction, deserves to be treated leniently. The Supreme Court has laid down that in cases of death in custody on account of third degree methods, deterrent punishment should be awarded.45. Where certain police oﬃcials, who took a man illegally in their custody and gave him beating due to which he   died, were convicted under section 342, it was held that the facts that one of the accused was recipient of a medal from the President for saving a life, was awarded Rs. 5,000 by the State Government also and was suffering from T.B. and the other accused had acted on the direction of his superior, were not mitigating circumstances and the accused were liable to be punished with the maximum sentence.46. Where due to dire poverty the accused killed his ailing wife, as he could not provide money for her operation and thereafter killed his two children, as they would be neglected after their mother's death, it was held the accused deserved to be awarded life imprisonment and not capital punishment.47. Where the murder in question showed signs of ruthless, unrelenting and determined vindictiveness and though the accused was 55 at the time of occurrence and 70 at the time of this appeal, the Supreme Court did not think it necessary to modify his sentence of life imprisonment.48. Similarly, where murders were committed for gain, the Supreme Court refused to interfere with death sentence only because the condemned prisoners were very young and their wives and children and aged parents were dependent on them. Such considerations, the Court said, are present in most cases.49. Where, for the offence of dacoity under section 395, the trial Court awarded three years' R.I., the High Court acquitted the offenders, but the Supreme Court restored the conviction after a long gap during which they got married and had resumed normal life, the period already undergone was considered to be suﬃcient, but a ﬁne of Rs. 3,000 was imposed on each of them.50. Where a conviction under section 16I, IPC, 1860 read with section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 was conﬁrmed, the Gujarat High Court modiﬁed the sentence of R.I. for one year and ordered that the appellant shall undergo sentence of R.I. for six months only. This was done in view of his age of 60 years and a number of illnesses he was suffering from.51. The accused had been out of job for nearly 16 years and had undergone the trial for a number of years. He was 65 years old but had received no pension and had a large family to maintain. Hence, the Supreme Court while conﬁrming the conviction, reduced the sentence of one year R.I. each under section 161 and the Prevention of Corruption Act to 15 days R.I. on each count. The sentence of ﬁne was however conﬁrmed.52. Where the accused had accepted a very small amount of Rs. 30 as bribe about 16 years back and underwent the agony of trial for a long time and had to support his family, he had been in jail for some time during trial, considering these facts his sentence of imprisonment was reduced from three months R.I. to the period already undergone.53. Imposition of proper and appropriate sentence is bounded obligation and duty of the Court. The endeavour of the Court must be to ensure that the accused received appropriate sentence. The sentence must be accorded to the gravity of the offence.54."

Rigorous imprisonment is one which is required by law to be completed with hard labour. There are principally two categories of prisoners: (1) under trial prisoners and (2) convicted prisoners (Besides them there are those detained as preventive measure, and those undergoing detention for default of payment of ﬁne). A person sentenced to simple imprisonment cannot be required to work unless he volunteers himself to do the work. However, the Jail oﬃcer who requires a prisoner   sentenced to rigorous imprisonment to do hard labour would be doing so as enjoined by law and mandated by the Court.68. Thus, while a person sentenced to simple imprisonment has the option of choosing to work, a person sentenced to rigorous imprisonment is required by law to undergo hard labour. The under trials are not required to work in Jail.69. Section 60 of the Indian Penal Code confers power on a sentencing Court to direct that \"such imprisonment shall be wholly rigorous or that such imprisonment shall be wholly simple, or that any part of such imprisonment shall be rigorous and the rest simple.\" The sentence of \"imprisonment for life\" tagged along with a number of offences delineated in the IPC, 1860 is interpreted as \"rigorous imprisonment for life\" and not simple imprisonment.70. Supreme Court Guidelines regarding employment of prisoners and wages.— (1) It is lawful to employ the prisoners sentenced to rigorous imprisonment to do hard labour whether he consents to do it or not. (2) It is open to the jail oﬃcials to permit other prisoners also to do any work which they choose to do provided such prisoners make a request for that purpose. (3) It is imperative that the prisoner should be paid equitable wages for the work done by them. In order to determine the quantum of equitable wages payable to prisoners the State concerned shall constitute a wage ﬁxation body for making recommendations. We direct each State to do so as early as possible. (4) Until the State Government takes any decision on such recommendations every prisoner must be paid wages for the work done by him at such rates or revised rates as the Government concerned ﬁxes in the light of the observations made above. For this purpose we direct all the State Governments to ﬁx the rate of such interim wages within six weeks from today and report to this Court of compliance of this direction. (5) We recommend to the State concerned to make law for setting apart a portion of the wages earned by the prisoners to be paid as compensation to deserving victims of the offence the commission of which entailed the sentence of imprisonment to the prisoner, either directly or through a common fund to be created for this purpose or in any other feasible mode.

On the other hand, one needs to bear in mind that the consequences of criminal acts catch up with the accused particularly when the crimes are against the society the ethical concept of forgive and forget merely because the incident took place in the distant past will not hold good in a Court of Law.73. Where there was acquittal in the same year in which the crime was committed but the acquittal was reversed after eight years and conviction and jail terms were awarded and appeal against this order was disposed of in the 20th year of the crime, the Supreme Court reduced the sentence to the period already undergone and imposed a ﬁne which if not paid, the original sentence was to be restored.74. Where the guilt of the accused under sections 406 and 120-B were established beyond all reasonable doubt, the Supreme Court did not interfere with their conviction.

Where the accused convicted and sentenced under sections 379 and 411, were found to be the sole earning member of their families and they had no past criminal records, the Court directed that one year's rigorous imprisonment instead of two would meet the ends of justice.79.

Where the accused, in his late ﬁfties, betraying the conﬁdence of the prosecutrix committed rape on her, it was held that he deserved no sympathy. However, as the accused remained in jail for eight years, the Court took a liberal view and considering his age and helplessness sentenced him to the period for which he had already been in jail.82. Where the victim of rape belonged to a tribal (Bhilla) community and the act of the accused did not cast any serious stigma on the girl and she was married to a different person sometime after the incident by her father, it was held that sentence much below the minimum sentence prescribed could be inﬂicted on the accused.83. Where the conviction and sentence of the accused   husband to rigorous imprisonment for six months under section 498-A was substituted with a ﬁne of Rs. 6,000, taking into consideration the age, occupation and family conditions of the husband, it was held that though the appellate Court was justiﬁed in substituting the jail sentence, the Court ought not have awarded a modest ﬁne.

The purpose of imposition of ﬁne and/or grant of compensation to a great extent must be considered having the relevant factors therefore in mind. It may be compensating the person in one way or the other.90. In the BMW Case, the Supreme Court directed the accused to pay an amount of Rs. 50 lakh to the Union of India which will be utilized within for providing compensation to the victims of motor accidents, where the vehicles owner, driver etc. could not be traced, like victims of hit and run cases.91. Where a doctor was convicted for an attempt to cause miscarriage and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year and pay a ﬁne of Rs. 5,000, the sentence of imprisonment was found to be excessive and was set aside but the ﬁne was enhanced to Rs. 15,000 out of which, if realised Rs. 10,000 was to be paid to the mother of the deceased for the maintenance of the children of the deceased shown to be living with her.92. The accused, an agriculturist, assaulted his sister's husband with a knife giving a blow in his abdomen resulting in death. The accused was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for life under section 302. However, on overall appraisal of material on record and the accused having no criminal antecedents, his conviction under section 302 was set aside and he   was convicted under section 304 and directed to undergo 10 years' R.I.

Out of the ﬁne, if paid, Rs. 10,000 were to be given to the mother of the deceased and Rs. 30,000 utilised for the beneﬁt of the three minor children of the deceased in sum of Rs. 10,000 each.93. Where the accused caused a serious injury in the abdomen of a man and was convicted under section 307 but considering that he had a widowed mother and two children and was willing to compensate the victim substantially, sentence imposed upon him was modiﬁed into one of ﬁne in the way of compensation of Rs. One lakh.94.

It was held that there were no mitigating circumstances. The main cause of his conviction was illicit arrack business and brothel. The fact that for this reason he became the victim of police cruelty was also considered to be not a mitigating circumstance.99. In a double murder case, the accused was awarded death sentence but the execution was postponed. It was held that pain, agony and horror suffered by the prisoner after he was informed about execution was no ground for substituting death sentence.100. Where the accused constructed a water tank which collapsed due to use of low quality material resulting in the death of several persons and the accused was sentenced to the maximum of two years of R.I. provided under section 304A, it   was held that the sentence could not be reduced merely because the matter was more than seven years old and that it would also be a grave injustice to the victims of the crime.101. Where the accused formed an unlawful assembly with the common object of killing three members of a family and one of the accused killed all the three on the spot one after the other in few minutes while others caught hold of the victims, the sentence of life imprisonment awarded to them under sections 302/149 was conﬁrmed but the High Court observed that it was a ﬁt case to award the maximum penalty of death sentence as the accused had acted like a butcher in a slaughter house.102. Where the accused were convicted under section 328 r/w. section 34 for robbing a simple innocent lady of 50 years by administering a stupefying drug through sugarcane juice, the Court refused to take a lenient view and reduce the sentence.103. Where the accused committed a high-handed and broad daylight robbery on a public road, the Court declined to take a lenient view.104. Voluntary intoxication by itself neither absolves the offender of the consequences of his act nor does it makes him liable for lesser offence.105. The mere fact that the accused inﬂicted a single injury resulting in death is not suﬃcient in itself to convert the offence from one under sections 300–304, Part II.106. When the victim has sustained a grievous injury on a vital portion of the body and the injury is life-threatening imposition of sentence of six days only which was the period already undergone by the accused in conﬁnement is too lenient. However, as the parties have forgotten their differences and are living peacefully since 25 years, the Court taking into consideration the aggravating as well as mitigating factors under the facts of this case, imposed a sentence of six months' R.I. and a ﬁne of Rs. 25,000/- against the accused.107."

It is rather strange that the mother-in-law who herself is a woman should resort to killing another woman. Undue sympathy would be harmful to the cause of justice.109.

However, the Courts have framed certain guidelines in the matter of imposition of sentence. The Courts will have to take into account certain principles while exercising their wide discretion in sentencing, such as proportionality, deterrence and rehabilitation. In a proportionality analysis, it is necessary to assess the seriousness of an offence in order to determine the commensurate punishment for the offender.112. Justice demands that Courts should impose punishment beﬁtting the crime so that the Courts reﬂect public abhorrence of the crime.113. Law regulates social interests, arbitrates conﬂicting claims and demand. Undoubtedly, there is a cross-cultural conﬂict where living law must ﬁnd answer to the new challenges and the Courts are required to mould the sentencing system to meet the challenges.114. The principle governing the imposition of punishment will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. However, the sentence should be appropriate, adequate, just, proportionate and commensurate with the nature and gravity of the crime and the manner in which the crime is committed. The gravity of the crime, motive for the crime, nature of the crime and all other attending circumstances have to be borne in mind while imposing the sentence.115. An offence, which affects the morale of the society, should be severely dealt with. Socio-economic status, religion, race, caste or creed of the accused and the victim although may not be wholly irrelevant, should be eschewed in a case of this nature (abduction and rape of minor), particularly when Parliament itself has laid down minimum sentence. One of the principles that the judiciary had all along kept in its mind that rape being a violation with violence of the private person of a woman causes mental scar, thus, not only a physical injury but also a deep sense of some deathless shame is also inﬂicted.116. The Court cannot afford to be casual while imposing the sentence, inasmuch as both the crime and the criminal are equally important in the sentencing process. The Courts must see that the public does not lose conﬁdence in the judicial system. Imposing inadequate sentences will do more harm to the justice system and may lead to a state where the victim loses conﬁdence in the judicial system and resorts to private vengeance.117."

Broadly stated that the PO Act distinguishes offenders below 21 years of age and those above that age, and offenders who are not guilty of having committed an offence punishable with death or that imprisonment for life and those who are guilty of a lesser offence. While in the case of offenders who are above the age of 21 years absolute discretion is given to the Court to release them after admonition or on probation of good conduct, subject to the conditions laid down in the appropriate provisions of the PO Act. In case of offender below the age of 21 years, an injunction is issued to the Court not to sentence them to imprisonment unless it is satisﬁed that, having regard to the circumstances of the case, including the nature of the offence and the character of the offenders, it is not desirable to deal with them under sections 3 and 4 of the PO Act.122.

At the same time, Courts were also to be careful about the impact on the society consequent on letting offenders on probation. Indiscriminate application of provisions of the PO Act to anti-social and white collar offenders may have an adverse effect on the security of the society. Application of the PO Act is speciﬁcally barred in some cases.123. Provisions of the PO Act should be applied having regard to the nature of offence and age, character and antecedents of the offender.124."

COMMENT— The law governing suspension, remission and commutation of sentence is both statutory and constitutional.128. The stage for the exercise of this power generally speaking is post-judicial, i.e., after the judicial process has come to an end. After the judicial function ends, the executive function of giving effect to the judicial verdict commences. Constitutional power under Article 72/161 would override the statutory power contained in sections 432 and 433 and the limitation of section 433A of the Code as well as the power conferred by sections 54 and 55, IPC, 1860.129. No convict has a fundamental right of remission or shortening of sentence. The State in exercise of its executive power of remission must consider each individual case keeping in view the relevant factors. The power of the State to issue general instructions, so that no discrimination is made, is also permissible in law.130. Exercise of executive clemency is a matter of discretion and yet subject to certain standards. It is not a matter of privilege.131. A right to be considered for remission, keeping in view the constitutional safeguards of a convict under Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution of India, must be held to be a legal one. Such a legal right emanates from not only the Prisons Act but also from the Rules framed thereunder.132. The power of remission vested in the Government under section 433A Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr PC, 1973) is not in conﬂict with Articles 72 and 162 of the Constitution.133. Granting of pardon is in no sense an overturning of a judgment of conviction, but rather it is an executive action that mitigates or sets aside the punishment for a crime. It eliminates the effect of conviction without addressing the defendant's guilt or innocence.134. It is open to the President in the exercise of the power vested in him by Article 72 of the Constitution to scrutinize the evidence on the record of the criminal case and come to a different conclusion from that recorded by the Court in regard to the guilt of, and sentence imposed on, the accused.135.",

It was held that delay exceeding two years in the execution of a sentence of death should be considered suﬃcient to entitle the person under sentence of death to invoke Article 21 and demand the quashing of the sentence of death.137. But a three-Judge in Sher Singh v State of Punjab,138. held that though prolonged delay in the execution of a death sentence is   unquestionably an important consideration for determining whether the sentence should be allowed to be commuted, no hard and fast rule that \"delay exceeding two years in the execution of a sentence of death should be considered suﬃcient to entitle the person under sentence of death to invoke Article 21 and demand the quashing of the sentence of death\" can be laid down as has been done in Vatheeswaran Javed Ahmed v State of Maharashtra,139. re-iterated the proposition laid down in Vatheeswaran (supra) case and doubted the competence of the three-Judge Bench to overrule the Vatheeswaran Case. The conﬂicting views are ﬁnally settled by the Constitution Bench in Triveni Ben v State of Gujarat.140. It overruled Vatheeswaran (supra) holding that undue long delay in execution of the sentence of death will entitle the condemned person to approach this Court under Article 32 but the Court will only examine the nature of delay caused and circumstances that ensued after sentence was ﬁnally conﬁrmed by the judicial process and will have no jurisdiction to reopen the conclusions reached by the Court while ﬁnally maintaining the sentence of death. Court, however, may consider the question of inordinate delay in the light of all circumstances of the case to decide whether the execution of sentence should be carried out or should be altered into imprisonment for life. No ﬁxed period of delay could be held to make the sentence of death inexecutable and to this extent the decision in Vatheeswaran case cannot be said to lay down the correct law. In Madhu Mehta v UOI,141.,142. Supreme Court commuted the death sentence on the ground that the mercy petition was pending for eight years after disposal of the criminal appeal by Supreme Court.  [s 54.1.1] Devender Singh Bhullar and Mahendra Das.— In Devender Pal Singh Bhullar v State of NCT of Delhi,143. the convict appealed to the President for clemency in 2003. The President, after a lapse of over eight years, dismissed his mercy plea in 2011. Bhullar had sought commutation of his death penalty to life sentence by the Supreme Court on the ground that there was inordinate delay by the President over his plea for clemency. A two-Judge Bench144. by order dated 12 April 2013 dismissed his plea, by holding that the rule enunciated in Sher Singh's case (supra), Triveniben's case (supra) and some other judgments that long delay may be one of the grounds for commutation of the sentence of death into life imprisonment cannot be invoked in cases where a person is convicted for offence under TADA or similar statutes. Two weeks later in Mahendra Nath Das v UOI,145. the same Bench held that the convict's death sentence could be commuted to life imprisonment because much of the inordinate delay of 12 years in the rejection of his mercy petition by the President was unexplained, and therefore, inexcusable."

But a two-Judge Bench in Sangeet v State of Haryana147. in which it was held that: a reading of some recent decisions delivered by this Court seems to suggest that the remission power of the appropriate Government has effectively been nulliﬁed by awarding sentences of 20 years, 25 years and in some cases without any remission. Is this permissible? Can this Court (or any Court for that matter) restrain the appropriate Government from granting remission of a sentence to a convict? What this Court has done   in Swamy Shraddananda and several other cases, by giving a sentence in a capital offence of 20 years or 30 years imprisonment without remission, is to effectively injunct the appropriate Government from exercising its power of remission for the speciﬁed period. In our opinion, this issue needs further and greater discussion, but as at present advised, we are of the opinion that this is not permissible. The appropriate Government cannot be told that it is prohibited from granting remission of a sentence. Similarly, a convict cannot be told that he cannot apply for a remission in his sentence, whatever the reason. In this case, though the Division Bench raised a doubt about the decision of a three-Judge Bench in Swamy Shraddananda (supra), yet the same has not been referred to a larger Bench.  In Sahib Hussain @ Sahib Jan v State of Rajasthan,148. another two-Judge Bench reiterated the position held in Swamy Shraddananda (supra) by holding that the observations in Sangeet (supra) are not warranted. In Gurvail Singh @ Gala v State of Punjab,149. another two Judge also termed the remarks in Sangeet (supra) were 'unwarranted' and opined that if the two-Judge Bench was of the opinion that earlier judgments, even of a larger Bench were not justiﬁed, the Bench ought to have referred the matter to the larger Bench."

In State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi) v Prem Raj,172. Supreme Court was called upon to consider whether in a case involving conviction under section 7 read with section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988, the High Court could commute the sentence of imprisonment on deposit of a speciﬁed amount by the convict and direct the State Government to pass appropriate order under section 433(c) Cr PC, 1973. It was held that the question of remission lay within the domain of the appropriate government and it was not open to the High Court to give a direction of that kind even if the High Court could give such a direction, it could only direct consideration of the case of premature release by the Government and could not have ordered the premature release of the respondent itself. The right to exercise the power under section 433 Cr PC, 1973 vests in the Government and has to be exercised by the Government in accordance with the rules and established principles.

Wherever the Indian Penal Code or such penal statutes have provided for a minimum sentence for any offence, to that extent, the power of remission or commutation has to be read as restricted; otherwise the whole purpose of punishment will be defeated and it will be a mockery on sentencing.174."

        "section_comments": "The term of imprisonment in default of payment of ﬁne is not a sentence. It is a penalty which a person incurs on account of non-payment of ﬁne. The sentence is something which an offender must undergo unless it is set aside or remitted in part or in whole either in appeal or in revision or in other appropriate judicial proceedings or \"otherwise\". A term of imprisonment ordered in default of payment of ﬁne stands on a different footing. A person is required to undergo imprisonment either because he is unable to pay the amount of ﬁne or refuses to pay such amount. He, therefore, can always avoid to undergo imprisonment in default of payment of ﬁne by paying such amount. It is, therefore, not only the power, but also the duty of the Court to keep in view the nature of offence, circumstances under which it was committed, the position of the offender and other relevant considerations before ordering the offender to suffer imprisonment in default of payment of ﬁne.193. A default sentence is no punishment under law. It is only a method of enforcement of the direction for payment of amounts directed to be paid as ﬁne. Wherever the Criminal Court has the jurisdictional competence to impose a ﬁne, sections 64–70, IPC, and section 30 Cr PC, 1973 stipulate that the Court can recover the same by imposition of a default sentence. The jurisdiction to impose a default sentence is only incidental to the power to impose a ﬁne and the duty of the Court to recover the same.194. The wording of the section is not happy, but the Legislature intended by it to provide for the award of imprisonment in default of payment of ﬁne in all cases in which ﬁne can be imposed to induce the offender to pay the ﬁne. The cases falling under this section are:— Where the offence is punishable with (a) imprisonment with ﬁne, or (b) imprisonment or ﬁne, or (c) ﬁne only, and the offender is sentenced to (i) imprisonment, or (ii) ﬁne, or both, the Court may sentence the offender to a term of imprisonment in default of payment of ﬁne. A term of imprisonment for non-payment of ﬁne is not a substantive sentence. It is only a penalty for the default. It cannot be added to the substantive sentence so as to see whether the maximum imprisonment that could be awarded for the offence is not being exceeded.195. 1. 'Imprisonment as well as ﬁne.'—Magistrates cannot award compensation in addition to ﬁne.196.   The full Bench of Madras High Court held that imprisonment in default of payment of ﬁne cannot be directed to run concurrently with substantive sentence because both the sentences are distinct in view of sections 53 and 64 IPC, 1860.197.",

The position is re-iterated in Sugnathi Suresh Kumar v Jagdeeshan.202.

        "section_comments": "The section says that where an offence is made up of parts, each of which constitutes an offence, the offender should not be punished for more than one offence unless expressly provided. Where an offence falls within two or more separate deﬁnitions of offences; or where several acts of which one or more than one would, by itself or themselves, constitute an offence, constitute, when combined, a different offence, the offender should not be punished with a more severe punishment than the Court which tries him could award for any one of such offences. The section governs the whole Code and regulates the limit of punishment in cases in which the greater offence is made up of two or more minor offences. It is not a rule of adjective law or procedure, but a rule of substantive law regulating the measure of punishment, and it does not, therefore, affect the question of conviction, which relates to the province of procedure. Section 71 IPC, 1860 as well as section 26 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 talk only of punishment and not of conviction. Thus, conviction of the accused in respect of the same act for two different offences is quite legal.226. The section contemplates separate punishments for an offence against the same law and not under different laws. Where offences are committed under two separate enactments, section 71 IPC, 1860 is not helpful to the accused and as such, two separate sentences cannot be   questioned by pressing section 71 into service.227. In order to attract provisions of Article 20(2) of the Constitution, i.e., doctrine of autrefois acquit or section 300 Cr PC, 1973 or section 71 IPC, 1860 or section 26 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 ingredients of the offences in the earlier case as well as in the latter case must be the same and not different. The test to ascertain whether the two offences are the same is not identity of the allegations but the identity of the ingredients of the offence.228. The rules for assessment of punishment are laid down in sections 71 and 72 of the IPC, 1860 and section 31 of the Cr PC, 1973. Section 31 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that when a person is convicted at one trial of two or more offences, the Court may, subject to the provisions of section 71 of the IPC, 1860, sentence him, for such offences, to the several punishments prescribed therefor which such Court is competent to inﬂict; and in the case of consecutive sentences, it shall not be necessary for the Court, by reason only of the aggregate punishment for the several offence being in excess of the punishment which it is competent to inﬂict on conviction of a single offences, to send the offender for trial before a higher Court. It, therefore, enhances the ordinary powers of sentences given to Magistrates by section 29, Cr PC, 1973; but in order to bring a case within the purview of this section, the accused must have been convicted of two or more offences in the same trial, and the sentence for any one of these offences should not exceed the limits of their ordinary powers. The limits ﬁxed by this section refer to sentences passed simultaneously, or upon charges which are tried simultaneously. Sentences of imprisonment passed under it may run concurrently. When an accused is convicted at one trial of two or more offences, section 31(1) of Cr PC, 1973 vests discretion in Court to direct that punishment shall run concurrently. Court may sentence the accused for such offences to several punishments prescribed therefor, and such punishment would consist of imprisonment to commence, one after expiration of other in such order as the Court may direct, subject to limitation contained in section 71 of IPC, 1860.229.",

But he is liable only to one punishment for the whole beating.\" It is to be noted that the whole beating is considered to constitute one offence while each of the blows also amounted to the offence of voluntarily causing hurt. It can be said, therefore, that while the obtaining of money by cheating on the presentation of an individual bill did constitute the offence of cheating the obtaining of the entire money in pursuance of the terms of the single contract and the single conspiracy entered into also constituted the offence of cheating. When the accused could not be punished with the punishment for more than one such offence it cannot be the intention of law that the accused be charged with each of the offences, which were in a way included in the complete offence made up by the entire course of conduct of the accused in pursuance of the conspiracy.230."

The case is not covered either by section 71 of the IPC, 1860 or by section 26 of the General Clauses Act, and the punishment for the two offences cannot be limited under those sections. But, normally, no Court should award two separate punishments for the same act constituting two offences under section 201. The appropriate sentence under section 201 for causing the evidence of the offence under section 330 to disappear should be passed, and no separate sentence need be passed under section 201 for causing the evidence of the offence under section 348 to disappear.236.

COMMENT— Solitary conﬁnement amounts to keeping the prisoner thoroughly isolated from any kind of contact with the outside world. It is inﬂicted in order that a feeling of loneliness may produce wholesome inﬂuence and reform the criminal. This section gives the scale according to which solitary conﬁnement may be inﬂicted. Where the petitioner, an undertrial prisoner, who was arrested in connection with the assassination of a former Prime Minister was put in a separate cell only as a precautionary measure, to ensure his non-mingling with other prisoners and for his security, it was held that it did not amount either to solitary conﬁnement or cellular conﬁnement.245. The well-known principle of law is that the convict carrying death punishment is not deemed to be 'prisoner under sentence of death' unless death sentence becomes ﬁnal, conclusive and beyond judicial scrutiny. Such convict is handed over to the jail authority to be kept in safe and protected custody with purpose that he may be available for execution of the sentence eventually conﬁrmed. This custody is different from custody of a convict suffering from simple or rigorous imprisonment. Therefore, he cannot be kept in Cell or solitary conﬁnement which itself is a separate punishment.246.",

In Batra's case, it has been held that if the prisoner under sentence of death is held in jail custody, punitive detention cannot be imposed upon him by jail authorities except for prison offences. When a prisoner is committed under a warrant for jail custody under section 366(2) Cr PC, 1973 and if he is detained in solitary conﬁnement which is a punishment prescribed by section 73, IPC, 1860 it will amount to imposing punishment for the same offence more than once which would be violative of Article   20(2). Practice of keeping prisoners in condemned cell before conﬁrmation is a preconstitutional practice and such practices should be avoided. Therefore, practice adopted in the jail until now cannot be a ground of putting the petitioners in solitary conﬁnement or separate condemned cells.249. The Supreme Court in Shatrughan Chauhan v UOI250. held that to be 'under sentence of death' means 'to be under a ﬁnally executable death sentence'. The Court, in this case also issued guidelines for safeguarding the rights of the death row convicts."

If the sentence is less than three years or the offence does not fall within any of the two Chapters then section 75, IPC, 1860 would not be applicable.

In the ﬁrst category fall those acts which are within the limits of his jurisdiction. The second category encompasses those acts which may not be within the jurisdiction of the judicial oﬃcer, but are, nevertheless, done or ordered to be done by him, believing in good faith that he had jurisdiction to do them or order them to be done.11.

Explanation.—It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or avoided was of such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the act with the knowledge that it was likely to cause harm. ILLUSTRATIONS (a) A, the captain of a steam vessel, suddenly and without any fault or negligence  on his part, ﬁnds himself in such a position that, before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably run down a boat B, with twenty or thirty passengers on board, unless he changes the course of his vessel, and that, by changing his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C with only two passengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the boat C and in good faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, though he may run down the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of fact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down the boat C. (b) A, in a great ﬁre, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conﬂagration from  spreading. He does this with the intention in good faith of saving human life or property. Here, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so imminent as to excuse A's act. A is not guilty of the offence.",

As in self-defence so in the prevention of harm the accused is faced with two choices both resulting in some harm and of sheer necessity to avoid a greater harm he has to commit an act which would otherwise be an offence. The test really is like this: there must be a situation in which the accused is confronted with a grave danger and he has no choice but to commit the lesser harm may be even to an innocent person, in order to avoid the greater harm.

            "sub_section_name": "Mens rea.—",
            "sub_section_description": "It is a well settled principle of common law that mens rea is an essential ingredient of criminal offence. A statute can exclude that element, but it is a sound rule of construction adopted in England and also accepted in India to construe a statutory provision creating an offence in conformity with the common law rather than against it unless the statute expressly or by necessary implication excludes mens rea. There is a presumption that mens rea is an essential ingredient of a statutory offence; but this may be rebutted by the express words of a statute creating the offence or by necessary implication. But the mere fact that the object of a statute is to promote welfare activities or to eradicate grave social evils is in itself not decisive of the question whether the element of guilty mind is excluded from the ingredients of the offence. It is also necessary to enquire whether a statute by putting a person under strict liability helps him to assist the State in the enforcement of the law; can he do anything to promote the observance of the law? Mens rea by necessary implication can be excluded from a statute only where it is absolutely clear that the implementation of the object of a statute would otherwise be defeated and its exclusion enables those put under strict liability by their act or omission to assist the promotion of the law. The nature of mens rea that will be implied in a statute creating an offence depends upon the object of the Act and the provisions thereof.70. It is, however, held that mens rea is an essential ingredient in every offence except in three cases: (1) cases not criminal in any real sense but which in the public interest are  prohibited under a penalty; (2) public nuisance; and (3) cases criminal in form but which are really only a summary mode of enforcing a  civil right. The maxim actus non facit reum, nisi mens sit rea has, however, no application in its technical sense to the offences under the Penal Code, as the deﬁnitions of various offences contain expressly a proposition as to the state of mind of the accused. In other words, each offence under the Code except offences like waging war (section 121), sedition (section 124A), kidnapping and abduction (sections 359, 363) and counterfeiting coins (section 232) prescribes a mens rea of a speciﬁc kind which is not exactly the same as mens rea in the sense of being a guilty mind under the common law. Thus, throughout the web of the IPC, 1860 the doctrine of mens rea runs as a running thread in the form of \"intentionally\", \"voluntarily\", \"knowingly\", \"fraudulently\", \"dishonestly\" and the like. It is, therefore, not entirely correct to say that the doctrine of mens rea is inapplicable to the offence under the Penal Code. What the Code requires is not negation of mens rea but mens rea of a speciﬁc kind and this may differ from offence-to-offence.   In this section and in sections 87, 88, 89, 91, 92, 93, 95, 100, 104 and 106, 'harm' can only mean physical injury.71.

It was held that upon these facts there was no proof of any such necessity as could justify the prisoners in killing the boy, and that they were guilty of murder.75. A and B, swimming in the sea after shipwreck, get hold of a plank not large enough to support both; A pushes off B, who is drowned. This, in the opinion of Sir James Stephen, is not a crime as A thereby does B no direct bodily harm but leaves him to his chance of getting another plank. According to Archbold this is not a law now. In R v Martin,76. the defendant, charged with driving whilst disqualiﬁed, sought to raise necessity as a defence but on the trial judge ruling, in effect, that necessity was no defence to an 'absolute' offence, he changed his plea to guilty. The circumstances on which the defendant sought to rely were that his wife's son (the defendant's stepson) was late for work and accordingly in danger of losing his job, and that this had made his wife so distraught that she threatened to commit suicide unless he drove her son to work. There was medical evidence available indicating that it was likely that his wife would have attempted suicide had he not driven her son to work. The Court of Appeal, quashing the conviction, held that the trial judge should have left the defence to the   jury. The authorities were now clear, said the Court, and established the following principles. First, the law does recognise a defence of necessity whether arising from wrongful threats of violence to another or from 'objective dangers' (conveniently called duress of circumstances) threatening the defendant or others. Second, the defence is available only if the defendant can be objectively said to be acting reasonably and proportionately to avoid the threat of death or serious injury. Third, it is for the jury to determine whether because of what the defendant reasonably believed he had good cause to fear death or serious injury; and, if so, whether a person of reasonable ﬁrmness, sharing the characteristics of the defendant, would have responded as the defendant did.77."

Thus, where a child of 12 or so used a sharp sword in killing a person along with his two brothers and no evidence either of age or immaturity of understanding was led on his behalf, it was held that he committed an offence at least under section 326, IPC, 1860.81. The Legislature is manifestly referring in this section to an exceptional immaturity of intellect.82. What the section contemplates is that the child should not know the nature and physical consequences of his conduct.83. The circumstances of a case may disclose such a degree of malice as to justify the maxim malitia supplet octatem.84. Where the accused, a boy over 11 years but below 12 years of age, picked up his knife and advanced towards the deceased with a threatening gesture, saying that he would cut him to bits, and did actually cut him, his entire action can only lead to one inference, namely, that he did what he intended to do and that he knew all the time that a blow inﬂicted with a kathi (knife) would effectuate his intention.85. In the prosecution of an 11-year-old child for throwing a brick at a police vehicle and then running away, the Court said that the justices were not entitled to conclude from his appearance that he was normal in respect of incurring criminal responsibility. The test is whether the child knew that what he was doing was seriously wrong and went beyond childish mischief. Running away was not by itself suﬃcient to rebut the presumption of doli incapax. A naughty child would run away from a parent or teacher even if what he had done was not criminal.86.",

The IPC, 1860 provides no protection from culpable liability on ground of tender age to one who is aged 12 years or more. In a child's life the period between seven and 12 years of age is rather the twilight period of transition to a minimal workable level of understanding of things in the ﬁrmament of worldly affairs. And that is why both the IPC, 1860 and the Oaths Act have made special provisions for children below 12 years in respect of matters dependent on a minimal power of understanding.88.

            "sub_section_description": "Section 84 clearly gives statutory recognition to the defence of insanity as developed by the Common Law of England in a decision of the House of Lords rendered in the case of R v Daniel McNaughten.91. In that case, the House of Lords formulated the famous Mc Naughten Rules on the basis of the ﬁve questions, which had been referred to them with regard to the defence of insanity. The reference came to be made in a case where Mc Naughten was charged with the murder by shooting of Edward Drummond, who was the Pvt Secretary of the then Prime Minister of England Sir Robert Peel. The accused Mc Naughten produced medical evidence to prove that, he was not, at the time of committing the act, in a sound state of mind. He claimed that he was suffering from an insane delusion that the Prime Minister was the only reason for all his problems. He had also claimed that as a result of the insane delusion, he mistook Drummond for the Prime Minister and committed his murder by shooting him. The plea of insanity was accepted and Mc Naughten was found not guilty, on the ground of insanity. The aforesaid verdict became the subject of debate in the House of Lords. Therefore, it was determined to take the opinion of all the judges on the law governing such cases. Five questions were subsequently put to the Law Lords. A comparison of answers to question no. 2 and 3 and the provision contained in section 84 of the IPC, 1860 would clearly indicate that the section is modelled on that answers.92. The essential elements of section 84 are as follows: (i) The accused must, at the time of commission of the act be of unsound mind; (ii) The unsoundness must be such as to make the accused at the time when he is  doing the act charged as offence, incapable of knowing the nature of the act or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law.93. Where it is proved that the accused has committed multiple murders while suffering from mental derangement of some sort and it is found that there is (i) absence of any motive, (ii) absence of secrecy, (iii) want of pre-arrangement, and (iv) want of accomplices, it would be reasonable to hold that the circumstances are suﬃcient to support the inference that the accused suffered from unsoundness of mind.94. Though the onus of proving unsoundness of mind is on the accused,95. yet it has been held that where during the investigation previous history of insanity is revealed, it is the duty of an honest investigator to subject the accused to a medical examination and place that evidence before the Court and if this is not done, it creates a serious inﬁrmity in the prosecution case and the beneﬁt of doubt has to be given to the accused.96. Prosecution is duty bound to subject the accused to a medical examination immediately.97. This onus may, however, be discharged by producing evidence as to the conduct of the accused shortly prior to the offence and his conduct at the time or   immediately afterwards, also by evidence of his mental condition, his family history and so forth.98. Every person is presumed to know the natural consequences of his act. Similarly every person is also presumed to know the law. The prosecution has not to establish these facts.99. There are four kinds of persons who may be said to be non compos mentis (not of sound mind): (1) an idiot; (2) one made non compos by illness; (3) a lunatic or a madman; and (4) one who is drunk. An idiot is one who is of non-sane memory from his birth, by a perpetual inﬁrmity, without lucid intervals; and those are said to be idiots who cannot count twenty, or tell the days of the week, or who do not know their fathers or mothers, or the like. A person made non compos men-us by illness is excused in criminal cases from such acts as are-committed while under the inﬂuence of his disorder. A lunatic is one who is aﬄicted by mental disorder only at certain periods and vicissitudes, having intervals of reason. Madness is permanent. Lunacy and madness are spoken of as acquired insanity, and idiocy as natural insanity.100."

Expression \"unsoundness of mind\" has not been deﬁned in the IPC, 1860 and it has mainly been treated as equivalent to insanity. But the term insanity carries different meaning in different contexts and describes varying degrees of mental disorder. Every person who is suffering from mental disease is not ipso facto exempted from criminal liability. The mere fact that the accused is conceited, odd, irascible and his brain is not quite all right, or that the physical and mental ailments from which he suffered had rendered his intellect weak and affected his emotions or indulges in certain unusual acts, or had ﬁts of insanity at short intervals or that he was subject to epileptic ﬁts and there was abnormal behaviour or the behaviour is queer are not suﬃcient to attract the application of section 84 of the IPC, 1860.103. The medical profession would undoubtedly treat the accused as a mentally sick person. However, for the purposes of claiming the beneﬁt of the defence of insanity in law, the appellant would have to prove that his cognitive faculties were so impaired, at the time when the crime was committed, as not to know the nature of the act.104. Only legal insanity is contemplated under section 84 of IPC, 1860.105."

Section 84 lays down the legal test of responsibility in cases of alleged unsoundness of mind. There is no deﬁnition of \"unsoundness of mind\" in the Penal Code. The Courts have, however, mainly treated this expression as equivalent to insanity. But the term \"insanity\" itself has no precise deﬁnition. It is a term used to describe varying degrees of mental disorder. So, every person, who is mentally diseased, is not ipso facto exempted from criminal responsibility. A distinction is to be made between legal insanity and medical insanity. A Court is concerned with legal insanity, and not with medical insanity.107. In this case, the accused was under medical treatment prior to the occurrence. Evidence indicating that he remained mentally ﬁt for about four years after treatment. During the trial also he was sent for treatment and his conduct was normal thereafter. On such facts, it was held, that the accused was not entitled to protection under section 84.

The medical opinion was that he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia which is a form of paranoid psychosis. The plea was allowed. But he being not in a ﬁt state of mind to judge his own welfare or take care of himself without medical aid, the Court directed him to be detained in safe custody under medical supervision and not to be released till medical evidence of social ﬁtness.160.

(2) There is a rebuttable presumption that the appellant was not insane, when he  committed the crime, in the sense laid down by section 84 of the IPC, 1860: the appellant may rebut it by placing before the court all the relevant evidence - oral, documentary or circumstantial, but the burden of proof upon him is no higher than that rests upon a party to civil proceedings. (3) Even if the appellant was not able to establish conclusively that he was insane  at the time he committed the offence, the evidence placed before the court by the appellant or by the prosecution may raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of the court as regards one or more of the ingredients of the offence, including mens rea of the appellant and in that case the court would be entitled to acquit the appellant on the ground that the general burden of proof resting on the prosecution was not discharged\".162. It has been held that merely because an injured witness, who may legitimately be classiﬁed as an interested witness for obvious reasons, may have stated that the appellant was not of unsound mind, cannot absolve the primary duty of the prosecution to establish its case beyond all reasonable doubt explaining why the plea for unsoundness of mind taken by the accused was untenable.163. The burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within the purview of section 84 lies upon the accused under section 105 of the Indian Evidence Act. Under the said section, the Court shall presume the absence of such circumstances.164. But the burden on the accused cannot be equivalent with the burden of proof on the prosecution and cannot be rated higher than the burden on a party to a civil proceeding where a ﬁnding can be based upon preponderance of probabilities. There is no conﬂict between the general burden which is always on the prosecution and which never shifts and the special burden which rests on the accused to make out the defence of insanity.165. Sometimes the facts may in themselves be suﬃcient to discharge the burden which lies on the accused. This possibility was recognised by the Supreme Court in Ratan Lal v State of MP.166. The accused-appellant was kept in police custody for ten days and only then it was felt that he needed medical examination. There was no evidence on record to show what his condition was during those ten days and why he was not examined earlier. This conduct on the part of the police, neither to arrange his examination nor permit him to do so, brought about such a gap of time between the incident and examination that his condition at the time of the incident was no longer capable of being precisely determined. As against this police inaction, the defence pointed towards the conduct of the accused before the incident and some statements of witnesses which supported the instable condition of the accused. This was held to be suﬃcient to discharge the burden which lies on the accused and his acquittal was upheld by the Supreme Court. Going by this case in Tukappa Tamanna Lingardi v State of Maharashtra,167. the Bombay High Court found evidence of insanity from a narration of the facts themselves. Mere oral statements of witnesses cannot give rise to an inference that the appellant was of unsound mind at the time of commission of offence. Plea of the accused does not come within exception contemplated under section 84 of IPC, 1860.168. IPC, 1860 Where there was no satisfactory evidence of the previous history of the accused or his subsequent conduct and the only fact on record was that ghastly murders were committed without motive, it was held that the burden of proof as to plea of insanity was not discharged. However, because of the absence of motive, premeditation and any weapon, killings being done with stone pieces, death sentence was converted into life imprisonment.169. Where, on the other hand, a father killed his son and then danced   around, moving towards his house threatening others, facts spoke for themselves so as to discharge the burden of proof as to insanity, the accused was acquitted and ordered to be detained in a mental home.170. Mere eccentric behaviour, like drowning one's own two and a half-year-old child to death, does not discharge this burden which is essentially on the accused and requires him to show all the ingredients of the defence to the extent at least of making them probable at the time of the commission of the act. Previous history and subsequent conduct are only relevant facts in the determination of the condition at the material time.171. The mere absence of motive is not suﬃcient to bring the case within the scope of section 84.172."

The deceased became violent towards her two or three times each week. She sought psychiatric help and on two occasions came to the attention of the police.

In the light of the evidence, the Court reached the conclusion that there were in the present case those exceptional circumstances which would allow the Court to take the unusual course of passing a sentence other than custody. The accused woman had been subject from a young age to persistent and prolonged violence from a man older than herself who was domineering and demanding. Since her arrest she had made remarkable progress, and a custodial sentence would be likely to damage and possibly bring to an end that rehabilitation. She had served the equivalent of a sentence of 12 months and it was appropriate to give her the opportunity to continue her progress. The Court accordingly quashed the sentence of four years' detention in a young offender institution and substituted a probation order.174."

Mere taking treatment earlier in Mental Hospital itself is not suﬃcient proof of total insanity of person.177. The accused killed his wife and daughter with an axe. He attended Kirtan (rendering of religious hymns) a night before. He carried the corpses in a hand-cart and made his statement before the police. His confessional statement was recorded by a competent judicial magistrate. He found no noticeable abnormality of mind or mental disorderliness.

            "sub_section_description": "Nevertheless voluntary drunkenness is a factor which has to be taken into consideration at least in two types of cases, viz., (i) where a speciﬁc intent is an essential element of an offence charged and the evidence shows that the state of intoxication of the accused is such that he is incapable of forming the speciﬁc intent essential to constitute the crime.191. In the Indian context, for example, it would be intent to kill as in clauses 1, 2, and 3 of section 300, IPC, 1860. In such cases, however, even if the accused fails to actually form the speciﬁc intent, section 86, IPC, 1860, would impute the necessary guilty knowledge to him and he would, therefore, be liable for culpable homicide not amounting to murder though not of murder.192. Thus, voluntary intoxication amounting to prove incapacity to form the required speciﬁc intent would be a limited excuse to reduce an offence of murder (section 302) to one of culpable homicide not amounting murder (section 304, IPC, 1860). This is, however, a question of fact in each case. In a case of wife-burning, her dying declaration disclosed that her husband consumed liquor, scolded her and then set her aﬁre after pouring kerosene on her. She fought the ﬁre and tried to run away but the accused again caught hold of her and again poured oil and inﬂamed her. It was held that these circumstances showed that the mental faculties of the accused were not impaired to such an extent that he was prevented from forming the requisite intention to cause death. He was convicted under section 302 and not section 304, Part II.193. (ii) where habitual drunkenness has resulted in such a diseased condition of the mind that the accused is incapable of knowing the nature of the act or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law. In such a case M'Naughten Rules (section 84, IPC,   1860) would come into play and he would be absolved from liability.194. The most common example of such an alcoholic disease is \"Delirium Tremens\" which is produced by prolonged and habitual excessive drinking and results in loss of the faculty of reasoning or serious defect of reasoning. In other words, \"insanity, whether produced by drunkenness or otherwise, is a defence to the crime charged.\"195. Under this section if a man is made drunk through stratagem or the fraud of others, or through ignorance, or through any other means causing intoxication without the man's knowledge or against his will, he is excused.196."

It was held that drunkenness was no defence unless it could be established that the accused at the time of committing rape was so drunk that he was incapable of forming the intent to commit it (which was not alleged), inasmuch as the death resulted from a succession of acts, the rape and the act of violence causing suffocation, which could not be regarded independently of each other; and that the accused was guilty of murder.197. Drink is an aggravating feature in the award of sentence. In reference to one of the accused persons there was no evidence to establish that the effect of intoxication was such as to cause him to lack the speciﬁc intent for murder, particularly in view of the fact that, on his own admission, he was following instructions given by the other accused and he was able to give the police a lucid account of his actions. The degree of intoxication fell far below that which would preclude the formation of speciﬁc intent required for murder.198."

        "section_description": "In cases where an act done is not an offence unless done with a particular knowledge or intent, a person who does the act in a state of intoxication shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had the same knowledge as he would have had if he had not been   intoxicated, unless the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or against his will.",
        "section_comments": "Offence requiring particular intent or knowledge.—By reading the above section, it is clear that in the ﬁrst part of the section the words 'intention or knowledge' are mentioned, but in the latter part of the section the word 'knowledge' is only mentioned and the word 'intention' is omitted. In case of voluntary drunkenness, knowledge is to be presumed in the same manner as if there was no drunkenness. If really the Parliament wanted the word 'intention' also to be presumed even in the case of an act done in a drunken state of mind, the said word could have been mentioned in the Second part also, but the same is omitted. Therefore, whether the accused was having intention or not while committing an act cannot be presumed as in case of knowledge.199. As certain guilty knowledge or intention forms part of the deﬁnition of many offences, this section is provided to meet those cases. It says that a person voluntarily intoxicated will be deemed to have the same knowledge as he would have had if he had not been intoxicated. There may be cases in which a particular knowledge is an ingredient, and there may be other cases in which a particular intent is an ingredient, the two not being necessarily always identical. The section does not say that the accused shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had the same intention as might have been presumed if he had not been intoxicated. Therefore, although there is a presumption so far as knowledge is concerned, there is no such presumption with regard to intention.200. Thus, this section attributes to a drunken man the knowledge of a sober man when judging of his action but does not give him the same intention. This knowledge is the result of a legal ﬁction and constructive intention cannot invariably be raised.201. Drunkenness makes no difference to the knowledge with which a man is credited and if a man knew what the natural consequences of his acts were, he must be presumed to have intended to cause them.202. But this presumption may be rebutted by his showing that at the time he did the act, his mind was so affected by the drink he had taken that he was incapable of forming the intention requisite for making his act the offence charged against him.203. So far as knowledge is concerned the Court must attribute to the intoxicated man the same knowledge as if he was quite sober but so far as intent or intention is concerned, the Court must gather it from the attending general circumstances of the case paying due regard to the degree of intoxication. If the man was beside his mind altogether for the time being, it would not be possible to ﬁx him with the requisite intention. In other words, where a man goes so deep into drinking that he becomes really incapable of forming the requisite speciﬁc intent or knowledge for the offence, then in such a case too section 86 of the Code would impute the requisite knowledge to the accused though not the requisite intention. Thus, where the accused in a state of extreme intoxication caused a fatal injury in the abdomen of his friend but by virtue of his highly intoxicated state of mind was incapable of knowing then as to what he was doing far less forming the requisite intent to kill as envisaged in section 300, IPC, 1860, he could not be convicted under section 302 as he did not have the requisite intent to kill but he could still be convicted under section 304 Part II, IPC, 1860, by virtue of imputed knowledge under section 86, IPC, 1860.204. In this connection see also the discussion under sub-head \"voluntary drunkenness: when an excuse\" under section 85, ante. But if he had not gone so deep in drinking and from the facts it could be found that he knew what he was about the Court will apply the rule that a man is presumed to intend the natural consequences of his act or acts.205.",

He did set his wife on ﬁre, but as soon as her sari started burning he realised the folly of his act and started extinguishing the ﬁre.

These provisions show that if the intoxication is induced voluntarily, the act done is an offence even if the person is incapable of knowing the nature of the act or that what he is doing is either wrong or contrary to law. This section obviously covers all offences. That is why; it appears that it became necessary to enact section 86 to take care of offences requiring a particular intent or knowledge on the part of the intoxicated offender. The section takes care of such offences and states that if intoxication is involuntary, neither knowledge nor intention in committing the offence will be presumed. If however, it is voluntary only knowledge of the offence on the part of the offender will be presumed but not intention in committing it. What section 86 means and no more as compared to section 85. The degree of intoxication demanded by both sections, however, remains the same. In fact, it is instructive to note that section 84 which exempts persons of unsoundness of mind also expects the degree of unsoundness to the same extent, viz., incapability of knowing the nature of the act or of the knowledge that what is being done either wrong or contrary to law. Hence, the conclusion is inescapable that to avail of the exception under section 86, the degree of intoxication of the offender must be such that he is incapable of knowing the nature of the act or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law. Intoxication short of this degree will not entitle the offender to the beneﬁt of the exception.209."

It is an archaic notion that to maintain discipline, child can be punished physically by the teaching staff because of implied consent by the parents or guardian. Now it is recognized social principle that even parents of the child are made to understand the basic human rights of the child and instead of corporal punishment, correctional methods are recognized in law.218. But the applicability of sections 88 and 89, IPC, 1860 and administering of corporal punishments on students by the teachers for their beneﬁt, came up for consideration in M Natesan v State of Madras.219. It was a case where a boy of 15 years was sent with the progress report to get the signature of his parents in it. But he returned it with a thumb impression of another person, stating that the said thumb impression was that of his mother, which was proved to be wrong. The teacher got agitated and he beat the boy on his right palm with a stick. He did not cry. He, therefore, beat him again, asking him why he did not cry. This resulted in causing three injuries, two superﬁcial and one contusion. The Madras High Court held that:   It cannot be denied that having regard to the peculiar position of a school teacher he must in the nature of things have authority to enforce discipline and correct a pupil put in his charge. To deny that authority would amount to a denial of all that is desirable and necessary for the welfare, discipline and education of the pupil concerned. It can therefore be assumed that when a parent entrusted a child to a teacher, he on his behalf impliedly consents for the teacher to exercise over the pupil such authority. Of course, the person of the pupil is certainly protected by the penal provisions of the Indian Penal Code. But the same code has recognised exceptions in the form of ss. 88 and 89. Where a teacher exceeds the authority and inﬂicts such harm to the pupil as may be considered to be unreasonable and immoderate, he would naturally lose the beneﬁt of the exceptions. Whether he is entitled to the beneﬁt of the exceptions or not in a given case will depend upon the particular nature, extent and severity of the punishment inﬂicted.  220.In K A Abdul Vahid v State of Kerala,221. the Kerala High Court considered the  question when a school teacher, beats a student with a cane, who created commotion in the school or showed disobedience to the Rules, whether he could be proceeded against under the provisions of the IPC, 1860 and found that the teacher has acted within the exception conferred on him, under section 88 of IPC, 1860."

This section says that consent is not a true consent if it is given— (1) by a person under fear of injury;  and the person obtaining the consent knows or has reason to believe this.  (2) by a person under a misconception of fact; (3) by a person of unsound mind;  and who is unable to understand the nature  (4) by a person who is intoxicated;  and consequence of that to which he gives his consent.  (5) by a person under 12 years of age  Consent is an act of reason, accompanied with deliberation, the mind weighing as in balance, the good and evil on each side.222. Consent means an active will in the mind of a person to permit the doing of the act complained of, and knowledge of what is to be done, or of the nature of the act that is being done, is essential to consent to an act.223. An act of helplessness on the face of inevitable compulsions is not consent in law.224. It requires voluntary participation by victim not only after exercise of intelligence based on knowledge of signiﬁcance and moral quality of act, but after having fully exercised the choice between resistance and assent.225. A mere act of helpless resignation in the face of inevitable compulsion, non-resistance and passive giving in cannot be deemed to be consent.226. The Supreme Court in a long line of cases has given wider meaning to the word 'consent' in the context of sexual offences as explained in various judicial dictionaries. In Jowitt's Dictionary of English Law (Second Edn), vol (1) 1977 at p 422 the word 'consent' has been explained as an act of reason accompanied with deliberation, the mind weighing, as in a balance, the good or evil on either side. It is further stated that consent supposes three things–a physical power, a mental power, and a free and serious use of them and if consent be obtained by intimidation, force, meditated imposition, circumvention, surprise, or undue inﬂuence, it is to be treated as a delusion, and not as a deliberate and free act of the mind.227. Section 90 cannot be considered as an exhaustive deﬁnition of consent for the purposes of IPC, 1860. The normal connotation and concept of consent is not intended to be excluded.228. For determining whether consent given by the prosecutrix was voluntary or under a misconception of fact, no straitjacket formula can be laid down.229.   The factors set out in the ﬁrst part are from the point of view of the victim. The second part enacts the corresponding provision from the point of view of the accused. It envisages that the accused too has the knowledge or reason to believe that the consent was given by the victim in consequence of fear of injury or misconception of fact. The requirements of both the parts have to be cumulatively satisﬁed.230. Submission of the body under the fear of terror cannot be construed as a consented sexual act. Consent for the purpose of section 375 requires voluntary participation not only after the exercise of intelligence based on the knowledge of the signiﬁcance and moral quality of the act but after having fully exercised the choice between resistance and assent. Whether there was consent or not, is to be ascertained only on a careful study of all relevant circumstances.231. Consent can be obtained under various methods and always necessarily need not be a one which is given voluntarily. For example, if a victim is intoxicated without her knowledge or consent and if the rape is committed while the victim was intoxicated or drunken, it cannot be said that she had voluntarily given the consent. Therefore, such passive consent cannot be treated as a consent as contemplated by section 90 of IPC, 1860.232. Obtaining consent by exercising deceit cannot be legitimate defence to exculpate an accused.233.",

Every consent involves a submission, but every submission is not consent and the mere fact that a woman had submitted to the promise of the accused does not necessarily indicate that her consent existed unless the evidence on record establishes that the sexual act, which the prosecutrix had allowed, was accompanied with deliberation after the mind had weighed, as in a balance, the good and the evil on each side with the existing capacity and power to withdraw the assent according to one's will or pleasure.235. Where, the accused had sexual intercourse with the prosecutrix by giving false assurance to her that he would marry her and when she became pregnant, he refused to do so, it was evident that he never intended to marry her and procured her consent only for the reason of having sexual relations with her, therefore, the act of the accused fell squarely under the deﬁnition of rape as her consent was obtained under a misconception of fact.236."

            "sub_section_description": "The prosecutrix had sexual intercourse with the accused on the representation made by the accused that he would marry her. This was a false promise held out by the accused. Had this promise not been given perhaps, she would not have permitted the accused to have sexual intercourse. It appears that the intention of the accused was, right from the beginning, not honest and he kept on promising that he will marry her, till she became pregnant. This kind of consent obtained by the accused cannot be said to be any consent because she was under a misconception of fact that the accused intends to marry her, therefore, she had submitted to sexual intercourse with him.241. In Uday v State of Karnataka,242. the Court considered the following facts: (i) where a girl was of 19 years of age and had suﬃcient intelligence to understand the signiﬁcance and moral quality of the act she was consenting to; (ii) she was conscious of the fact that her marriage was diﬃcult on account of caste considerations; (iii) it was diﬃcult to impute to the appellant, knowledge that the prosecutrix had consented in consequence of a misconception of the fact arising from his promise; and (iv) there was no evidence to prove conclusively that the appellant never intended to marry the prosecutrix. On the basis of the above factors, Court held that it did not feel persuaded to hold that consent was obtained by misconception of facts on the part of the victim. In a case, the prosecutrix had left her home voluntarily, of her own free will to get married to the accused. She was 19 years of age at the relevant time and was, hence, capable of understanding the complications and issues surrounding her marriage to the appellant. According to the version of events provided by her, the prosecutrix had called the accused on a number given to her by him, to ask him why he had not met her at the place that had been pre-decided by them. She also waited for him for a long time,   and when he ﬁnally arrived she went with him to the Karna Lake where they indulged in sexual intercourse. She did not raise any objection at this stage and made no complaints to anyone. Thereafter, she also went to Kurukshetra with the accused, where she lived with his relatives. Here to, the prosecutrix voluntarily became intimate with the accused. She then, for some reason, went to live in the hostel at Kurukshetra University illegally, and once again came into contact with the accused at the Birla Mandir. Thereafter, she even proceeded with the accused to the old bus-stand in Kurukshetra, to leave for Ambala so that the two of them could get married. However, they were apprehended by the police. If the prosecutrix was in fact going to Ambala to marry the accused, as stands fully established from the evidence on record, the Supreme Court held it fails to understand on what basis the allegation of \"false promise of marriage\" has been raised by the prosecutrix.243."

The principal object of sections 88, 89 and 92 is protection of medical practitioners. Illustrations (a) and (b) exemplify cases in which it is impossible to give consent; illustrations (c) and (d), where legal capacity to consent is wanting. The author of the Code observes:   There yet remains a kindred class of cases which are by no means of rare occurrence. For example, a person falls down in an apoplectic ﬁt. Bleeding alone can save him, and he is unable to signify his consent to be bled. The surgeon who bleeds him commits an act falling under the deﬁnition of an offence. The surgeon is not the patient's guardian, and has no authority from any such guardian, yet it is evident that the surgeon ought not to be punished. Again, a house is on ﬁre. A person snatches up a child too young to understand the danger, and ﬂings it from the house-top, with a faint hope that it may be caught on a blanket below, but with the knowledge that it is highly probable that it will be dashed to pieces. Here, though the child may be killed by the fall though the person who threw it down knew that it would very probably be killed, and though he was not the child's parent or guardian, he ought not to be punished. In these examples there is what may be called a temporary guardianship justiﬁed by the exigency of the case and by the humanity of the motive. This temporary guardianship bears a considerable analogy to that temporary magistracy with which the law invests every person who is present when a great crime is committed, or when the public peace is concerned. To acts done in the exercise of this temporary guardianship, we extend by clause 72 a protection very similar to that which we have given to the acts of regular guardians.244.

As our deﬁnitions are framed, it is theft to dip a pen in another man's ink, mischief to crumble one of his wafers, an assault to cover him with a cloud of dust by riding past him, hurt to incommode him by pressing against him in getting into a carriage. There are innumerable acts without performing which men cannot live together in society, acts which all men constantly do and suffer in turn, and which it is desirable that they should do and suffer in turn, yet which differ only in degree from crimes. That these acts ought not to be treated as crimes is evident, and we think it far better expressly to except them from the penal clauses of the Code than to leave it to the judges to except them in practice.253.  The expression 'harm' has been used in this section in a wide sense including physical injury and hence, this section applies in cases of actual physical injury also.

When enacting sections 96 to 106 of the IPC, 1860, excepting from its penal provisions, certain classes of acts, done in good faith for the purpose of repelling unlawful aggressions, the Legislature clearly intended to arouse and encourage the manly spirit of self-defence amongst the citizens, when faced with grave danger.269.",

The right of private defence is available only to one who is suddenly confronted with the necessity of averting an impending danger not of self-creation. That being so, the necessary corollary is that the violence which the citizen defending himself or his property is entitled to use must not be unduly disproportionate to the injury which is sought to be averted or which is reasonably apprehended and should not exceed its legitimate purpose. The law does not require a law abiding citizen to behave like a coward when confronted with an imminent unlawful aggression. There is nothing more degrading to the human spirit than to run away in face of danger. The right of private defence is thus, designed to serve a social purpose and deserves to be fostered within the prescribed limits. The IPC, 1860 deﬁnes homicide in self-defence as a form of substantive right, and therefore, save and except the restrictions imposed on the right of the Code itself, it seems that the special rule of English Law as to the duty of retreating will have no application to this country where there is a real need for defending oneself against deadly assaults. The right to protect one's own person and property against the unlawful aggressions of others is a right inherent in man. The duty of protecting the person and property of others is a duty which man owes to society of which he is a member and the preservation of which is both his interest and duty. It is, indeed, a duty which ﬂows from human sympathy. As Bentham said: It is a noble movement of the heart, that indignation which kindles at the sight of the feeble injured by the strong. It is noble movement which makes us forget our danger at the ﬁrst cry of distress..... It concerns the public safety that every honest man should consider himself as the natural protector of every other.  But such protection must not be extended beyond the necessities of the case; otherwise it will encourage a spirit or lawlessness and disorder. The right has, therefore, been restricted to offences against the human body and those relating to aggression on property. Right of private defence of person and property is recognized in all free, civilised, democratic societies within certain reasonable limits. Those limits are dictated by two considerations: (1) that the same right is claimed by all other members of the society and (2) that it is the State which generally undertakes the responsibility for the maintenance of law and order. The citizens, as a general rule, are neither expected to run away for safety when faced with grave and imminent danger to their person or property as a result of unlawful aggression, nor are they expected, by   use of force, to right the wrong done to them or to punish the wrong doer of commission of offences.271."

No test in the abstract for determining such a question can be laid down. In determining this question of fact, the Court must consider all the surrounding circumstances. It is not necessary for the accused to plead in so many words that he acted in self-defence. If the circumstances show that the right of private defence was legitimately exercised, it is open to the Court to consider such a plea.275. The means and the force a threatened person adopts at the spur of the moment to ward off the danger and to save himself or his property cannot be weighed in golden scales. It is neither possible nor prudent to lay down abstract parameters which can be applied to determine as to whether the means and force adopted by the threatened person was proper or not. Answer to such a question depends upon host of factors like the prevailing circumstances at the spot; his feelings at the relevant time; the confusion and the excitement depending on the nature of assault on him etc. Nonetheless, the exercise of the right of private defence can never be vindictive or malicious. It would be repugnant to the very concept of private defence.276. A person who is apprehending death or bodily injury cannot weigh in golden scales in the spur of moment and in the heat of circumstances, the number of injuries required to disarm the assailants who were armed with weapons. In moments of excitement and disturbed mental equilibrium it is often diﬃcult to expect the parties to preserve composure and use exactly only so much force in retaliation commensurate with the danger apprehended to him where assault is imminent by use of force, it would be lawful to repel the force in self-defence and the right of private defence commences, as soon as the threat becomes so imminent. Such situations have to be pragmatically viewed and not with high powered spectacles or microscopes to detect slight or even marginal overstepping. Due weightage has to be given to, and hyper technical approach has to be avoided in considering what happens on the spur of the moment on the spot and keeping in view normal human reaction and conduct, where self-preservation is the paramount consideration. But, if the fact situation shows that in the guise of self-preservation, what really has been done is to assault the original aggressor, even after the cause of reasonable apprehension has disappeared, the plea of right of private defence can legitimately be negatived. The Court dealing with the plea has to weigh the material to conclude whether the plea is acceptable. It is   essentially, as noted above, a ﬁnding of fact.277. Situations have to be judged from the subjective point of view of the accused concerned in the surrounding excitement and confusion of the moment, confronted with a situation of peril and not by any microscopic and pedantic scrutiny. In adjudging the question as to whether more force than was necessary was used in the prevailing circumstances on the spot it would be inappropriate, as held by this Court, to adopt tests by detached objectivity which would be so natural in a Court room, or that which would seem absolutely necessary to a perfectly cool bystander. The person facing a reasonable apprehension of threat to himself cannot be expected to modulate his defence step-by-step with any arithmetical exactitude of only that much which is required in the thinking of a man in ordinary times or under normal circumstances.278. Mere use of abusive language does not give rise to private defence. Thus, where the deceased about a month before the murder had tried to outrage the modesty of the wife of the accused and thereafter on the day of the incident cut a rustic joke enquiring whether the accused had not kept buffaloes for drinking milk which lead the accused to beat the deceased mercilessly resulting in his death, it was held that giving the most charitable interpretation one could not ﬁnd a single circumstance which will give the accused the beneﬁt of the right of private defence and the interval between the attempt to outrage the modesty of the accused's wife and the murder being too long he was also not entitled to get the beneﬁt of grave and sudden provocation within the meaning of exception 1 to section 300, IPC, 1860.279. Giving a general view of all the provisions on this right in Munney Khan v State,280. the Supreme Court observed: The right of private defence is codiﬁed in sections 96 to 106, IPC, which have all to be read together in order to have a proper grasp of the scope and limitations of this right. By enacting the sections the authors of the Code wanted to except from the operation of its penal clauses acts done in good faith for the purpose of repelling unlawful aggression.281. Summary of Principles regarding Private defence (i) Self-preservation is the basic human instinct and is duly recognized by the  criminal jurisprudence of all civilized countries. All free, democratic and civilized countries recognize the right of private defence within certain reasonable limits. (ii) The right of private defence is available only to one who is suddenly confronted  with the necessity of averting an impending danger and not of self-creation. (iii) A mere reasonable apprehension is enough to put the right of self-defence into  operation. In other words, it is not necessary that there should be an actual commission of the offence in order to give rise to the right of private defence. It is enough if the accused apprehended that such an offence is contemplated and it is likely to be committed if the right of private defence is not exercised. (iv) The right of private defence commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension  arises and it is co-terminus with the duration of such apprehension. (v) It is unrealistic to expect a person under assault to modulate his defence step by  step with any arithmetical exactitude. (vi) In private defence the force used by the accused ought not to be wholly  disproportionate or much greater than necessary for protection of the person or property. (vii) It is well settled that even if the accused does not plead self-defence, it is open  to consider such a plea if the same arises from the material on record. (viii) The accused need not prove the existence of the right of private defence   beyond reasonable doubt. (ix) The IPC, 1860 confers the right of private defence only when that unlawful or  wrongful act is an offence. (x) A person who is in imminent and reasonable danger of losing his life or limb  may in exercise of self-defence inﬂict any harm even extending to death on his assailant either when the assault is attempted or directly threatened. [Darshan Singh v State of Punjab.282.] All the sections would have to be read together to ascertain whether in the facts and circumstances of the case the accused were entitled to the defence or they exceeded it. Only then one can get a comprehensive view of the scope and limitations of the right.283."

Where the accused were in fact the aggressors and being members of the aggressors party none of the accused can claim right of self-defence.295. Merely because there was a quarrel and some of the accused person sustained injuries, that does not confer a right of private defence extending to the extent of causing death. It has to be established that the accused person were under such grave apprehension about the safety of their life and property that retaliation to the extent done was absolutely necessary. Right of private defence has been rightly discarded.296.

Where the right of private defence was not pleaded by the accused, but it appeared that the complainant was the aggressor, the Bombay High Court held that the beneﬁt of such defence could still be given to the accused.331. Fact that accused pleaded alibi-itself will not preclude the Court from giving him also the right of private defence if on proper appraisal of evidence and other material on records, Court ﬁnds it to be available to him.332. The right of private defence cannot be denied merely because the accused adopted a different line of defence particularly when the evidence adduced by the prosecution would indicate that they were put under a situation where they could reasonably have apprehended grievous hurt even to one of them.333. The Supreme Court endorsed this principle by saying that it is not necessary that the plea of private defence must always be taken by the accused person. Even if the accused does not do so, the Court can consider it if the circumstances show that the right of private defence was legitimately exercised.334.

The second provides for the defence of property against an act which amounts to the commission of certain offences. There is no obligation upon a person entitled to exercise the right of private defence and to defend his person or property, to retire merely because his assailant threatens him with violence.337. Explaining the genesis of the rule, the Supreme Court has observed:338. \"It is important to bear in mind that self-preservation of one's life is the necessary concomitant of the right of life enshrined in Art. 21 of the Constitution of India, fundamental in nature, sacred, precious and inviolable. The importance and validity of the duty and right to self-preservation has a species in the right of self-defence in criminal law.

The right of private defence does not arise where the accused were the aggressors and the question of exceeding such right also does not arise.340. The Supreme Court added, in this case, that the right of self-defence arises when there is unexpected apprehension and one is taken unawares, or the accused happens to kill accidentally while using reasonable force private defence can be used to ward off unlawful force, or to prevent it, to avoid unlawful detention and to escape from such detention.341. When the father of the accused was trying to forcibly remove the gate of the thrashing ground of the deceased which was situated on the land of the deceased, his act amounted to an offence of 'mischief'. And, if the deceased while protecting his own property assaulted the father of the accused with a lathi, and the accused killed him in return, the accused could not claim the right of private defence of body of his father.342. In another case of the same kind the father of the accused was trying to pull out the gate of the deceased thrashing mill and on the deceased assaulting him in protection, the accused struck him dead. The right of private defence was not available in the circumstances.343. Where the parties went away from the property over which they were ﬁghting, the death caused at that shifted place was not a justiﬁable exercise of the right of private defence.344. Where the accused succeeded in establishing their right to the property in dispute through the Court and then went to the ﬁeld with a view   to ask the other party to vacate the premises, it was held that it by itself did not render them to be aggressors for the purpose of denying them the beneﬁt of right of selfdefence.345. Number of injuries is not always the safe criterion for determining who the aggressor is. The fact of injuries on the body of the accused does not by itself create the presumption that the accused was entitled to the right of private defence.346."

But if no plea was entered on behalf of the accused and there were also no circumstances to show that the accused had probably the right of private defence, such a right could not be presumed on behalf of the accused on mere conjectures and surmises.349. A mere bald assertion without any evidence of facts and circumstances does not make out a case of private defence.350. The accused can, however, make out his plea by mere preponderance of probabilities from materials already on record and need not prove it to the hilt.351. Where by preponderance of probabilities the plea of private defence of the accused is plausible, beneﬁt should be extended to the accused.352. Failure on the part of the prosecution to prove that the injuries on the person of the accused were not caused in self-defence, makes the defence of the accused probable and he is entitled to its beneﬁt because he has not to prove his defence beyond reasonable doubt.353. Where the accused set up the plea of selfdefence only during trial and not during investigation, it was held that this was not a ground for rejecting the plea.354. The accused on the observation of the High Court that the deceased was stabbed by the appellant, not in pursuance of any pre-planned attack, but being under the impression that the deceased was coming to attack him. The said observation cannot be read out of context to make out a case that the accused acted in self-defence. Such a plea is neither put forth in the statement under section 313 nor brought out in the cross examination of any of the prosecution witnesses.355. It is true that the right of private defence need not speciﬁcally be taken and in the event the Court on the basis of the materials on record is in a position to come to such a conclusion, despite some other plea having been raised, that such a case had been made out, it may act thereupon.356."

It was held that if the son had reasonable ground for believing and honestly believed that his act was necessary for the defence of his mother, the homicide was excusable.357. Where a girl was being sexually molested and her father hit the assailant resulting in consequential death, it was held that the father was entitled to the right of private defence irrespective of the fact whether the affair was with or without consent because of the girl being a minor.358. Where a man found his wife in compromising position with a person who sprang at the husband and caused him multiple injuries, some of them grievous, the husband thereafter gave a chopper blow resulting in the death of that person, it was held that the husband had not exceeded his right of private defence and was entitled to acquittal.359. Where the father of the accused was being given lathi blows by the complainant party, the accused ﬁred from the licensed gun of his father to defend his father, it was held that he had acted in the exercise of the right of private defence whether the injuries caused to his father were simple or grievous.360. Trespassers on the property of another cannot get any beneﬁt of right of private defence if they are attacked by the person in possession of the property.361. However no one including the true owner has a right to dispossess the trespasser by force if the trespasser is in settled possession of the land and in such a case unless he is evicted in due course of law, he is entitled to defend his possession even against the rightful owner. Such possession of the trespasser must extend over a suﬃciently long period and acquiesced in by the true owner.362. Though law permits even a trespasser in settled possession to defend his possession but, it does not permit a person to take the law in his own hand to take forcible possession merely because he has obtained a favourable order under section 145 Cr PC, 1973. Such a person cannot claim private defence.363. Settled possession means such clear and effective physical possession that under the criminal law he, even if he is a trespasser, gets the right to defend his possession of the property against an attack even by the true owner.364. If no party is proved to be in settled possession, the question of exercise of right of private defence does not arise.365. Where the accused were in possession of the property and had grown the paddy, they were entitled to defend their possession by using reasonable force which in the instant case went up to causing of death as the party in possession was attacked and grievous blows were given to them.366. Where the prosecution party attacked the accused, his brothers and others with sharp edged weapons and lathis and when they tried to enter the latter's house, the accused ﬁred at the crowd resulting in the death of a man and injuries to others, it was held that the accused had acted only in the exercise of the right of private defence and he was entitled to complete acquittal.367. Where the accused was ﬁred at to dispel his party from attempting to rescue their friend from illegal police detention and an informer accompanying the police who tried to prevent them from snatching the police gun received fatal injuries, it was held that they were entitled to the right of private defence.368. Where a fatal injury was caused in consequence of hot exchange of words, the right of private defence was held to be not available.369. The Supreme Court has suggested that the number and nature of injuries sustained by the accused and the deceased in any case, may furnish good evidence to consider whether the accused was acting in private defence and, if so, whether he had exceeded his right. In the state of the evidence on record in that case and the number of injuries suffered by the accused, the Court did not accede to the contention that the right was not properly exercised.370."

Therefore, the right of private defence of property will not extend to the causing of death of the person who committed such acts, if the act of trespass is in respect of an open land. Only a house-trespass committed under such circumstances as may reasonably cause apprehension that death or grievous hurt would be the consequence is enumerated as one of the offences under section 103.378. But in another judgment Supreme Court held that there is no law that right of self-defence cannot be exercised in relation to a dispute over an open space.379. Where the trespasser was in settled possession of the ﬁeld in question, and the party who claimed ownership started ploughing the ﬁeld, it was held that the trespasser (accused) had the right of private defence of his possession over property and offer resistance, but that he exceeded that right in causing death. His act fell under exception 2 to section 300 and punishable under section 304, Part I.380. Where a goat of the accused entered the ﬁeld of another and he was trying to take it way, the other struck him with lathi blows and also his companion who came to his rescue. Only then the accused retaliated with lathi blows resulting in death. Supreme Court upheld the acquittal.381. The right is subject to restrictions imposed by section 99, the accused party was in possession of the land, the deceased party wanted to enter into possession forcibly. One of the aggressors was killed and another grievously hurt. The accused that caused the death was held to be guilty of exceeding the right of private defence. The acquittal of the person who caused grievous hurt with a spear was held to be not proper. He was liable to be convicted under section 326.382. Accused having not been in settled possession had no right to self-defence to defend the possession of the property.383. Occurrence took place on the land which was in possession of deceased. Accused cannot take the plea of private defence.384. No right of private defence of property to a person who was not in possession of the property.385. Where the accused to a certain stage acted in defence of their property but exceeded it in breaking into the room of their victim, striking him with a lathi blow and also his wife and daughter who were also there in the room, the victim subsequently dying, their   conviction was shifted from under section 302 to that under section 304 Part 1.386. The right of private defence of property (share in land) was held to have been exceeded when the deceased's side being armed with lathis only, the accused party ﬁred at them with a gun, killing one and injuring others. The right of private defence was not available to them.387. Where the ﬁnding of the Courts below was that the accused and his companions were aggressors because they assaulted the victim and his children when they came out to protest against cutting of their by the accused, it was held that the beneﬁt of the right of private defence was not available to the accused.388. Defence of property may create circumstances ripening into the right of defence of person. This is so because even in defending property, the attack and counter-attack is likely to be on person. This was the situation in a case in which the accused while defending land over which they had possession; they became the victim of attack on person with sharp cutting weapons. It became their right to repel the danger of grievous hurt or even death and to use for that purpose reasonably appropriate force. Their right extended to cause death of the aggressors if that could be the only way of saving themselves.389."

It was held that though the accused had the right of private defence, he had obviously exceeded it and was, therefore, liable under section 304-Part I, IPC, 1860.390. A somewhat contrary view has, however, been taken by the Supreme Court in a later case where too the accused had exercised his right of private defence against a lathi blow on the head. Thus, in Deo Narain's case it has been held that the accused was justiﬁed in using his spear though the other party had aimed only a lathi blow on the head, which being a vulnerable part even a lathi blow could prove dangerous.391. It thus, appears that the part of the body against which the attack is directed is more important than the weapon used. Where the deceased attacked the accused with a stick and the accused retaliated by stabbing the former to death his offence fell under section 304-Part I, IPC, 1860, as he had exceeded the right of private defence.392. Evidence on record showed that accused had received many injuries on his person, and exercised right of private defence of person in good faith. He had sustained four injuries on various parts of his body including on vital parts, thus, case would be covered by Exception 2 to section 300 of IPC, 1860. The nature of weapon used, circumstances in which incident took place, injuries on body of accused as well as deceased, showed that there was no premeditation. He had exercised his right of self-defence but having regard to the injuries inﬂicted by him on deceased, he exceeded same.393. Where the accused, a person with only one hand was attacked with a bamboo and sustained several injuries and then to ward off further attack gave only one blow with a pen-knife on the aggressor which unfortunately fell on a vital part resulting in his death, it could not be said that he had exceeded his right of private defence. For the accused it was a case of life or death struggle and his case, therefore, squarely fell within the ambit of clauses (1) and (2) of section 100, IPC, 1860, and he could not be held guilty of any offence.394. In a sudden group clash over a house both sides received injuries and one person was killed. There was no prior enmity between two groups and the whole incident developed suddenly. Accused persons received quite a number of injuries, some on vital parts, and the prosecution was not able to explain those injuries. It was held that the accused could not be said to have exceeded the right of private defence. Their conviction was set aside.395. Two   armed bullies of a locality raided a ﬂat in a drunken state and demanded money from the inmates with the use of force. This amounted to the crime of extortion giving the inmates the right to defend themselves against the raiders. Both the raiders met their death in the process of the ensuing scuﬄe, it being not known nor capable of being ascertained who played what roll in the combat. The Supreme Court held that it could not be said of any one of them that he exceeded the right of private defence. Hence, they could not be convicted under section 302 read with section 34.396. The accused using his licenced gun ﬁred only one shot after receiving a severe blow on his head fracturing his skull. It was held that he did not exceed his right of self-defence.397. A person had a lurking suspicion about illicit relations between his elder brother's wife and the accused and he caught hold of the accused when the latter visited their house to meet her. The accused inﬂicted knife injuries on him to extricate himself but did not inﬂict any further injury after freeing himself. It was held that the accused had not exceeded the right of private defence and was not guilty under section 307 for attempted murder.398. Where the accused ﬁred a single gunshot at the deceased party to save his uncle who had received serious injuries in the attack made by the deceased party, the gun shot unfortunately proved fatal, the accused could not be said to have exceeded his right of self- defence.399. Where in a murder case over obstruction of water course, the victim assaulted the accused twice and injured him whereupon the accused inﬂicted a blow on him which proved fatal, the accused could not be said to have exceeded his right of private defence.400. A police party was looking for the accused to affect their arrest. The complainant party was helping the police. On being located, the accused party opened ﬁre. The police withdrew after receiving injuries. Two members of the complainant party were killed. Even a runaway complainant was shot down. This showed that the attack continued even when all danger to the accused party had ceased. Thus, they exceeded the right of private defence. Conviction for murder was upheld.401. Where the death occurred due to the ﬁring resorted to as part of the self-defence, the same would amount to 'culpable homicide not amounting to murder', which was committed without any pre-meditation in a sudden ﬁght, in the heat of passion and upon a sudden quarrel and that the offender could not be said to have taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner, which would normally fall under Exception 4 of section 300 IPC, 1860.402."

It places an important restriction on the exercise of the right of defence. The right of private defence being granted for defence only, it must not and cannot legally be exercised when there is time to have recourse to the protection of public authorities. The right of private defence does not take the place of the functions of those public servants who are especially charged with the protection of life and property and the apprehension of offenders, and where the assistance of the public authorities can be procured, the right cannot be lawfully exercised. But the law does not intend that a person must run away to have recourse to the protection of public authorities when he is attacked instead of defending himself.419. A person in possession cannot be   expected to leave his property at the mercy of armed trespassers. Where there is imminent danger to the property and the person in possession apprehends substantial damage thereto, he is entitled to raise his own arms in defence and retaliate to keep away the attack without applying for State aid.420. Where the accused was in rightful possession of the property by virtue of a Court order; under section 145 Cr PC, 1973, he had every right to throw out the complainant party from the land and demolish the construction stealthily put up thereon.421. The important considerations which always arise in order to determine whether the action of the accused is covered by the right of private defence are, ﬁrst, what is the nature of the apprehended danger, and, second, whether there was time to have recourse to the police authorities, always remembering that when both the parties are determined to ﬁght and go up to the land fully armed in full expectation of an armed conﬂict in order to have a trial of strength the right of private defence disappears.422."

At about three o'clock next morning he was informed that the complainants had entered on his land and were ploughing up the corn. Thereupon he at once proceeded to the spot, followed by the remaining accused, and remonstrated with the complainants, who commenced an attack on the accused. In the ﬁght which ensued, both sides received serious injuries, and the leader of the complainants' party was killed. It was held that the complainants being the aggressors, the accused had the right of private defence and that they were not bound to act on the information received on the previous evening and seek the protection of the public authorities, as they had no reason to apprehend a night attack on their property.423. In a case involving an old land dispute, one party (accused) offered resistance to prevent the other from ploughing the land and on refusal went up to the place where the other was sitting without arms and inﬂicted stick blows causing death, it was held that the accused was rightly convicted. The Court said that a rightful owner can defend his possession against any attempt to dislodge him, but that once a trespasser has established his foothold; resort should be had to public authorities.424. The right of private defence does not extend to inﬂicting of more harm than necessary for the purpose of defence. The prosecution party, in this case, had gone to plough the land which was in the possession of the accused (appellant). The latter had time to go and report the matter to appropriate authorities constituted under the law. But instead of so doing, they brutally attacked the other party resulting in the death of three persons. Thus, there was no right of private defence. It was held that there was no warrant for converting the conviction from u/section 302 to section 304 Part II.425."

            "sub_section_description": "The right of private defence is restricted to not inﬂicting more harm than it is necessary to inﬂict for the purpose of defence. The amount of force necessarily depends on the circumstances of the case, and there is no protection if the harm is caused by excessive violence quite unnecessary to the case.426. For example, a person set by his master to watch a garden or yard is not at all justiﬁed in shooting at, or injuring in any way, persons who may come into those premises, even in the night. He ought ﬁrst to see whether he could not take measures for their apprehension.427. The measure of self-defence must always be proportionate to the quantum of force used by the attacker and which it is necessary to repel.428. In dealing with the question as to   whether more force is used than is necessary or than was justiﬁed by the prevailing circumstances, it would be inappropriate to adopt tests of detached objectivity of a Court room. The means which a threatened person adopts or the force which he uses should not be weighed in golden scales.429. Though a person exercising his right of private defence is not expected to modulate his defence step by step or tier by tier, yet it is necessary to see that it is not totally disproportionate to the injury sought to be averted, e.g., to ward off a slap one cannot ﬁre a gun. Thus, where the father of the accused was allegedly assaulted with lathis which resulted in simple injuries, the accused was not justiﬁed in ﬁring his gun and thereby killing the attacker. In such a case it could not be said that there was a reasonable apprehension of death or grievous hurt within the meaning of clause (1) of section 100, IPC, 1860.430. But at the same time it should also be remembered that if a man has real justiﬁcation to exercise his right of private defence, he cannot be held liable if he slightly exceeds his right of private defence, e.g., where face to face with a murderous attack he ﬁres two shots in quick succession, for these things cannot be weighed in golden scales.431. The right of private defence should not be allowed to be pleaded or availed of as pretext for a vindictive, aggressive or retributive purpose.432."

In such a situation accused persons could have a reasonable apprehension of death or at least of grievous hurt. It was a case of single gunshot which was not repeated. Therefore, it cannot be said that the accused persons had exceeded their right of private defence in any manner.434.

Where, on the other hand, two drunk and armed raiders demanded money from the residents of a ﬂat and in face to face with the inmates who resisted them, lost their lives, it being not known which inmate played what role, the Supreme Court held that it could not be said that more harm was caused than was necessary.445. Where the accused caused death in order to repel an attack by a party armed with lethal weapons and which had already caused injuries to the accused, it was held that the accused did not exceed his rights as it was not possible for him to have weighed in golden scales in the heat of the moment the number of injuries required to overcome the attack.446. Where the accused continued to assault the deceased even after he fell to the ground, the possibility of causing injuries in exercise of his right of private defence was ruled out.447.

        "section_comments": "The law authorizes a man who is under a reasonable apprehension that his life is in danger or his body in risk of grievous hurt to inﬂict death upon his assailant either when the assault is attempted or directly threatened, but the apprehension must be reasonable and the violence inﬂicted must not be greater than is reasonably necessary for the purpose of self-defence. It must be proportionate to and commensurate with the quality and character of the act it is intended to meet and what is done in excess is not protected. Where the accused was attacked by three persons and sustained an injury on the forehead, a vital part, he had reasonable apprehension of some hurt to be caused to him and had the right of self-defence but had exceeded by causing more harm to his assailants than needed. He was liable under section 304, Part I, and not under section 302.450. Where after receiving nine injuries, two on vital parts, the accused ﬁred one shot from his gun which hit fatally an innocent person, the right of private defence extending to cause death was still available to the accused. His conviction under section 304, Part I was set aside.451. Where the complainant's party had deliberately gathered near the house of the accused and scolded them and caused injuries to his father, the accused was held justiﬁed in exercising the right of private defence to defend his father and his conviction under section 300 was set aside.452. It is the reasonable apprehension of death or grievous hurt that gives rise to the right of private defence under clauses (1) and (2) of section 100, IPC, 1860., and it has got nothing to do with the actual injury that the person exercising the right of private defence has suffered, which may or may not be grievous.453. Where the accused fails to make out a case of reasonable apprehension, he cannot claim the right of private defence.454. Where the life of the accused was not endangered by the ladies armed with broom sticks and 'chappals', the accused was not entitled to stab one of the ladies to death in exercise of right of private defence.455.   The extended right of private defence to the extent of causing death of the assailant arises only if the offence which occasions the exercise of the right is of one of the kinds mentioned in this section.456. Following some earlier rulings, the Supreme Court has re-emphasised that the mere fact of the accused sustaining some injuries in the course of the same transaction does not make it out conclusively that the accused had the occasion to cause death in private defence.457. Where the attacking party chanced to get at the wife of the accused and the latter pounced upon them with a weapon attacking one of them which was warded off, another came forward and the accused successfully struck him and he died, the accused was held to be within his rights.458. As against this where two were ﬁghting with lathis and the brother of one of them, who was outside the danger, struck a lathi blow to the other killing him, he was held to be guilty under section 304-I.459. In a communal tension, both sides pelted stones. The accused ﬁred a gun shot causing death of a person of the other group though no one had sustained any injury as a result of pelting of stones by the other group. It was held that the accused had no occasion to act under the right of private defence.460. In order to justify the act of causing death of assailant, the accused has simply to satisfy the Court that there was reasonable apprehension of death or grievous hurt. Question whether the apprehension was reasonable or not is a question of fact depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case and no straitjacket formula can be prescribed in this regard. Weapon used, the manner and nature of assault and other surrounding circumstances should be taken into account while evaluating whether the apprehension was justiﬁed or not. In the instant case, accused G was assaulted on head by a sharp-edged weapon which caused a bone-deep injury. As per the defence version there were four assailants who had come well prepared at the door of accused's house to commit assault. Reasonable apprehension of death or at least of grievous hurt, therefore, could not be ruled out. In such a situation, if single gunshot was ﬁred it could not be said that the accused persons had exceeded their right of private defence in any manner.461.",

Thus, a woman could not be taken away by force even by her own husband from a paramour's house and if in these circumstances the paramour and his brother killed the husband to prevent her abduction by the husband, they would be protected by sub-clause (5) of section 100 of the Penal Code.463. Here law seems to be contrary to our social conscience, but this interpretation is perfectly in accord with the language of section 100, IPC, 1860, and the decision of the Supreme Court in Viswanath's case464. where too the husband was put to death by a clean stab by his brother-in-law as he was trying to take away his wife by force from his father-in-law's house and in the process had merely dragged his unwilling wife to some distance."

Preponderance of probabilities in favour of the defence is enough to discharge the burden.476.

But number of injuries is not always considered to be a safe criterion for determining who the aggressor was.

Defence has to further to show that injuries so caused on accused probabilise version of private defence. Non-explanation of injuries sustained by the accused at about the time of occurrence or in course of the altercation is a very important circumstance but mere non-explanation may not affect prosecution case in all cases.477.

As there was no apprehension of death or grievous hurt to his person, the accused could not get the beneﬁt of clauses (1) and (2) of section 100 or section 103, IPC, 1860. He had only a limited right of private defence to cause any other harm than death within the meaning of section 101, IPC, 1860, and as such having exercised his right of private defence he was liable to be convicted under section 304-Part I, IPC, 1860.480. The accused was hit by a single brickbat or a stone piece and suffered a simple head-injury. After sometime he ﬁred at the unarmed assailant causing grievous injury to his abdomen. The Supreme Court held that keeping in mind his simple hurt and the time gap between that and the gunshot wound caused by him, his action was a retaliation rather than act of private defence. His conviction under section 326 was accordingly upheld.481. The right of private defence was held to have been exceeded where a member of the opposite side was killed after snatching his pistol.482. The person who died came along with his brothers to stage a ﬁght with the accused because of an earlier act of insult on the part of the accused.

The right lasts so long as the reasonable apprehension of the danger to the body continues.484. It commences and continues as long as danger to body lasts. The extent to which the exercise of the right will be justiﬁed will depend not on the actual danger but on whether there was reasonable apprehension of such danger. There must be an attempt or threat and consequent thereon an apprehension of danger; but it is not a mere idle threat, or every apprehension of a rash or timid mind, that will justify the exercise of the right. Reasonable ground for the apprehension is requisite. Suppose the threat to proceed from a woman or child and to be addressed to a strong man, in such a case there could hardly be a reasonable apprehension. Present and imminent danger seems to be meant.485. The person exercising a right of private defence must consider whether the threat to his person or his property is real and immediate. If he reaches the conclusion reasonably that the threat is immediate and real, he is entitled to exercise his right. In the exercise of his right, he must use force necessary for the purpose and he must stop using the force as soon as the threat has disappeared. So long as the threat lasts and the right of private defence can be legitimately exercised; if the danger is continuing, the right is there; if the danger or the apprehension about it has ceased to exist there is no longer the right of private defence.486. Right commences, as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body arises from an attempt, or threat, or commit the offence, although the offence may not have been committed but not until that there is that reasonable apprehension.

There is no right to inﬂict punishment on the wrong-doer for his past act after the apprehension has ceased to exist. The right of defence ends with the necessity for it. So where the deceased was ﬂeeing for his life, there was no justiﬁcation to shoot him down. This would be a sheer case of murder and nothing else.488. Where the testimony of the independent witness showed that the accused chased one of the deceased who ﬂed away from the scene of occurrence and killed him, they could not be said to have right of private defence as regards the killing of such deceased.489. Though the nature of apprehension depends upon the nature of weapon intended to be used or used, it cannot be said that as the complainant's party had only used lathis, the accused was not justiﬁed in using his spear especially when a blow with a lathi was aimed at a vulnerable part like the head.490.",

A person employed to guard the property of his employer is protected by sections 97, 99, 103 and 105 if he causes death in safeguarding his employer's property when there is reason to apprehend that the person whose death has been caused was about to commit one of the offences mentioned in this section or to attempt to commit one of those offences. A person whose duty it is to guard a public building is in the same position, that is to say, it is his duty to protect the property of his employer and he may take such steps for this purpose as the law permits. The fact that the property to be guarded is public property does not extend the protection given to a guard. Therefore, a police constable on guard duty at a magazine or other public building is not entitled to ﬁre at a person merely because the latter does not answer his challenge.491. The deceased, none of whom was in possession of any dangerous weapons, were harvesting crop on a plot of land with peaceful intention under the protection of police. The accused who claimed the crops did not approach the authorities for redress, although they had time to do so, sent away the police constables by a ruse and then attacked the deceased with guns and other dangerous weapons and shot them down at close range. It was held by the Supreme Court that the acts of the deceased did not amount to robbery and that the accused had no right of private defence of property.492. The accused was in possession of the plots which were under litigation. Finding his opponent, a blind man, getting the plots ploughed, the accused asked him to stop ploughing. On this, 8–10 persons armed with spears and 'lathis' proceeded towards him. The accused ﬁred a shot from his gun causing death of his opponent, the blind man. The Court observed that a blind villager could not be thought of going to take possession of the plots without mobilising enough man power to deal with resistance likely to be put up by his adversary. It was held that in the circumstances the right of private defence of the person became available to the accused.493. In the words of the Supreme Court, the High Court committed an error in relation to the plea of self-defence raised on behalf of the accused to the effect that the incident took place at an open space. There is no law that the right of self-defence cannot be exercised in relation to an open space.494. Reasonable force may be used in defence of property.

Explanation 1.—A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a material fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing. ILLUSTRATION A, a public oﬃcer is authorised by a warrant from a Court of Justice to apprehend Z. B, knowing that fact and also that C is not Z, wilfully represents to A that C is Z, and thereby intentionally causes A to apprehend C. Here B abets by instigation the apprehension of C. Explanation 2.—Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid the doing of that act.  COMMENTS.— In common parlance, the word 'abet' means assistance, co-operation and encouragement and includes wrongful purpose. In Corpus Juris Secundum, vol I at p 306, the meaning of the word 'abet' is given as follows: 'To abet' has been deﬁned as meaning to aid; to assist or to give aid; to command, to procure, or to counsel; to countenance; to encourage, counsel, induce, or assist; to encourage or to set another on to commit. Used with 'aid'. The word 'abet' is generally used with the word 'aid' and similar words. In order to bring a person abetting the doing of a thing, under any one of the clauses enumerated under section 107, it is not only necessary to prove that the person who has abetted has taken part in the steps of the transactions but also in some way or other he has been connected with those steps of the transactions which are criminal. The offence of abetment depends upon the intention of the person who abets, and not upon the act which is actually done by the person whom he abets.1. For the purposes of the ﬁrst two clauses of this section it is immaterial whether the person instigated commits the offence or not or the persons conspiring together   actually carry out the object of the conspiracy.2. It is only in the case of a person abetting an offence by intentionally aiding another to commit that offence that the charge of abetment against him would be expected to fail when the person alleged to have committed the offence is acquitted of that offence.3. The Court noted that in Faguna Kanta Nath v State of Assam4. the appellant was tried for an offence under section 165A for having abetted the commission of an offence by an oﬃcer, who was acquitted, and it was held that the appellant's conviction for abetment was also not maintainable. But subsequently in Jamuna Singh v State of Bihar,5. it was considered not desirable to hold that an abettor cannot be punished if the person actually committing the offence is acquitted. The Court said that the abettor's guilt depends upon the nature of the offence abetted and the manner of abetment. It is only in cases of intentional aiding that the abettor would have to be acquitted with the principal offender.6. Following this state of the rulings the Supreme Court ordered the acquittal of the single abettor when the main offender as also all other abettors already stood acquitted. The Supreme Court has reiterated that before anybody can be punished for abetment of suicide, it must be proved that the death in question was a suicidal death.7. The Supreme Court held that the offence of abetment is a separate and independent offence. Where the offence is committed in consequence of the abetment but there is no provision for punishment of such abetment, the abettor is to be punished along with the offender for the original offence.8. Abetment is constituted by: (1) instigating a person to commit an offence; or (2) engaging in a conspiracy to commit it; or (3) intentionally aiding a person to commit it.  The offence of abetment by instigation depends upon the intention of the person who abets and not upon the act which is done by the person who has abetted. The abetment may be by instigation, conspiracy or intentional aid as provided under section 107, Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860. However, the words uttered in a ﬁt of anger or omission without any intention cannot be termed as instigation.9.",

Mere proof, that the crime charged could not have been committed without involvement and/or interposition of the alleged abettor is not enough compliance with the requirements of section 107.

In such circumstances, should the individual, i.e., the sting operator be held criminally liable for commission of the offence that is inherent and inseparable from the process by which commission of another offence is sought to be established? What about the operator who has mens rea or guilty intention to commit the offence? These are puzzling questions when there is an allegation that the sting operator is alleged to have committed the abetment of the offence. The Supreme Court in Rajat Prasad v CBI,12. observed that a crime does not stand obliterated or extinguished merely because its commission is claimed to be in public interest. At the same time, the criminal intent (mens rea) behind the commission of the act will have to be established before the liability of the person charged with the commission of crime can be adjudged. The Court held that the questions whether the sting operation is a journalistic exercise and any criminal intent can be imputed are to be answered by the evidence of the parties. (1) Abetment by instigation.—First clause.—A person is said to 'instigate' another to an act, when he actively suggests or stimulates him to the act by any means of language, direct or indirect, whether it takes the form of express solicitation, or of hints, insinuation or encouragement.13."

            "sub_section_description": "Instigation is to goad, urge forward, provoke, incite or encourage to do \"an act\". To satisfy the requirement of \"instigation\", though it is not necessary that actual words must be used to that effect or what constitutes \"instigation\" must necessarily and speciﬁcally be suggestive of the consequence. Yet a reasonable certainty to incite the consequence must be capable of being spelt out. Where the accused had, by his acts or omission or by a continued course of conduct, created such circumstances that the deceased was left with no other option except to commit suicide, in which case, \"instigation\" may have to be inferred. A word uttered in a ﬁt of anger or emotion without intending the consequences to actually follow, cannot be said to be instigation. Thus, to constitute 'instigation', a person who instigates another has to provoke, incite, urge or encourage the doing of an act by the other by \"goading\" or 'urging forward'. The dictionary meaning of the word \"goad\" is \"a thing that stimulates someone into action; provoke to action or reaction … to keep irritating or annoying somebody until he reacts\".14. The word \"instigate\" literally means to provoke, incite, urge on or bring about by persuasion to do anything. The abetment may be by instigation, conspiracy or intentional aid as provided in the three clauses of the section.15. Instigate means the active role played by a person with a view to stimulate another person to do the thing. In order to hold a person guilty of abetting it must be established that he had intentionally done something which amounted to instigating another to do a thing.16. Instigation may be of an unknown person.17. A mere acquiescence or permission does not amount to instigation.18."

Without a positive act on the part of the accused to instigate or aid in committing suicide, conviction cannot be sustained.21. Deceased committed suicide by hanging himself because of alleged illicit relationship between his wife and the accused. Accused took the wife of deceased away from the house of her brother and kept her with him for four days. There is deﬁnitely a proximity and nexus between the conduct and behaviour of the accused and wife of deceased with that of suicide committed by the deceased.22. Where a married girl committed suicide by burning herself in her in-law's house, her in-laws were held guilty of abetment because they were persistently torturing her for inadequate dowry and had gone to the extent of accusing her of illegitimate pregnancy.23. \"All these tortures and taunts\", Ray J said,24. \"Caused depression in her mind and drove her to take the extreme step of putting an end to her life by sprinkling kerosene oil on her person and setting it aﬁre.\" In another case of the same kind a husband persistently demanded more money from his wife, quarrelling with her everyday. On the fateful day when she happened to say that death would have been better than this, she heard only this in reply that her husband would feel relieved if she ended her life. Immediately thereafter she set herself on ﬁre. The husband was held guilty of instigating her to commit suicide.25. Mere harassment of wife by husband due to differences per se does not attract section 306 read with section 107, IPC, 1860.26. Demand of loan amount by accused from deceased itself does not come within the scope of abetment as deﬁned under section 107.27. Goading and intimidating a debtor with a view to pressurising him for repayment of the loan which brought about a suicide by the debtor immediately thereafter, was held as not amounting to abetment of suicide and, therefore, no case under section 306 read with section 34 was made out.28. The accused told the other person \"to go and die\". It was held that this would not in itself satisfy the ingredients of instigation. Instigation has to be with mens rea. The suicide was committed two days after the quarrel between the accused and the deceased. This also showed that the suicide was not the direct result of the quarrel. The suicide note indicated that her husband was a frustrated man and given to drinking and suffered from great stress and depression.29.   The accused, a Motor Vehicle Inspector, beat up and abused a driver for not being able to produce necessary papers. The driver committed suicide. The Court said that it was not shown that he was guilty of any act of abetment within the meaning of section 107. The charge against him under section 107 was quashed.30."

In order to prove that the accused abetted commission of suicide by a person, it has to be established that: (i) the accused kept on irritating or annoying the deceased by words, deeds or wilful  omission or conduct which may even be a wilful silence until the deceased reacted or pushed or forced the deceased by his deeds, words or wilful omission or conduct to make the deceased move forward more quickly in a forward direction; and (ii) that the accused had the intention to provoke urge or encourage the deceased  to commit suicide while acting in the manner noted above.

In a particular case, there may not be direct evidence in regard to instigation which may have direct nexus to suicide. Therefore, in such a case, an inference has to be drawn from the circumstances and it is to be determined whether circumstances had been such which in fact had created the situation that a person felt totally frustrated and committed suicide.35. (2) Abetment by conspiracy.—Second clause.—'Conspiracy' consists in the agreement of two or more [persons] to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. So long as such a design rests in intention only, it is not indictable. When two agree to carry it into effect, the very plot is an act in itself, and the act of each of the parties, promise against promise, actus contra actum, capable of being enforced, if lawful, is punishable if for a criminal object or for the use of criminal means.36. It is not necessary that the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is suﬃcient if he engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed.37. Where parties concert together, and have a common object, the act of   one of the parties, done in furtherance of the common object and in pursuance of the concerted plan, is the act of all.38. Before the introduction of Chapter V-A, conspiracy, except in cases provided for by sections 121A, 311, 400, 401 and 402 of the Code, was a mere species of abetment when an act or an illegal omission took place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and amounted to a distinct offence for each distinct offence abetted by conspiracy.39. For an offence under the second clause of this section a mere combination of persons or agreement is not enough; an act or illegal omission must take place in pursuance of the conspiracy. But for an offence under section 120A a mere agreement is enough if the agreement is to commit an offence.40."

            "sub_section_description": "Criminal conspiracy postulates an agreement between two or more persons to do, or cause to be done, an illegal act or an act which is not illegal, by illegal, means. It differs from other offences because mere agreement is made an offence even if no step is taken to carry out that agreement. Though there is close association of conspiracy with incitement and abetment the substantive offence of criminal conspiracy is somewhat wider in amplitude than abetment by conspiracy as contemplated under section 107, IPC, 1860.41. There is no analogy between section 120B and section 109, IPC, 1860. There may be an element of abetment in a conspiracy, but conspiracy is something more than an abetment. Offences created by sections 109 and 120B, iPC, 1860 are quite distinct and there is no warrant for limiting the prosecution to only one element of conspiracy, that is, abetment when the allegation is that what a person did was something over and above that.42. (3) Abetment by aid.—Third clause.—By act.—A person, it is trite, abets by aiding, when by any act done either prior to, or at the time of the commission of an act, he intends to facilitate and does in fact facilitate the commission thereof, would attract the third clause of section 107 of the IPC, 1860. Doing something for the offender is not abetment. Doing something with knowledge so as to facilitate him to commit the crime or otherwise would constitute abetment.43. In order to constitute abetment by aiding within the meaning of the third paragraph of section 107, IPC, 1860 the abettor must be shown to have intentionally aided the commission of the crime. A person may invite another casually or for a friendly purpose and that may facilitate the murder of the invitee. But unless it is shown that the invitation was extended with a view to facilitate the commission of the murder, it cannot be said that the person extending the invitation had abetted the murder. The language used in the section is \"intentionally aids\" and therefore, active complicity is the gist of the offence of abetment under the third paragraph of section 107, IPC, 1860.44. Abetment includes instigating any person to do a thing or engaging with one or more persons in any conspiracy for the doing of a thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, or intentional aid by any act or illegal omission to the doing of that thing. On facts held, in the instant case, there was no direct evidence to establish that the appellant either aided or instigated the deceased to commit suicide or entered into any conspiracy to aid her in committing suicide.45. Where the principal offender killed the victim with a knife provided by the defendant who later claimed that he thought the knife would be used only to threaten, the defendant's conviction for murder was upheld, the Court of Appeal saying that the trial judge was correct to direct the jury that the defendant could be so convicted if he contemplated that the principal offender might kill or cause serious bodily harm to the victim as part of their joint enterprise.46. It is not necessary that the abettor should be present at the place of the occurrence. It is also not necessary to show that the secondary party to a conspiracy to   murder intended the victim to be killed provided it is proved that he contemplated or foresaw the event as a real or substantial risk. Mere absence from the scene of the crime cannot amount to unequivocal communication of withdrawal from the enterprise. The accused was recruited with certain others by a person to kill his wife. At a predetermined time she was taken to the agreed place and killed. The accused was not present when the killing took place. It was held that he was rightly convicted in that he had lent encouragement and assistance before the commission of the crime.47."

Explanation 1.—The abetment of the illegal omission of an act may amount to an offence although the abettor may not himself be bound to do that act. Explanation 2.—To constitute the offence of abetment it is not necessary that the act abetted should be committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused. ILLUSTRATIONS (a) A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to  commit murder. (b) A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D recovers  from the wound. A is guilty of instigating B to commit murder. Explanation 3.—It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law of committing an offence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the abettor, or any guilty intention or knowledge. ILLUSTRATIONS (a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic to commit an act which would  be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence, and having the same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be committed or not, is guilty of abetting an offence. (b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of  age, to do an act which causes Z's death. B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z's death. Here though B was not capable by law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an offence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death. (c) A instigates B to set ﬁre to a dwelling-house. B, in consequence of the  unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets ﬁre to the house in consequence of A's instigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting ﬁre to a dwelling-house, and is liable to the punishment provided for that offence. (d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property   belonging to Z out of Z's possession. A induces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z's possession, in good faith, believing it to be A's property. B, acting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of abetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft. Explanation 4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is also an offence. ILLUSTRATION A instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C commits that offence in consequence of B's instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B to commit the offence, A is also liable to the same punishment. Explanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is suﬃcient if he engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed. ILLUSTRATION A concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall administer the poison. B then explains the plan to C mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A's name. C agrees to procure the poison, and procures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. A administers the poison; Z dies in consequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which Z has been murdered. C has therefore committed the offence deﬁned in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder.  COMMENTS.— Abetment under the IPC, 1860 involves active complicity on the part of the abettor at a point of time prior to the actual commission of the offence,59. and it is of the essence of the crime of abetment that the abettor should substantially assist the principal culprit towards the commission of the offence. Nowhere, concurrence in the criminal acts of another without such participation therein as helps to give effect to the criminal act or purpose, is punishable under the Code. 'Abettor', under this section, means the person who abets (1) the commission of an offence, or (2) the commission of an act, which would be an offence if committed by a person not suffering from any physical or mental incapacity. In the light of the preceding section he must be an instigator or a conspirator or an intentional helper. Merely because the accused's brother was carrying on criminal activities in her house, the appellant cannot be held guilty unless there is some material to show her complicity.60. Explanation 1.—If a public servant is guilty of an illegal omission of duty made punishable by the Code, and a private person instigates him, then he abets the offence of which such public servant is guilty, though the abettor, being a private person, could not himself have been guilty of that offence.   Explanation 2.—The question regarding abettor's guilt depends on the nature of the act abetted and the manner in which abetment was made. Commission of the act abetted is not necessary for the offence of abetment.61. The offence of abetment is complete notwithstanding that the person abetted refuses to do the thing, or fails involuntarily in doing it, or does it and the expected result does not follow. The offence of abetment by instigation depends upon the intention of the person who abets, and not upon the act which is actually done by the person whom he abets. Explanation 3.—This explanation makes it clear that the person abetted need not have any guilty intention in committing the act abetted. It applies to abetment generally and there is nothing to indicate that it applies only to abetment by instigation and not to other kinds of abetment.62. The offence of abetment depends upon the intention of the person who abets and not upon the knowledge or intention of the person he employs to act for him. Explanation 4.—This Explanation is to be read as follows: \"When the abetment of an offence is an offence the abetment of such an abetment is also an offence\". In view of Explanation 4 appended under section 108 of the IPC, 1860 the contention of accused that there cannot be any abetment of an abetment and it is unknown to criminal jurisprudence, holds no water and merits no consideration.63.",

Under section 107, IPC, 1860 a person abets the doing of an act in either of three ways which can be: instigating any person to do an act; or engaging with one or more person in any conspiracy for the doing of that act; or intentionally aiding the doing of that act. If a person instigates another or engages with another in a conspiracy for the doing of an act which is an offence, he abets such an offence and would be guilty of abetment under section 115 or section 116, IPC, 1860 even if the offence abetted is not committed in consequence of the abetment. The offence of abetment is complete when the alleged abettor has instigated another or engaged with another in a conspiracy to commit the offence. It is not necessary for the offence of abetment that the act abetted must be committed. This is clear from Explanation 2 and illustration (a) thereto, to section 108, IPC, 1860. It is only in the case of a person abetting an offence by intentionally aiding another to commit that offence that the charge of abetment against him would be expected to fail when the person alleged to have committed the offence is acquitted of that offence.69."

Explanation.—An act or offence is said to be committed in consequence of abetment, when it is committed in consequence of the instigation, or in pursuance of the conspiracy, or with the aid which constitutes the abetment. ILLUSTRATIONS (a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing A some favour in  the exercise of B's oﬃcial functions. B accepts the bribe. A has abetted the offence deﬁned in section 161. (b) A instigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence of the instigation,  commits that offence. A is guilty of abetting that offence, and is liable to the same punishment as B. (c) A and B conspire to poison Z. A, in pursuance of the conspiracy, procures the  poison and delivers it to B in order that he may administer it to Z. B, in pursuance of the conspiracy, administers the poison to Z in A's absence and thereby causes Z's death. Here B is guilty of murder. A is guilty of abetting that offence by conspiracy, and is liable to the punishment for murder.  COMMENTS.— Under this section the abettor is liable to the same punishment as that which may be inﬂicted on the principal offender, (1) if the act of the latter is committed in consequence of the abetment, and (2) no express provision is made in the Code for the punishment of such an abetment. Section 109, IPC, 1860 becomes applicable even if the abettor is not present when the offence abetted is committed provided that he has instigated the commission of the offence or has engaged with one or more other persons in a conspiracy to commit an offence and pursuant to that conspiracy some act or illegal omission takes place or has intentionally aided the commission of an offence by an act or illegal omission.76.",

But mere failure to prevent the commission of an offence is not by itself an abetment of that offence. Considering the deﬁnition in section 109 strictly, the instigation must have reference to the thing that was done and not to the thing that was likely to have been done by the person who is instigated. It is only if this condition is fulﬁlled that a person can be guilty of abetment by instigation. Section 109 is attracted even if the abettor is not present when the offence abetted is committed provided that he had instigated the commission of the offence or had engaged with one or more other persons in a conspiracy to commit an offence and pursuant to the conspiracy some act or illegal omission takes place or intentionally induced the commission of an offence by an act or illegal omission. In the absence of direct involvement, conviction for abetment is not sustainable.

B and C instigated A to rob the deceased on his return to home after receiving a sum of money; whereupon A killed the deceased.

COMMENTS.— This section extends the principle enunciated in the preceding section. Under it the abettor is punished for the offence abetted as well as the offence committed.

COMMENTS.— This section: is only brought into operation when circumstances amounting to abetment of a particular crime have ﬁrst been proved, and then the presence of the accused at the commission of that crime is proved in addition … Section 114 deals with the case, where there has been the crime of abetment, but where also there has been actual commission of the crime abetted and the abettor has been present thereat, and the way in which it deals with such a case is this. Instead of the crime being still abetment with circumstances of aggravation, the crime becomes the very crime abetted. The section is evidently not punitory. Because participation de facto. … may sometimes be obscure in detail, it is established by the presumption Juris et de jure that actual presence plus prior abetment can mean nothing else but participation. The presumption raised by s. 114 brings the case within the ambit of s. 34.97.  The meaning of this section is that if the nature of the act done constitutes abetment, then, if present, the abettor is to be deemed to have committed the offence, though in point of fact another actually committed it. The abetment must be complete apart from the mere presence of the abettor.98. The words \"who if absent would be liable to be punished as an abettor\" clearly show that abetment must be one prior to the commission of the offence and complete by itself.99. Where, for instance, a blow is struck by A, in the presence of, and by the order of, B, both are principals in the transaction. If A instigates B to murder, he commits abetment; if absent, he is punishable as an abettor, and if the offence is committed, then under section 109; if present, he is by this section deemed to have committed the offence and is punishable as a principal. This section applies to cases where a person abets the commission of the offence sometime before at a different place and also remains present at the time the offence is committed.100. But where a person is charged with abetment under this section for aiding in the Commission of an offence, e.g., section 300 IPC, 1860 and the person charged as the principal offender is acquitted on the ground that he had not committed the offence in question, no further question arises regarding abettor's liability.101. Section 114 is not applicable in every case in which the abettor is present at the commission of the offence abetted. While section 109 is a section dealing generally with abetment, section 114 applies to those cases only in which not only is the abettor present at the time of the commission of the offence but abetment has been committed prior to and independently of his presence.102.",

In this case the offender is punishable under sections 115 and 116 for the mere abetment to commit a crime. (2) The very act at which the abetment aims may be committed, and will be punishable under sections 109 and 110.

Merely because the section opens with the words \"if any person commits suicide\" it cannot be held that in a case of unsuccessful suicide there is no attempt to abet the commission of suicide. Suicide and its attempt on the one hand and abetment of commission of suicide and its attempt on the other are treated differently by law and, therefore, the one who abets the commission of an unsuccessful attempt to commit suicide cannot be held to be punishable merely under section 309 read with section 116, IPC, 1860. To implement the scheme of law he has got to be held to be punishable under section 306 read with section 511, IPC, 1860.116."

COMMENT— Abetting by public or more than ten persons.—Abetment has a reference both to the person or persons abetted, and to the offence or offences the commission of which is abetted. This section deals with former, whatever may be the nature of the offence abetted, while section 115 deals with the latter without having regard to the person or persons abetted.117.

The gravamen of a charge under this section is the abetment itself, the instigation to general lawlessness, not the particular offence of which the commission is instigated.118. The section covers all offences and is a general provision for abetment of any number of persons exceeding ten. When more than ten persons are instigated to commit an offence punishable with death, the offence comes under section 115 as well as this section.119. Abetment of the commission of murder, whether by a single individual or by a class of persons exceeding ten, falls under section 115. In the latter case, it may fall under this section also, but as this section prescribes a lesser punishment, section 115 is the more appropriate provision for such an offence.

When two or more persons agree to do, or cause to be done,— (1) an illegal act, or (2) an act which is not illegal by illegal means, such an agreement is designated a  criminal conspiracy: Providedthat no agreement except an agreement to commit an offence shall amount to a criminal conspiracy unless some act besides the agreement is done by one or more parties to such agreement in pursuance thereof. Explanation.—It is immaterial whether the illegal act is the ultimate object of such agreement, or is merely incidental to that object.  COMMENT— Criminal conspiracy.—This chapter has introduced into the criminal law of India a new offence, viz., the offence of criminal conspiracy. It came into existence by the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1913. Offence of criminal conspiracy is an exception to the general law where intent alone does not constitute crime. It is intention to commit crime and joining hands with persons having the same intention.2. Law making conspiracy a crime is designed to curb immoderate power to do mischief which is gained by a combination of the means. The encouragement and support which co-conspirators give to one another rendering enterprises possible which, if left to individual effort, would have been impossible, furnish the ground for visiting conspirators and abettors with condign punishment. The conspiracy is held to be continued and renewed as to all its members wherever and whenever any member of the conspiracy acts in furtherance of the common design. Offence of criminal conspiracy has its foundation in an agreement to commit an offence. A conspiracy consists not merely in the intention of two or more, but in the agreement of two or more to do an unlawful act by unlawful means.3. A criminal conspiracy must be put to action inasmuch as so long a crime is generated in the mind of an accused, it does not become punishable. What is necessary is not thoughts, which may even be criminal in character, often involuntary, but offence would be said to have been committed thereunder only when that take concrete shape of an agreement to do or cause to be done an illegal act or an act which although not illegal by illegal means and then if nothing further is done the agreement would give rise to a criminal conspiracy.4.  [s 120A.1] Ingredients.— The ingredients of this offence are—   (1) that there must be an agreement between the persons who are alleged to  conspire; and (2) that the agreement should be (i) for doing of an illegal act, or (ii) for doing by illegal means an act which may not itself be illegal.5.  Meeting of minds of two or more persons for doing or causing to be done an illegal act or an act by illegal means is sine qua non of criminal conspiracy.6. The most important ingredient of the offence being, the agreement between two or more persons to do an illegal act. In a case where criminal conspiracy is alleged, the court must inquire whether the two persons are independently pursuing the same end or they have come together to pursue the unlawful object. The former does not render them as conspirators but the latter does. For the offence of conspiracy some kind of physical manifestation of agreement is required to be established. The express agreement need not be proved. The evidence as to the transmission of thoughts sharing the unlawful act is not suﬃcient. A conspiracy is a continuing offence which continues to subsist till it is executed or rescinded or frustrated by choice of necessity. During its subsistence whenever any one of the conspirators does an act or series of acts, he would be held guilty under section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860).7.  [s 120A.2] Elements of Criminal Conspiracy.— (a) an object to be accomplished, (b) a plan or scheme embodying means to accomplish that object, (c) an agreement or understanding between two or more of the accused persons  whereby, they become deﬁnitely committed to cooperate for the accomplishment of the object by the means embodied in the agreement, or by any effectual means, and (d) in the jurisdiction where the statute required an overt act.8.",

            "sub_section_description": "The concept of war embedded in section 121 is not to be understood in the international law sense of inter-country war involving military operations by and between two or more hostile countries. Section 121 is not meant to punish prisoners of war of a belligerent nation. Apart from the legislative history of the provision and the understanding of the expression by various High Courts during the pre-independence   days, the Illustration to section 121 itself makes it clear that \"war\" contemplated by section 121 is not conventional warfare between two nations. Organising or joining an insurrection against the Government of India is also a form of war.9. Neither the number of persons nor the manner in which they are assembled or armed is material to constitute an offence under this section. The true criterion is the purpose or intention with which the gathering is assembled. The object of the gathering must be to attain by force and violence an object of a general public nature thereby striking directly against the Government's authority.10. In Md Jamiluddin Nasir v State of WB,11. while enumerating what principles are to be kept in mind in cases, involving application of sections 121, 122, 121A read with section 120B IPC, 1860 as well as section 302 IPC, 1860, the Supreme Court, observed inter alia that not all violent behaviour would fall within the prescription of waging war as contemplated under sections 121, 121A, 122 read with section 120B. It was also found that the object sought to be achieved to make a case for the application of section 121, should be directed against the sovereignty of the State and not merely commission of a crime, even if that happens to be of higher magnitude. The concept of 'waging war' should not be stretched too far. A balanced and realistic approach should be maintained while construing the offence committed, to ﬁnd out whether it amounts to waging of war against the State."

The normative phenomenon of war as understood in the   international sense does not ﬁt into the ambit and reach of section 121. In the Parliament attack case,15. the Supreme Court held as follows: while these are the acceptable criteria of waging war, we must dissociate ourselves from the old English and Indian authorities to the extent that they lay down a too general test of attainment of an object of general public nature or a political object. The Supreme Court expressed reservations in adopting this test in its literal sense and construing it in a manner out of tune with the present day. The court must be cautious in adopting an approach which has the effect of bringing within the fold of S.121 all acts of lawless and violent acts resulting in destruction of public properties, etc., and all acts of violent resistance to the armed personnel to achieve certain political objectives. The moment it is found that the object sought to be attained is of a general public nature or has a political hue, the offensive violent acts targeted against the armed forces and public oﬃcials should not be branded as acts of waging war. The expression \"waging war\" should not be stretched too far to hold that all the acts of disrupting public order and peace irrespective of their magnitude and repercussions could be reckoned as acts of waging war against the Government. A balanced and realistic approach is called for in construing the expression \"waging war\" irrespective of how it was viewed in the long past. An organised movement attended with violence and attacks against the public oﬃcials and armed forces while agitating for the repeal of an unpopular law or for preventing burdensome taxes were viewed as acts of treason in the form of levying war. We doubt whether such construction is in tune with the modern day perspectives and standards."

Terrorist acts can manifest themselves into acts of war. According to the learned Senior Counsel for the State, terrorist acts prompted by an intention to strike at the sovereign authority of the State/Government, tantamount to waging war irrespective of the number involved or the force employed. However, the degree of animus or intent and the magnitude of the acts done or attempted to be done would assume some relevance in order to consider whether the terrorist acts give rise to a state of war. Yet, the demarcating line is by no means clear, much less transparent. It is often a difference in degree. The distinction gets thinner if a comparison is made of terrorist acts with the acts aimed at overawing the Government by means of criminal force. Conspiracy to commit the latter offence is covered by section 121A.16. The incorporation of Chapter IV of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, shall not be viewed as deemed repeal of section 121 of the IPC, 1860. As explained in Navjot Sandhu (supra), a \"terrorist act\" and an act of \"waging war against the Government of India\" may have some overlapping features, but a terrorist act may not always be an act of waging war against the Government of India, and vice-versa.

It differs widely from attempt which is the direct movement towards the commission after preparations are made. Preparation to commit an offence is punishable only when the preparation is to commit offences under section 122 (waging war against the Government of India) and section 399 (preparation and an attempt is sometimes thin and has to be decided on the facts of each case).

In the present case, the accused was charged under section 121, IPC, 1860, for waging war against the Government of India or attempting to wage such war or abetting the   waging of such war. The concealment of such fact by an act or illegal omission with an intention to facilitate, or knowing that such concealment will facilitate, waging of war, even in the absence of proof of his involvement in waging of war against the Government of India, will constitute an offence and an accused can always be convicted for the concealment of such fact under section 123, IPC, 1860.

COMMENT— Unlawful assembly.—An 'assembly' is a company of persons assembled together in a place, usually for a common purpose. Court is concerned with an 'unlawful assembly'. Wherever ﬁve or more persons commit a crime with a common object and intent, then each of them would be liable for commission of such offence, in terms of sections 141 and 149, Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860). It is not possible to deﬁne the   constituents or dimensions of an offence under section 149 simpliciter with regard to dictionary meaning of the words 'unlawful assembly' or 'assembly'.2. An assembly of ﬁve or more persons having as its common object any of the ﬁve objects enumerated under section 1 41 of IPC is deemed to be an unlawful assembly. Membership of an unlawful assembly is itself an offence punishable under section.143, whereas other species of the said offence are dealt with under section 143–145 of IPC. Similarly, sections 146–148 of IPC deals with the offence of rioting which is deﬁned to be use of force or violence by any member thereof. Section 149 makes every member of an unlawful assembly liable for offence that may be committed by any member of the unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object of that assembly or for commission of any offence that the members of the assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of the common object of the assembly.3. To bring a case within section 149 of IPC some essential features must be present. First, there must be an existence of an unlawful assembly within the meaning of section 141 of IPC. This is a mixed question of fact and law.4. The underlying principle of section 141 is that law discourages tumultuous assemblage of men to preserve the public peace. Section 141 deﬁnes what an 'unlawful assembly' is. Section 142 gives the connotations of 'a member of an unlawful assembly'. Section 143 punishes tumultuous assemblies as they endanger public peace. It does not require that the purpose of the unlawful assembly should have been fulﬁlled. The essence of an offence under this section is the combination of ﬁve or more persons, united in the purpose of committing a criminal offence, and the consensus of purpose is itself an offence distinct from the criminal offence which these persons agree and intend to commit.5. Unlike the Indian law contained in section 141, IPC, 1860, an unlawful assembly at common law need to have only three or more persons who must assemble together for the common purpose of committing an offence involving use of violence, or for achieving a lawful or unlawful object in such a manner so as to lead to a reasonable apprehension of a breach of peace as a direct result of their conduct.6. Thus, under section 141, IPC, especially under sub-section (3) thereof, use of violence or likelihood of breach of the peace is not at all a sine qua non for an offence of unlawful assembly but this is so under the common law. So under the common law, even if the purpose of the assembly is unlawful, the offence of being an unlawful assembly would not be committed if there is no likelihood of breach of the peace and this would be so even if the unlawful common purpose is carried out.",

If ﬁve or more persons are named in the charge as forming an unlawful assembly and the evidence adduced by the prosecution proves that charge against all of them that is a very clear case where section 149 could be invoked. \"It is however not necessary that ﬁve or more persons must be convicted before a charge under section 149 could be successfully brought home to any members of the unlawful assembly. It may be that less than ﬁve persons may be charged and convicted under section 302 read with section 149, if the charge is that persons before the court along with others named, constituted an unlawful assembly. Other persons so named may not be available for trial along with their companions for the reason that they have absconded. In such a case, the fact that less than ﬁve persons are before the court does not make section 149 inapplicable. Therefore, in order to bring home a charge under section 149, it is not necessary that ﬁve or more persons must necessarily be brought before the court and convicted …\" In view of the decision of the Constitution Bench in Mohan Singh's case,10. even after acquittal of the two accused from all the charges levelled against them, if there is any material that they were members of the unlawful assembly, the conviction under section 302 can be based with the aid of section 149.11. Where two of the six accused persons were acquitted without any ﬁnding that some other known or unknown persons also were involved in the assault, the remaining four accused persons could not be said to be members of an unlawful assembly.12. Where a group of persons, differently armed, assaulted a man with the common object of killing him and all the assailants accused except one were acquitted, it was held that the remaining sole accused could not be convicted and sentenced under section 302 with the aid of section 149. The court cannot carve out a new case.13. If out of an unlawful assembly consisting of seven named persons four are acquitted, the other three cannot be convicted of rioting as members of an unlawful assembly.14. They may, however, be convicted of the principal offence with the aid of section 34, IPC, 1860.15. Where presence of eight persons in the course of assault was established, four of them were given beneﬁt of doubt but there was no ﬁnding anywhere to the effect that only   four persons had taken part in the assault, conviction of the remaining four on the charge of forming unlawful assembly was not illegal.16."

As pointed out by us above, the offence of mischief and trespass could also be as grave as that of an offence of murder, for which the punishment of life imprisonment can be imposed as provided for under Sections 438, 449, 450 etc. Therefore, we straight away hold that the argument of learned senior counsel for the Appellants to import the principle of 'ejusdem generis' to Section 141 'third', cannot be accepted.34."

It was argued that at any rate SOS was an unlawful assembly on account of the third clause of section 141 of IPC, 1860, and hence, all the discharged accused persons were members of the unlawful assembly and had to be at least charged and inquired into by the courts below. It was argued that the assembly of the police at least till the time they broke open the door was a lawful move, as it was their duty but they should not have broken open the door and trespassed the Suleman bakery; and all those who entered Suleman bakery formulated an unlawful assembly as they illegally trespassed into the Suleman bakery. Since A-1, Shri Tyagi, had ordered them to break open the doors and he was a part of that unlawful assembly who had the common object. The Supreme Court held that they were all the members of the SOS and had the duty to quell the riots. They were not doing anything illegal in coming out and trying to control the riots. Court rejected the argument by holding that a trespass becomes a criminal trespass if it is with an intention to annoy or to do something illegal which is not the case here.

This clause does not take away the right of private defence of property. It does not affect clause 2 of section 105, which allows a person to recover the property carried away by theft.

            "sub_section_description": "Section 142 shows that it is suﬃcient for the offence of riot to be proved against an individual that the individual should remain in an unlawful assembly as soon as he is aware that the assembly is unlawful. The word \"continues\" in the section means physical presence as a member of the unlawful assembly, that is, to be physically present in the crowd.44. This, however, should not be interpreted to mean that mere presence as a curious onlooker or bystander at the scene of the unlawful assembly without sharing its common object would make a person liable under section 142, IPC, 1860, for being a member of an unlawful assembly.45. Thus common object cannot be attributed to a person from his mere presence at the scene of the occurrence. There must be some other direct or circumstantial evidence to justify that inference.46. For being a member of unlawful assembly it is not necessary that a person must commit some overt act towards the commission of the crime. The test is whether he knows of its common object and continues to keep its company due to his own free will.47. Thus, where a large procession of Kannadigas, taken out to voice protest against Maharashtrians, turned violent, started pelting stones and attacking police oﬃcers; the procession turned into an unlawful assembly the moment it developed the common object of causing damage to property and injuries to police oﬃcers. Thereafter, every person who continued as a member of the assembly became liable for the offence committed by the processionalists by virtue of section 149 of IPC, 1860.48. If some unidentiﬁed members of an unlawful assembly behaved in an unruly manner, the other members in the procession cannot be held guilty of the offence by foisting vicarious liability, merely because they were in the procession.49."

COMMENT— Rioting.—A riot is an unlawful assembly in a particular state of activity, which activity is accompanied by the use of force or violence. It is only the use of force that distinguishes rioting from an unlawful assembly.54. Under the Common law when members of an unlawful assembly actually carry out their unlawful common purpose   with violence, so as to cause alarm, they are guilty of riot. For a successful prosecution of a riot case the prosecution must prove:— (i) that there were ﬁve or more persons; (ii) that they had a common purpose; (iii) that they had begun to execute such purpose; (iv) that they intended to help one another by force, if necessary; (v) that they had shown such degree of violence which would alarm at least one  person of reasonable courage. This last mentioned fact need not be proved by calling a person, who has been so alarmed but it may be made out from facts and circumstances of the case in hand.55.

In the Indian context in this very case the offence of rioting was complete the moment the youths used force to demolish the wall for it was not necessary in the Indian law to use force or violence against a person, far less to cause alarm to a person of reasonable courage and ﬁrmness.

But of course, if they are proved to have marched with the rioters for a long distance, when the rioters were shouting tell-tale slogans and pelting stones, it will be for them to prove their innocence under section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. (3) It will be very unsafe, in the case of such a large mob of rioters, to rely on the evidence of a single witness speaking to the presence of an accused in that mob for convicting him, especially when no overt act of violence, or shouting of slogan, or organising the mob, or giving orders to it or marching in procession with it, or other similar thing is proved against him. In a big riot by hundreds of persons, it is very easy even to mistake one person for another, and to implicate honestly really innocent   persons, and even, to mistake persons seen elsewhere as having been seen there. An ordinary rule of caution and prudence will require that an accused person identiﬁed only by one witness, and not proved to have done any overt act, etc., as described above, should be acquitted, by giving him the beneﬁt of the doubt. (4) Where there are acute factions based on either agrarian disputes and troubles or on political wrangling and rivalry or on caste divisions or on divisions of the \"haves\" and the \"have-nots,\" the greatest care must be exercised before believing the evidence of a particular witness belonging to one of these factions against an accused of the opposite view. This principle becomes of special importance when there are no overt acts, etc., proved, and when there are only one or two witnesses speaking to the presence of the accused among the rioters, and they belong to the classes or factions opposed to the accused. (5) Mere followers in rioting deserve a much more lenient sentence than leaders, who mislead them into such violent acts, by emotional appeals, slogans and cries.69."

COMMENT— Liability of every member.—The Supreme Court has held that this section does not create a separate offence but only declares the vicarious liability of all the members of   an unlawful assembly for acts done in prosecution of the common object of that assembly or for such offences as the members of the unlawful assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of that object.82. However, Benches of a smaller strength in some cases83. have observed that section 149 creates a speciﬁc and distinct offence. Thus the law declared therein by the Benches of a smaller strength cannot be taken as correct legal position.84. This section creates a speciﬁc and distinct offence.85. It is not the intention of the legislature in enacting section 149 to render every member of unlawful assembly liable to punishment for every offence committed by one or more of its members. In order to attract section 149, it must be shown that the incriminating act was done to accomplish the common object of unlawful assembly and it must be within the knowledge of other members as one likely to be committed in prosecution of the common object.86. A plain reading of the section shows that the provision is in two parts. The ﬁrst part deals with cases in which an offence is committed by any member of the assembly \"in prosecution of the common object\" of that assembly. The second part deals with cases where the commission of a given offence is not by itself the common object of the unlawful assembly but members of such assembly 'knew that the same is likely to be committed in prosecution of the common object of the assembly'.87. This section makes both the categories of persons, those who have committed the offence as also those who were members of the same assembly liable for the offences under section 149, IPC, 1860, provided the other requirements of the section are satisﬁed. That is to say, if an offence is committed by any person of an unlawful assembly, which the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed, every member of such an assembly is guilty of the offence. The law is clear that membership of unlawful assembly is suﬃcient to hold such participating members vicariously liable. For mulcting liability on the members of an unlawful assembly under section 149, it is not necessary that every member of the unlawful assembly should commit the offence in prosecution of the common object of the assembly. Mere knowledge of the likelihood of commission of such an offence by the members of the assembly is suﬃcient.88. Whenever the court convicts any person or persons of any offence with the aid of section 149, a clear ﬁnding regarding the common object of the assembly must be given and the evidence disclosed must show not only the nature of the common object but also that the object was unlawful. If members of the assembly knew or were aware of the likelihood of a particular offence being committed in prosecution of a common object, they would be liable for the same under section 149.89. In the absence of such ﬁnding as also any overt act on the part of the accused persons, mere fact that they were armed would not be suﬃcient to prove common object.90. Where the moot question as to common objective is proved all the members of unlawful assembly would be vicariously liable for the acts done by the said assembly and thus the separate roles played by all the accused persons need not be examined.91. Section 149 makes it abundantly clear that if an offence is committed by any member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object of that assembly, or such as the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of that object, every person who, at the time of the committing of that offence is a member of such an assembly, is guilty of that offence, however if a person is a mere bystander, and no speciﬁc role is attributed to him, he may not come under the wide sweep contemplated under section 149.92. Further where the member had no knowledge of the unlawful object of the assembly or after having gained knowledge, he attempted to prevent the assembly from accomplishing the unlawful object, and after having failed to do so, he disassociated himself from the assembly, the mere participation of him in such an assembly would not be made him liable.93. The section constitutes a substantive offence.94.   The Supreme Court reiterated the ambit and scope of this principle of liability as follows: Section 149 IPC provides for vicarious liability. If an offence is committed by any member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of a common object thereof or such as the members of that assembly knew that the offence was likely to be committed in prosecution of that object, every person who at the time of committing that offence was member would be guilty of the offence committed. The common object may be commission of one offence while there may be likelihood of commission of yet another offence, the knowledge whereof is capable of being safely attributable to the members of the unlawful assembly. Whether a member of such unlawful assembly was aware as regards likelihood of commission of another offence or not would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Background of the incident, the motive, the nature of the assembly, the nature of the arms carried by the members of the assembly, their common object and the behaviour of the members soon before, at or after the actual commission of the crime would be relevant factors for drawing an inference in that behalf.\"95. \"Common object\" means the purpose or design shared by all the members which may be formed at any stage. It has to be ascertained from the acts and conduct of the individuals concerned and surrounding circumstances.96. Common object to commit a murder cannot be inferred only on the basis that the weapons carried by the accused were dangerous.97.",

If an offence is committed by any member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of a common object thereof or such as the members of that assembly knew that the offence was likely to be committed in prosecution of that object, every person who at the time of committing that offence was member would be guilty of the offence committed. The common object may be commission of one offence while there may be likelihood of commission of yet another offence, the knowledge whereof is capable of being safely attributable to the members of the unlawful assembly. Whether a member of such unlawful assembly was aware as regards likelihood of commission of another offence or not would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Background of the incident, the motive, the nature of the assembly, the nature of the arms carried by the members of the assembly, their common object and the behaviour of the members soon before, at or after the actual commission of the crime would be relevant factors for drawing an inference in that behalf.\"95. \"Common object\" means the purpose or design shared by all the members which may be formed at any stage. It has to be ascertained from the acts and conduct of the individuals concerned and surrounding circumstances.96. Common object to commit a murder cannot be inferred only on the basis that the weapons carried by the accused were dangerous.97.",

Both sections deal with combinations of persons, who become punishable as sharers in an offence. Thus they have a certain resemblance and may to some extent overlap, but section 149 cannot at any rate relegate section 34 to the position of dealing only with joint action by the commission of identically similar criminal acts, a kind of case which is not in itself deserving of separate treatment at all\".102. Section 34 of IPC, 1860 refers to cases in which several persons both do an act and intend to do that act: it does not refer to cases where several persons intend to do an act and some one or more of them do an entirely different act. In the latter class of cases section 149 of the Code may be applicable but section 34 is not.103. On the other hand, if ﬁve or more persons both do an act and intend to do it, both section 34 and section 149, may apply, since the term \"member\" in the singular includes the plural also (section 9).

            "sub_section_description": "This section is not intended to subject a member of an unlawful assembly to punishment for every offence which is committed by one of its members during the time they are engaged in the prosecution of the common object. It is divided into two parts: (1) an offence committed by a member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object of that assembly; and (2) an offence such as the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of the common object of the unlawful assembly, is one which the accused knew would be likely to be committed in prosecution of the common object.104. The section applies equally in cases where offences are committed by single member of the assembly and in cases where offences are committed by two or more members of the assembly acting in furtherance of a common intention.105. Once the Court can ﬁnd that an offence has been committed by some member or members of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object, then whether the principal offender has been convicted for that offence or not, upon the plain wording of this section, the other members may be constructively convicted of that offence, provided they are found to have had the necessary intention or knowledge. It is not correct to say that when a member of an unlawful assembly is to be found constructively guilty of an offence under this section, it must be the same offence of which the principal is convicted and not some other offence.106. Members of an unlawful assembly may have a community of object only up to a certain point, beyond which they may differ in their objects, and the knowledge possessed by each member of what is likely to be committed in prosecution of their common object will vary, not only according to the information at his command, but also according to the extent to which he shares the community of object, and as a consequence of this the effect of this section may be different on different members of the same unlawful assembly.107. Before this section can be called in aid, the Court must ﬁnd with 'certainty' that there were at least ﬁve persons sharing the common object. A ﬁnding that three of them 'may or may not have been there' betrays uncertainty on this vital point and it consequently becomes impossible to allow the conviction to rest on this uncertain foundation. This is not to say that ﬁve persons must always be convicted before this section can be applied. It is possible in some cases for Judges to conclude that though ﬁve were unquestionably there the identity of one or more is in doubt. In that case, the conviction of the rest with the aid of this section would be good.108. Non-applicability   of section 149, IPC, 1860, is no bar in convicting the accused persons under section 302, IPC read with section 34 of IPC, if the evidence discloses commission of offence in furtherance of common intention of them all. It would depend on the facts of each case as to whether section 34 or section 149 of IPC or both the provisions are attracted.109. Where the accused, forming an unlawful assembly, chased and killed a man by inﬂicting multiple injuries on his body with sharp edged weapons, it was held that circumstances and transaction taken as a whole were suﬃcient to invoke section 34 or section 149.110. No judgment can be cited as a precedent however similar the facts may be. Each case must rest on its own facts.111. The persons acting in self-defence of property cannot be members of an unlawful assembly.112."

Membership of the 4 accused in the unlawful assembly and use of force with dangerous weapons is borne out by the evidence on record. The said facts would make the acquitted accused liable for the offence under section 148 of IPC, 1860.122. Where a small compact body of men armed with clubs, and headed by a man carrying a gun, endeavoured to take forcible possession of certain lands, and one of the opponents was shot by their leader, it was held that they were guilty of murder.123. Where in a faction- ridden village the members of one party seeing someone of the other party alighting from a bus emerged together to attack him, it could be easily said that they shared the common object to assault one of their enemies and at that stage the assembly turned into an unlawful assembly.124. Where several persons assaulted and caused injuries to the deceased, however except one incised injury on the head, all were lacerated injuries on legs, common object of the unlawful assembly was held to cause grievous hurt and not murder and conviction of the accused was altered from sections 302/ 149 to sections 326/149.125. Where the accused, being members of an unlawful assembly and being armed with sharp edged weapons, used only the blunt sides of their weapons, they were held to share the common object of causing grievous hurt and not murder.57 Accused persons variously armed entered a police wireless station after breaking open doors and windows and assaulted inmates. Their individual acts were not known. It was held that all the accused persons must be deemed to have shared the common object of lurking house trespass and could be convicted under sections 149/455.126. Where two innocent young girls were killed in a very gruesome manner just only to teach a lesson to their mother over a property dispute, every member of the killing team was held to be equally guilty deserving the maximum penalty of death, it being a case of the \"rarest of rare\" category.127. Where the death of a police oﬃcer was caused while he was arresting the accused and those who caught hold of him intended only to prevent him from performing his duty, but the main accused suddenly killed him, it was held that the common object of the unlawful assembly was to deter police from performing their duty and not to commit murder. Their conviction was altered from one under sections 302/149 to one under section   353/149.128. Several persons entered into a conspiracy to commit dacoity during the course of which one of the accused ﬁred a shot which missed the target and hit one of his accomplices who died.

This principle may not apply where the presence is such that merely by its reason the person concerned does not become a member of the assembly. This happened in a case in which the names of only 4 persons were mentioned in the complaint. Five other persons were not mentioned because they kept standing at the back without any participation in the incident. But they were also roped in under section 149. The Supreme Court held that they could not be regarded as members of the assembly. Their conviction was impermissible.135. Once a membership of an unlawful assembly is established it is not incumbent on the prosecution to establish whether any speciﬁc overt act has been assigned to any accused. Mere membership of the unlawful assembly is suﬃcient and every member is vicariously liable for the acts done by others either in the prosecution of the common   object of the unlawful assembly or such as the members of the unlawful assembly knew were likely to be committed.136."

            "sub_section_description": "section 302 read with section 149 of IPC, 1860: The Supreme Court in Nanak Chand v State of Punjab,152. considered the question whether there could be a conviction for the offence under section 302 simpliciter, when the charge was for the offence under section 302 read with section 149 of IPC. It was held that when there is no separate charge for the offence under section 302 simpliciter and charge is only for the offence under section 302 read with 149, the conviction for the offence under section 302 simpliciter is not sustainable. In Suraj Pal v State of UP,153. 19 accused were tried for the offences under sections 148, 307 and 302 read with section 149 of IPC. Sessions Court convicted all the accused. In appeal to the High Court, ten accused were acquitted. Conviction and sentence of one accused was aﬃrmed for the offence under sections 148, 307 and 302. Holding that absence of speciﬁc charges against the appellant under sections 307 and section 302, IPC in respect of which he was sentenced is a very serious lacuna as framing of a speciﬁc and distinct charge in respect of every distinct head of criminal liability constituting an offence is the foundation for a conviction and sentence. The question was referred to   the Five Judge Constitution Bench, to determine whether there was a conﬂict of view between Nanak Chand's case (supra) and Suraj Pal's case (supra) and if so to determine it in Willie Slaney v State of Madhya Pradesh.154. The Constitution Bench held that there was no conﬂict of views in the two decisions. It was held that the observations in Nanak Chand (supra), have to be appreciated on close examination of facts. Their Lordships considered the effect of a charge for constructive liability and its difference with a charge for the offence simpliciter and held that there was no prejudice and that the conviction is not invalid because of the nature of the charge. A three Judge Bench in Subran v State,155. held that when the charge is under section 302 read with section 149 of IPC, without a speciﬁc charge having been framed for the offence under section 302 of IPC, as envisaged in law, an accused cannot be convicted for the substantive offence under section 302 of IPC, their Lordships did not consider the Constitution Bench decision in Willie Slaney's case (supra). Later in the review judgment, Subran v State, 1993 (3) SCC 722 , their lordships reviewed the same as follows: On a review of the judgment, we ﬁnd that the opinion expressed is capable of being misinterpreted. The opinion expressed therein was required to be conﬁned to the peculiar facts of the case, but it tends to give an impression as if it is a general exposition of law, which it was not meant to be.  The legal position in the light of the Constitution Bench decision in Willie Slaney156. is clear. If the charge framed discloses the overt act committed by a particular accused, though the charge is for the offence under section 302 read with section 149 of IPC, 1860, and the accused faced trial with the knowledge that the prosecution case is that he committed the particular overt act which caused the death, non-framing of a distinct charge for the offence under section 302 will not cause prejudice to the accused, even though the charge framed was under section 302 read with section 149, IPC. In such a case, even though the charge is for the offence under section 302 read with section 149 of IPC and there is not even an alternate charge for the offence under section 302 simpliciter, when the charge discloses the overt act by a particular accused which caused the death of the victim, if the evidence establishes that, that particular accused inﬂicted that particular injury which caused the death, he could deﬁnitely be convicted for the offence under section 302 simpliciter. Even though there is no speciﬁc charge for section 302 simpliciter and the charge is for the offence under section 302 read with 149 of IPC, there could be a conviction under section 302 simpliciter."

COMMENT—   This section brings within the reach of the law those who are really the originators and instigators of the offences committed by hired persons. It deals with the case of those who are neither abettors of nor participators in the offence committed by an unlawful assembly. The section creates a speciﬁc offence. It intends to embrace all those who hire, promote or connive at the employment of persons and render them punishable as principal participators. Under the section, a person, though not actually a member of an unlawful assembly himself, may be held guilty of being a member of the assembly and may be held liable for the offence which may be committed by the assembly to the same extent as if he had himself committed that offence. But this is possible only when it is found that he hired or engaged or employed or promoted or connived at the hiring, engagement or employment by any other person to join or become a member of the assembly. There must have been an unlawful assembly which was composed of persons so hired, etc., and an offence committed in the course of that assembly for which he becomes equally liable.

It intends to embrace all those who hire, promote or connive at the employment of persons and render them punishable as principal participators. Under the section, a person, though not actually a member of an unlawful assembly himself, may be held guilty of being a member of the assembly and may be held liable for the offence which may be committed by the assembly to the same extent as if he had himself committed that offence. But this is possible only when it is found that he hired or engaged or employed or promoted or connived at the hiring, engagement or employment by any other person to join or become a member of the assembly. There must have been an unlawful assembly which was composed of persons so hired, etc., and an offence committed in the course of that assembly for which he becomes equally liable. The word \"promotes\" denotes acceleration or inducement. Though the word \"employ\" or \"employment\" is used, it does not mean recruitment. It would mean calling of the service of the hired person without any recruitment as a servant or agent to commit the offence.163.  163. Vinit v State of Maharashtra, 1994 Cr LJ 1791 at pp 1804–1805, certain persons, who  constituted an unlawful assembly, were hired to eliminate a particular person. The eliminators and their procurer were both held equally liable.   THE INDIAN PENAL CODE",

Explanation.—If the assembly is an unlawful assembly within the meaning of section 141, the offender will be punishable under section 145.  COMMENT—   Effect of command to disperse.—Section 145 punishes the continuance in an unlawful assembly after it has been commanded to disperse. In this section the assembly need not be an 'unlawful assembly' but if it is likely to cause a disturbance of the public peace, then joining or continuing in such assembly after it has been commanded to disperse is punishable. Section 129 of the Criminal Procedure Code confers on a Magistrate and an oﬃcer in charge of a police-station the power to disperse an unlawful assembly or any assembly of ﬁve or more persons likely to cause a disturbance of the public peace. A bare reading of section 129, Cr PC, 1973, would make it abundantly clear that a lawful procession or assembly cannot be regarded as likely to cause a breach of the peace when it is admitted that not they but some other body of persons is bent on attacking them. Whether an assembly is likely to cause a disturbance of public peace has to be judged from its own acts and behaviour and not from the behaviour of another hostile group whose physical opposition may cause a breach of the peace.164. \"Thus, if an assembly other than an unlawful assembly behaves in such a manner as to provoke a breach of the peace by its own conduct or action, there would be a justiﬁcation to order it to disperse under the powers given by section 129 of the Criminal Procedure Code. But if a religious assembly or procession remains peaceful in the enjoyment of its legitimate rights and privileges under the law, it should not be ordered to disperse merely because a body of antagonistic persons take it into their heads to attack it with a view to provoke a riot. In such a case, it is rather that body of aggressive persons that constitutes an unlawful assembly and requires to be sternly dealt with under the law\".165. So where a peaceful group of persons who were cutting crop on their own land refused to disperse on being commanded to do so by an Inspector of Police merely because another hostile group objected to the harvesting of the crop, it was held that as these persons were not commanded lawfully to disperse under section 129, Cr PC, 1973, they could not be convicted under section 151, IPC, 1860.166. In order to bring a case within the mischief of this section there must be clear evidence to show that the assembly had been \"lawfully commanded\" to disperse. Thus where the police oﬃcers in their evidence said that they had merely warned the two warring factions, it could not be said that the assembly had been commanded to disperse and as such there was no question of invoking section 151, IPC, to prosecute the members of the assembly.167.",

The indispensable ingredient of the offence is that the offender should have done the act \"being a public servant\". The next ingredient close to its heels is that such public servant has acted in disobedience of any legal direction concerning the way in which he should have conducted as such public servant. For the offences under sections 167 and 219 of IPC, 1860 the pivotal ingredient is the same as for the offence under section 166 of IPC, 1860.1. If in carrying out the direction of law the accused gave information which according to the complainant was untrue, that by itself cannot attract the offence punishable under section 166 IPC, 1860 unless it is shown that the replies given by the accused were untrue.2. Where an investigating oﬃcer recorded his satisfaction in writing that the search of a particular premises was necessary because disputed documents might be found there, his entry into such premises was held to be not in disobedience of law and therefore, he could not be prosecuted without sanction under section 197 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (CrPC, 1973).3. To make out an offence under this provision, it has to be stated that the public servant knowingly disobeyed any particular direction of the law which he was bound to obey and further that such disobedience would cause injury to any person to the knowledge of the public servant."

            "sub_section_description": "The allegation was that the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, Ms. Jayalalithaa, while holding the chief minister's post, had violated the code of conduct and purchased 3.0786 acres of land and buildings to the state-owned Tamil Nadu State Industries Corporation for Jaya Publications. While reversing the conviction passed by the High Court, the Supreme Court held that the offence under section 169 IPC, 1860 is incomplete without the assistance of some other enactment which imposes the legal prohibition required. Therefore, in order to come within the clutches of section 169 IPC, 1860, there should be a law which prohibits a public servant from purchasing certain property and if he does it, it becomes an offence under section 169 IPC, 1860. Section 481 of the Criminal Procedure Code, section 189 of the Railways Act, 1989 and section 19 of the Cattle Trespass Act, 1871 and instances of that nature in several enactments are available in which persons mentioned therein shall not directly or indirectly purchase any property at a sale under those Acts. Similarly section 136 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 provides that no Judge, legal practitioner, or oﬃcer connected with any Court of Justice shall buy or traﬃc in, or stipulate for, or agree to receive any share of, or interest in, any actionable claim and no Court of Justice shall enforce, at his instance, or at the instance of any person claiming by or through him, any actionable claims so dealt with by him as stated above. Thus, in these circumstances where a law has prohibited purchase of property or to bid at an auction, the prohibition contained therein will be attracted and will become an offence under section 169 IPC, 1860. The Code of Conduct not having a statutory force and not enforceable in a Court of law, nor having any sanction or procedure for dealing with a contravention thereof by the Chief Minister, cannot be construed to impose a legal prohibition against the purchase of property of the Government so as to give rise to a criminal offence under section 169 IPC, 1860.15."

COMMENT— Wearing garb or token of public servant.—Under this section the offence is complete, although no act is done or attempted in the assumed oﬃcial character. The mere circumstance of wearing a garb, or carrying a token, with the intention or knowledge supposed, is suﬃcient. It is not necessary that something should pass in words. If any act is done then the preceding section will apply. Under section 140 IPC, 1860, wearing the garb or carrying the token of a soldier is made punishable.    THE INDIAN PENAL CODE 1.[CHAPTER IX-A OF OFFENCES RELATING TO ELECTIONS  [s 171A] \"Candidate\", \"Electoral right\", deﬁned. For the purposes of this Chapter—",
        "section_comments": "Exercise of undue inﬂuence.—This section deﬁnes 'undue inﬂuence at elections'. Undue inﬂuence at an election is deﬁned as the voluntary interference or attempted interference with the right of any person to stand, or not to stand as, or withdraw from being, a candidate, or to vote or refrain from voting. This covers all threats of injury to person or property and all illegal methods of persuasion and any interference with the liberty of the candidates or the electors. The inducing or attempting to induce a person to believe that he will become the object of divine displeasure is also interference.10. Where an attempt or threat is proved, it is unnecessary to prove that any person was in fact prevented from voting because the offence is complete. The expression 'free exercise of his electoral right' does not mean that a voter is not to be inﬂuenced. This expression has to be read in the context of an election in a democratic society and the candidates and their supporters must naturally be allowed to canvass support by all legal and legitimate means. This exercise of the right by the candidate or his supporters to canvass support does not interfere or attempt to interfere with the free exercise of an electoral right.11. The Supreme Court has accepted the proposition that something more than a mere act of canvassing would be necessary and that something more is speciﬁed in clauses (a) and (b) of the section. Applying this to the facts, the court laid down that the appeal, even if true, of the Chairman of the Minorities Commission who happened to be the retired judge of the   Supreme Court, to the voters to cast their votes in favour of a particular candidate [who was returned], does not make out the offence enumerated in this section.12. A message sent to the secretary of a party to boycott the election does not amount to interference within the meaning of this section as members of the party are still free to vote as they like.13.  [s 171C.1] CASES.— A candidate informed the voters that he was Chalanti Vishnu and representative of Lord Jagannath himself and that any person who did not vote for him would be a sinner against the Lord and the Hindu religion; it was held that such propaganda would amount to an offence under section 171F read with this section.14. The statement was made by a member of the ruling party to the Republican party of India (RPI) that if it supported the alliance in parliamentary elections, the latter would make one member of the RPI as Deputy Chief Minister of State. It was held that this did not amount to giving offer to any individual for inducing him to exercise his electoral right in a particular manner.15.",

Omission to mention about a two-wheeler in the statement of assets and liabilities by a public servant is not an offence under section 177 IPC, 1860.45. It is clear that the accused having been aware of the fact that she belongs to \"Havyak Brahmin\" by caste, furnished false information to the authority and obtained admission by producing false caste certiﬁcate. The ingredients of section 177 are proved.46. In a case where the allegation was that the complainant ﬁled false information in nomination paper, it was held that a complaint by the Returning oﬃcer is mandatory.47. The appellant being a Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat was legally bound to give correct information and issue a correct certiﬁcate but he issued a false certiﬁcate in favour of one Lal Chand that he does not own any land except the land which he has made ﬁt for cultivation, in fact, though Lal Chand owned 13 kanals, 13 marlas and also his wife owned lands in the village Baruhi.

If a person gives false answers, then he will be guilty under section 193 and not under this section.

This section also applies to the accused as the words used in section 161(1) Cr PC, 1973, are \"any person acquainted with facts and circumstances of the case\". Thus, the accused too is bound to answer a question put by a police-oﬃcer in course of his examination. However, the answer to a question has a tendency to incriminate him; he can claim protection under Article 20(3) of the Constitution and refuse to answer. Of course, it is a matter which has to be ultimately decided by the Court.53. The matter is entirely different so far the oﬃcers of the Railway Protection Force are concerned ﬁrst, they are not police-oﬃcers54. and second, the enquiry conducted by them under sections 8 and 9 of the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966 is not a police investigation but should be deemed to be a judicial proceeding.55. Section 9 of this special Act speciﬁcally lays down that during such enquiry by an RPF oﬃcer, persons summoned have to obey summons and state the truth and, therefore, by refusing to answer, such persons would make themselves liable under section 179, IPC, 1860. The question of invoking Article 20(3) of the Constitution does not arise in such a case, as till the complaint is ﬁled under section 190(1)(a), Cr PC, 1973 by the RPF oﬃcer, a person cannot be regarded as \"accused of an offence\" within the meaning of Article 20(3) of the Constitution.56.",

COMMENT— This section makes it penal to offer resistance to the taking of property by the lawful authority of any public servant. The Bombay High Court has held that there are no words in the section as there are in section 99, extending the operation of the section to acts which are not strictly justiﬁable by law. Resistance to an act of a public oﬃcer acting bona ﬁde though in excess of his authority may give rise to some charge in the nature of assault, but it cannot afford any foundation for a prosecution under this section.90. The Madras High Court is of opinion that this section should be read in conjunction with section 99. Taking the two together, if an oﬃcer acts in good faith under colour of his oﬃce the mere circumstance that his \"act may not be strictly justiﬁable by law\" cannot affect the lawfulness of his authority. In this case, property had been seized in execution by the oﬃcer of the Court, and it was held that as the oﬃcer was acting bona ﬁde, though he had wrongly seized the property of the accused, the accused could be convicted under this section for resisting the execution.91. This view of the law receives substantial support from the decision of the Supreme Court in Keshoram's case92. where too it has been held that merely because no prior notice was served on the accused before seizing his cattle under the Delhi Municipal Act for recovering arrears of milk tax, it could not be said that the municipal oﬃcer's action was entirely illegal and as such the accused had the right of private defence against the bona ﬁde act of the public servant. In the instant case the accused was held to have been rightly convicted under sections 353/332/333, IPC, 1860, for assaulting the public servant.

The Bombay High Court has held that there are no words in the section as there are in section 99, extending the operation of the section to acts which are not strictly justiﬁable by law. Resistance to an act of a public oﬃcer acting bona ﬁde though in excess of his authority may give rise to some charge in the nature of assault, but it cannot afford any foundation for a prosecution under this section.90. The Madras High Court is of opinion that this section should be read in conjunction with section 99. Taking the two together, if an oﬃcer acts in good faith under colour of his oﬃce the mere circumstance that his \"act may not be strictly justiﬁable by law\" cannot affect the lawfulness of his authority. In this case, property had been seized in execution by the oﬃcer of the Court, and it was held that as the oﬃcer was acting bona ﬁde, though he had wrongly seized the property of the accused, the accused could be convicted under this section for resisting the execution.91. This view of the law receives substantial support from the decision of the Supreme Court in Keshoram's case92. where too it has been held that merely because no prior notice was served on the accused before seizing his cattle under the Delhi Municipal Act for recovering arrears of milk tax, it could not be said that the municipal oﬃcer's action was entirely illegal and as such the accused had the right of private defence against the bona ﬁde act of the public servant. In the instant case the accused was held to have been rightly convicted under sections 353/332/333, IPC, 1860, for assaulting the public servant. On a parity of reasoning it can be said that had the accused been prosecuted under section 183 of the Code, he could have also been convicted under that section as well.",

The daughter of the tenant of the accused died of electrocution. The police-oﬃcers entered the premises with permission to check fresh wiring and leakage of current.

Explanation.—It is not necessary that the offender should intend to produce harm, or contemplate his disobedience as likely to produce harm. It is suﬃcient that he knows of the order which he disobeys, and that his disobedience produces, or is likely to produce, harm. ILLUSTRATION An order is promulgated by a public servant lawfully empowered to promulgate such order, directing that a religious procession shall not pass down a certain street. A knowingly disobeys the order, and thereby causes danger of riot. A has committed the offence deﬁned in this section.  COMMENT— Ingredients.—To constitute this offence it is necessary to show— (1) a lawful order promulgated by a public servant empowered to promulgate it; (2) knowledge of the order which may be general or special; (3) disobedience of such order; and (4) the result that is likely to follow from such disobedience.   The offence under this section has now been made a cognizable offence under the Cr PC, 1973. Though a bailable offence, it can be made non-bailable by a notiﬁcation by the State Government under section 10(2) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1932.

Mere proof of a general notiﬁcation promulgating the order does not satisfy the requirements of the section.114. \"Promulgation\" does not require publication in newspapers or by posters.115. Mere disobedience of an order does not constitute an offence in itself; it must be shown that the disobedience has or tends to a certain consequence,116. namely, annoyance, obstruction, etc. The annoyance has to be proved as a fact; mere mental annoyance of the authorities concerned is not enough.117. It is also necessary to see that the order was not only lawfully made but duly promulgated and the accused had knowledge of the order, else his conviction cannot be sustained.118. Where a standing crop was attached by means of an order under section 145 Cr PC, 1973 and the accused, who had come to know the order, reaped and removed the crop, an offence under this section was held to have been committed.

State Amendment Andhra Pradesh.— In Andhra Pradesh offence under section 189 is cognizable. [Vide A.P.G.O. Ms. No. 732, dated 5th December, 1991].  COMMENT— Under this section there must be a threat of injury either to the public servant or to any one in whom the accused believes the public servant to be interested. What the section deals with are menaces which would have a tendency to induce the public servant to alter his action. See section 503 which deﬁnes criminal intimidation and applies in all cases. This section deals with criminal intimidation of a public servant. Threats of violence to a public servant who accepted bribe money but did not do the promised work are not covered by this section. A public servant deserves protection, since in the performance of his duties, he is likely to cause disappointment to many and invite their wrath. That is why under sections 189 and 353 and various other sections of the IPC, 1860, a public servant is strongly protected and punishment for offences against him is made deterrent. However if a public servant has gone astray and indulged in malpractices, more especially by way of taking bribe, he would necessarily become subject to public criticism and private accountability. What appears then at the forefront is not the performance of duty by the public servant, but the non-performance of some contract dehors the normal functions of the public servant. If that illegal contract gives rise to any act of violence at any stage, such acts cannot constitute by any stretch of imagination acts contemplated and punished under sections 353 and 189, IPC, 1860.128. Where workers of Communist Party (Marxist) went to a police station to protest against the arrest of their party workers and in the process asked the police-oﬃcer to release them on threat of dire consequences, it was held that the accused had committed an offence under this section.129. By a notiﬁcation under section 10 of the   Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1932, the State Government can make this section a cognizable offence for a speciﬁed area.",

What appears then at the forefront is not the performance of duty by the public servant, but the non-performance of some contract dehors the normal functions of the public servant. If that illegal contract gives rise to any act of violence at any stage, such acts cannot constitute by any stretch of imagination acts contemplated and punished under sections 353 and 189, IPC, 1860.128. Where workers of Communist Party (Marxist) went to a police station to protest against the arrest of their party workers and in the process asked the police-oﬃcer to release them on threat of dire consequences, it was held that the accused had committed an offence under this section.129. By a notiﬁcation under section 10 of the   Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1932, the State Government can make this section a cognizable offence for a speciﬁed area.  128.

Explanation 1.—A statement is within the meaning of this section, whether it is made verbally or otherwise. Explanation 2.—A false statement as to the belief of the person attesting is within the meaning of this section, and a person may be guilty of giving false evidence by stating that he believes a thing which he does not believe, as well as by stating that he knows a thing which he does not know. ILLUSTRATIONS (a) A, in support of a just claim which B has against Z for one thousand rupees,  falsely swears on a trial that he heard Z admit the justice of B's claim. A has given false evidence. (b) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he believes a certain   signature to be the handwriting of Z, when he does not believe it to be the handwriting of Z. Here A states that which he knows to be false, and therefore gives false evidence. (c) A, knowing the general character of Z's handwriting, states that he believes a  certain signature to be the handwriting of Z; A in good faith believing it to be so. Here A's statement is merely as to his belief, and is true as to his belief, and therefore, although the signature may not be the handwriting of Z, A has not given false evidence. (d) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he knows that Z was at  a particular place on a particular day, not knowing anything upon the subject. A gives false evidence whether Z was at that place on the day named or not. (e) A, an interpreter or translator, gives or certiﬁes as a true interpretation or  translation of a statement or document which he is bound by oath to interpret or translate truly, that which is not and which he does not believe to be a true interpretation or translation. A has given false evidence.",

In India a prosecution for perjury seems to be possible in such a case by virtue of illustration (e) of section 221, The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, it has been held to be inexpedient to do so in the interest of justice. Thus, where a person made one statement under section 164 Cr PC, 1973 and a diametrically opposite statement in Court during the enquiry or trial, he could in view of this illustration be charged in the   alternative and convicted of intentionally giving false evidence, although it cannot be proved which of these contradictory statements was false. But to do so may be to tie him down to his previous false statement under section 164 Cr PC, 1973, and preventing him from telling the truth even belatedly at the later stage of enquiry or trial. The Supreme Court too has felt that a witness whose statement has been recorded under section 164 Cr PC, 1973, feels tied to his previous statement and as such his evidence has to be approached with caution.17. In the instant case as it could not be shown that the earlier statements of the witnesses recorded under section 164 Cr PC, 1973 were true and those given before the Magistrate in course of the enquiry were false, the complaints of perjury ﬁled against the witnesses were directed to be withdrawn.18."

During the examination, the Court insisted him to give a deﬁnite opinion that too without examining the ﬁrearm. At that time, he opined that the cartridges appeared to have been ﬁred from two separate ﬁrearms. Considering that there was a deliberate deviation in his opinion the High Court initiated proceedings against him under section 340 Cr PC, 1973 for perjury.

It is the offence of giving false evidence or of fabricating false evidence for the purpose of being used in a judicial proceeding.33.

The ﬁrst paragraph applies only to cases in which the false evidence is given in a judicial proceeding, the second to all other cases. If the offence is committed in any stage of a judicial proceeding it is more severely punishable than when it is committed in a nonjudicial proceeding. Intention is the essential ingredient in the constitution of this offence. If the statement was false, and known or believed by the accused to be false, it may be presumed that in making that statement he intentionally gave false evidence. In order to make a person liable for perjury it is necessary that he should have made a statement on oath regarding the facts on which his statement was based and then deny those facts on oath on a subsequent occasion.68. The mere fact that a deponent has made contradictory statements at two different stages in a judicial proceeding is not by itself always suﬃcient to justify a prosecution for perjury under section 193 but it must be established that the deponent has intentionally given false statement in any stage of the 'judicial proceeding' or fabricated false evidence for the purpose of being used in any stage of the 'judicial proceeding'.69. It is not necessary that the false statement should be material to the case. The gist of the offence is the giving or fabrication of false evidence intentionally. Where knowledge of falsity is proved, intention is readily presumed.70.",

But, if the commission of the main offence is not brought home to the accused, then he can be convicted under this section.134. Where it is impossible to say deﬁnitely that a person has committed the principal offence he cannot escape conviction under this section merely because there are grounds for suspicion that he might be the principal culprit.135. A woman's husband and in-laws could not be convicted of murdering her because there was no evidence whatsoever. They were convicted under this section because they gave no reasonable explanation of the unnatural death and had also disposed of the body in suspicious circumstances (dead body found near railway track).136. The fact that the accused persons cannot be convicted for offence punishable under section 302 IPC, 1860 does not extricate them from the offence under section 201 IPC, 1860.137. In a case of bride burning, where the post-mortem report was that death was due to throttling, burning her subsequently was held to be a clear proof of the fact that the evidence of strangulation was sought to be destroyed by the accused husband by pouring kerosene and setting her ablaze. The conviction of the husband under sections 201, 302 and 498-A was held to be proper.138. A statement given by a person in the course of an investigation by the police cannot amount to an offence under this section and section 203, even if it ultimately turns out to be false.139. The allegation against the appellant was that, he had deliberately shielded the real offenders in the murder case and was accordingly liable for the offence under section 201 of the IPC, 1860. Supreme Court acquitted the accused   holding that it is not possible on the evidence to ascertain, as to whether the appellant was, in fact, guilty of the offence alleged against him.140. The Supreme Court has held that where the evidence showed that a person had died and his body was found in a trunk and discovered in a well, and that the accused had taken part in the disposal of the body but there was no evidence to show the cause of his death, or the manner or circumstances in which it came about, it was held that the accused could not be convicted for an offence under this section.141.

The Court, however, pointed out that such cases are likely to be very small in number. Applying this to the facts of the case, the Court held that the accused was guilty of offence under this section because he had buried the dead body of his wife in his ﬁeld and misguided the police of her disappearance, though, because of decomposition, it could not be proved that he was responsible for her death.144."

(2) Preferring a false charge against a person.  The ﬁrst assumes the second, but the second may be committed where no criminal proceedings follow. The necessary ingredients to constitute either of the above offences are— (1) the criminal proceedings must be instituted, or the false charge made with  intent to injure; (2) the criminal proceedings must be instituted, or the false charge must be made,  without just or lawful ground, in other words, it must be made maliciously. Difference is made in punishment according as the charge relates to offences punishable with imprisonment which may extend to seven years or more or otherwise. The mere making of a false charge is punishable under the ﬁrst part of the section. If a case gets no further than a police inquiry, it falls within that part. But under the second part there should be an actual institution of criminal proceedings on a false charge.225. Two conditions are necessary before the enhanced punishment provided in the second paragraph could be inﬂicted: (1) proceedings on the false charge should have been actually instituted, and (2) the false charge must be in respect of an offence punishable with death, imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for seven years or upwards.",

            "sub_section_name": "Sections 182 and 211.—",
            "sub_section_description": "According to the Bombay High Court there is a clear distinction between a false charge that falls under section 211 and false information given to the police, in which latter case the offence falls under section 182. A person prosecuting another under section 182 need not prove malice and want of reasonable and probable cause except so far as they are implied in the act of giving information known to be false, with the knowledge or likelihood that such information would lead a public servant to use his power to the injury or annoyance of the complainant. In an inquiry under section 211, on the other hand, proof of the absence of just and lawful ground for making the charge is an important element.226. If the information conveyed to the police amounts to the institution of criminal proceedings against a deﬁned person or amounts to the falsely charging of a deﬁned person with an offence, then the person giving such information is guilty of an offence under section 211. In such a case, section 211 is, and section 182 is not, the appropriate section under which to frame a charge. Section 182, when read with section 211, must be understood as referring to cases where the information given to the public servant falls short of amounting to institution of criminal proceedings against a deﬁned person and falls short of amounting to the falsely charging of a deﬁned person with an offence as deﬁned in the Penal Code.227. The Calcutta, the Madras, the Allahabad and the Patna High Courts differ from this view of the Bombay High Court. The Calcutta High Court has ruled that a prosecution for a false charge may be under section 182 or section 211, but if the false charge was a serious one, the graver section 211 should be applied and the trial should be full and fair.228. Where a false charge is made to the police of a cognizable offence the offence committed by the person making the charge falls within the meaning of section 211 and not section 182.229. The Madras High Court has held that there is no error in a conviction under section 182, when the false charge made before the police was punishable under the ﬁnal clause of section 211. The High Court may quash the conviction and sentence for the minor offence and direct a trial before a tribunal having jurisdiction for the graver offence.   Whether it will do so, or not, is a question, not of law, but of expediency on the facts of the particular case.230. The Allahabad High Court had held that where a speciﬁc false charge is made, the proper section, for proceedings to be adopted under section 211.231. Although it is diﬃcult to see what case would arise under section 211 to which section 182 could not be applied yet section 182 would apply to a case that might not fall under section 211. The offence under section 182 is complete when false information is given to a public servant by a person who believes it to be false, but who intends thereby to cause such public servant to institute criminal proceedings against a third person. The offence is complete although the public servant takes no steps towards the institution of such criminal proceedings. There is no restriction imposed by the Penal Code or by the Criminal Procedure Code upon the prosecution of an offence either under section 182 or section 211. It appears that it has been left to the discretion of the Court to determine when and under what circumstances prosecution should be proceeded with under sections 182 and 211.232. The soundness of this view is doubted in subsequent cases.233. The Patna High Court has followed the view of the Calcutta High Court.234. The Lahore High Court has held that an offence under section 182 is included in the more serious offence under section 211 and a prosecution for a false charge may be either under section 182 or section 211, though clearly if section 211 does apply and the false charge is serious, the prosecution should be under section 211.235."

The word \"offender\" is not deﬁned under IPC, 1860. \"Offender\" as per the Dictionary, means \"a person who has committed a crime or offence.\" Hence, a person who is convicted or acquitted may be an offender, for the purpose of section 212. An \"offender\" for the purpose of section 212 is neither a convict nor an accused, but he is a person who has actually committed the offence. The failure of the prosecution to prove the identity of the person who committed the offence does not render the person, who committed the offence, not an offender. He can be said to be an offender whose guilt has not been proved in Court. Yet, he is an offender, if he has committed an offence.281. This section applies to the harbouring of persons who have actually committed some offence under the Penal Code or an offence under some special or local law, when the thing punishable under such special or local law is punishable with imprisonment for a term of six months or upwards. It does not apply to the harbouring of persons, not being criminals, who merely abscond to avoid or delay a judicial investigation.282. Where there was no material to show that the accused had the knowledge or that he reasonably believed that he was harbouring or concealing a person who was an   offender and the essential feature of secrecy was totally absent, it was held that no offence under section 212 was made out.283. It is the knowledge or the reasonable belief of the accused under section.212 that the person whom, he has harboured or concealed to be the offender, which is relevant. But, such knowledge or belief must be entertained by the accused, on the date on which he commits the offence by harbouring or concealing him.284. In the conspiracy for assassination of the former Prime Minister of India (Mr. Rajiv Gandhi), some of the accused persons appeared at the scene after achievement of the object. They played the role of harbouring and sheltering the main accused persons with full knowledge of their involvement in the assassination. They also made efforts to destroy evidence.

This section deals with harbouring an offender who has escaped from custody after being actually convicted or charged with the offence, or whose apprehension has been ordered; the latter offence is in the eye of the law more aggravated, and a heavier punishment is, therefore, awarded for it.

No provision is made for cases where he is wanted for offences for which the maximum sentence is less than one year.309.

Since the check post oﬃcer appointed under section 41(2) Bihar Sales Tax Act had no power to detain personnel or driver of a truck which contravened the provisions of the Act, he could not be prosecuted for an offence under section 223, IPC, 1860, for allowing detained person to escape especially because section 223 speaks of \"conﬁnement of persons charged with or convicted of any offence or lawfully committed to custody\". Even assuming that such a check post oﬃcer could detain a person, still he could not be prosecuted as detention was not synonymous with conﬁnement nor the persons escaping were charged or convicted of any offence.350. A constable who moved about in a market place with the prisoner whom he was supposed to bring to the Court and he escaped, the case was held to be ﬁt one for imposing substantive punishment.351. This section applies only to cases where the person who is allowed to escape is in custody for an offence, or has been committed to custody, and not to cases where such person has merely been arrested under a civil process.352. The latter case would come under section 225A. Due to the negligence and carelessness of the police constable one accused escaped from police lock-up. It is proved that the petitioner was on duty at lock-up room when the accused escaped. Conviction is held proper.353."

        "section_comments": "Persons who offer resistance or illegal obstruction to the apprehension of other persons who have committed offences are punishable under this section. The preceding section punishes the offenders themselves. Section 130 deals with rescuing a prisoner of State or war and section 186, with rescuing in any other case. 'Rescue' is the act of forcibly freeing a person from custody against the will of those who have him in custody.366. It has no application to a person who is in lawful custody and who has offered no resistance or obstruction.367. It is also not necessary that the rescuing should be done intentionally for in the second part of this section the word \"intentionally\" has been deliberately omitted. Thus where a person even in order to pacify a situation released an accused from the lawful custody of the chowkidar by untying the turban with which the accused had been tied, it was held that the person so releasing the accused was clearly guilty of an offence under section 225, IPC, 1860, for rescuing an offender from lawful custody.368. One can be held guilty for an offence under section 225 if he rescues a person who was detained lawfully. Here the word 'rescue' though not deﬁned in the Code, will always mean an act of getting a person free forcibly from custody against the will of person in whose lawful custody he was. Therefore, some overt act needs to be there, if one is said to have rescued a person from the lawful custody.369. Where the accused obstructed the lawful apprehension of a person and wrongfully conﬁned two police personnel and the evidence of the prosecution was amply corroborated and supported by medical evidence, conviction and sentence of the accused under sections 225, 332 and 342 was upheld.370. The act for which the person rescued is detained must amount to an offence under the Code. Thus an escape from custody when being taken before a Magistrate for the purpose of being bound over to be of good behaviour,371. or an escape from arrest under section 41(2), Criminal Procedure Code,372. will not fall under this section. If the apprehension is not lawful the person resisting it will not be guilty of any offence.373.",

As deﬁned in section 268 Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860) public nuisance is an offence against public either by doing a thing which tends to the annoyance of the whole community in general or by neglect to do anything which the common good requires. On the alternative it causes injury, obstruction, danger or annoyance to persons who may have   occasion to use public right. It is the quantum of annoyance or discomfort in contra distinction to private nuisance which affects an individual is the decisive factor.1. Nuisance is of two kinds: (1) public and (2) private. (1) Public nuisance or common nuisance is an offence against the public either by doing a thing, which tends to the annoyance of the whole community in general, or by neglecting to do anything that the common good requires. It is an act affecting the public at large, or some considerable portion of them and it must interfere with rights, which members of the community might otherwise enjoy. It is not a sine qua non that the annoyance should injuriously affect every member of the public within its range of operation. It is suﬃcient that it should affect people in general who dwell in the vicinity.2. As to when an individual can bring a civil action in respect of a public nuisance, see the authors' Law of Torts, 19th Edn, chapter XXI. (2) Private nuisance is deﬁned to be anything done to the hurt or annoyance of the lands, tenements or hereditaments of another, and not amounting to trespass. It is an act affecting some particular individual or individuals as distinguished from the public at large. It is in the quantum of annoyance that private nuisance differs from public.

Welfare of the society is the primary duty of every civilised State. Section 269, IPC, 1860 makes the negligent act likely to spread infection or disease dangerous to life as an offence. The essential ingredients are: (1) that the accused does any act unlawfully or negligently; that such act is likely to  spread infection of any disease dangerous to life; and (2) that he knows or had reasons to believe that the act is likely to cause such  infection.   Thus causing infection of the disease, which is dangerous to life, is covered by this section.8. The expression \"reason to believe\" has been deﬁned under section 26 IPC, 1860 and it lays down that a person said to have \"reason to believe\" a thing, if he has suﬃcient cause to believe that thing but not otherwise.

The word \"noxious\" as stated in Advanced Law Lexicon by P Ramanatha Aiyar (3rd Edition Reprint 2009), when used in relation to article of food is to mean that the article is poisonous, harmful to health or repugnant to human use. Having regard to language used in section 273, noxious food or drink, literally would mean article of food or drink which earlier was not noxious, but should have become noxious or had been rendered noxious by lapse of time or by not taking proper precaution or for not adding preservatives or the like.23. What is punishable under this section is the sale of noxious articles as food or drink and not the mere sale of noxious article. Where the owner of a grain pit sold the contents of it before it was opened at a certain sum per maund whether the grain was good or bad, and on the pit being opened it was found that a large proportion of the grain was unﬁt for human consumption, it was held that the vendor could not be convicted under this section.24. Similarly, the selling of wheat containing a large admixture of extraneous matter, such as dirt, wood, matches, charcoal, was held to constitute no offence.25.

Second, to avoid hardship in cases where the claimant is able to prove the accident but cannot prove how the accident occurred. The Courts have also applied the principle of res ipsa loquitur in cases where no direct evidence was brought on record. Elements of this doctrine may be stated as: (a) The event would not have occurred but for someone's negligence. (b) The evidence on record rules out the possibility that actions of the victim or some third party could be the reason behind the event. (c) Accused was negligent and owed a duty of care towards the victim.40. The principle of res ipsa loquitur is only a rule of evidence to determine the onus of proof in actions relating to negligence.41. This doctrine operates in the domain of civil law especially in the cases of torts and helps in determining the onus of proof in actions relating to negligence. It cannot be pressed 'in service for determining per se the liability for negligence within the domain of criminal law. Res ipsa loquitur has, if at all, a limited application in trial on a charge of criminal negligence.42. Where a vehicle was being driven on a wrong side, accident resulting in the death of two persons, the principle of res ipsa loquitur should have been applied.43. In the case of Thakur Singh v State of Punjab,44. the accused drove a bus rashly and negligently with 41 passengers and while crossing a bridge, the bus fell into the nearby canal resulting in death of all the passengers. The Court applied the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur since admittedly the petitioner was driving the bus at the relevant time and it was going over the bridge when it fell down."

But the evidence showed that vehicle was going in middle of road and child was also playing on road. Brake skid marks on road were duly depicted in site plan, acquittal was held proper by the High Court.55. Where a tractor driver was driving the tractor at a speed of six miles per hour at night and a man who was sitting on it in a careless fashion unmindful of bumps and jolts fell down and died, it was held that the driver was not guilty of any rash or negligent act within the meaning of sections 279 and 304A, IPC, 1860.56. Where a truck dashed against a cyclist and a cart resulting in injuries to both the cyclist and the cartman but there was no evidence to the actual dashing of the   truck against the cyclist and the cart and no evidence was either available about the mechanical ﬁtness or otherwise of the truck as the same had been set on ﬁre by an angry mob, it could not be presumed that the truck must have been driven rashly and negligently merely because two persons were injured. In the circumstances, the conviction of the accused under sections 279 and 304A, IPC, 1860 was set aside.57. Merely because the driver ran away from the spot immediately after the incident, it could not be said that he must have been driving rashly and negligently.58. Driving at a high speed or non-sounding of horn by itself does not mean that the driver is rash or negligent. Place, time, traﬃc and crowd are important factors to determine rashness or negligence.59. High speed at a crowded road and pressing a person against a wall in order to save accident was held to be negligence within the meaning of this section.60. To drive at a high speed on an empty road or at a lonely place is not the same thing as driving in a crowded city street.61. Crushing a school child while driving past a school was held to be ipso facto rashness. Everybody is expected to slow down and take extra precautions near the vicinity of an educational institution.62. The mere fact that there are more than two persons in a two-wheeled vehicle will not make out an offence under section 279, IPC, 1860 as it by itself does not amount to so rash and negligent an act as to endanger human life, section 279, IPC, 1860 is not attracted where the driving is ordinarily rash or negligent. Moreover, if an offence is really made out, then driver alone is responsible and not the pillion rider or riders. Therefore, the police practice of apprehending all occupants of the vehicle is deprecated.63."

Where the accused dashed the jeep against a tree, as a result of which one person, who was travelling in the jeep got injured and died, and another person, who was also in the same vehicle received injuries, the Supreme Court held that the High Court, without proper appreciation of the evidence and consideration of the gravity of the offence, showed undue sympathy by reducing the sentence.73."

But where repetitive photographs without any backdrop content are published in a magazine and nearly l/4th of the magazine consists of nothing but repetitive photographs of semi-nude women, prominence being to display their breast, there being hardly any literary contents in the magazine, the matter loses any literary content and therefore the broad social outlook penned in Ranjit Udeshi's case127. may not be available as a defence.128. To fall within the scope of 'obscene' under sections 292 and 294 IPC, the ingredients of the impugned matter/art must lie at the extreme end of the spectrum of the offensive matter. The legal test of obscenity is satisﬁed only when the impugned art/matter can be said to appeal to an unhealthy, inordinate person having perverted interest in sexual matters or having a tendency to morally corrupt and debase persons likely to come in contact with the impugned art.129."

As per this, the test of obscenity is whether the tendency of the matter charged as obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral inﬂuences and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall. The other test is Community Standard Test, whereby the obscenity has to be judged from the point of view of an average person, by applying contemporary community standards. In Aveek Sarkar v State of WB,131. the Supreme Court was of the view that Hicklin test is not the correct test to be applied to determine \"what is obscenity\". When the name of Mahatma Gandhi is alluded or used as a symbol, speaking or using obscene words, the concept of \"degree\" comes in. To elaborate, the \"contemporary   community standards test\" becomes applicable with more vigour, in a greater degree and in an accentuated manner.132."

Mere possession of an obscene cassette by itself does not amount to an offence punishable under section 292(2) IPC. In the case on hand, the accused was found managing a video shop wherein obscene cassette containing a blue-ﬁlm evidently kept for hire to the potential customers, was found. In such circumstances, it cannot be said that the possession of the cassette was without the requisite mens rea or that it and does not attract the ingredients of the offence punishable under section 292 IPC.145. In another case, it was proved that the accused showed pornographic ﬁlm on the handicam to the prosecutrix. Though the charge of rape failed, conviction under sections 292 and 506 was upheld.146. Generally, evidence of expert is inadmissible whether an article or book has a tendency to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely to read, hear or see the matter in question.147. The only exception is where the likely readers belong to a special class such as young children,148. In Samaresh Base's case149. the Supreme Court of India considered the evidence of two eminent Bengali novelists to determine whether the book 'Prajapati', a Bengali novel, has a tendency to deprave and corrupt youth, who are likely to read it and having regard to their evidence decided the case in favour of the accused. It was however held that, though a Court of law may consider the views of reputed authors or leading literatures, the ultimate duty to make a proper assessment regarding obscenity or otherwise of a book rests only with the Court.150. The prosecution need not prove something which the law does not burden it with. As regards the second part of the guilty act (actus reus), i.e. the selling or keeping for sale an object which is found to be obscene, here of course the ordinary mens rea is required to be shown before the offence can be said to be complete. Even so, it was   held in this case that in criminal prosecution mens rea must necessarily be proved by circumstantial evidence alone unless the accused confesses. Thus, it is not required that prosecution must prove guilty intention to possess or possess for sale, by positive evidence. The Court will presume that the owner of the shop is guilty if the book is sold on his behalf and later found to be obscene unless he can establish that the sale was without his knowledge or consent. Thus to escape liability he has to prove his lack of knowledge.151. In India, it is also a defence to plead a certiﬁcate given by the Board of Censors. Thus, a certiﬁcate granted by the Board of Censors under section 5A of the Cinematograph Act 1952, certifying a ﬁlm to be ﬁt for public exhibition, circulation or distribution would by virtue of section 79, IPC, 1860, make prosecution under section 292, IPC, unsustainable even if the ﬁlm be obscene, lascivious or tending to deprave or corrupt public morale. This is so as section 79, IPC, (justiﬁcation on ground of bona ﬁde mistake of fact) is exculpatory when read with section 5A of the Cinematograph Act and the certiﬁcate issued thereunder.152."

Therefore, in order to make the provision more stringent and grave insofar as it relates to the sale, of obscene objects to younger persons–aged less than 20 years, a separate penal provision, made applicable in section 293, was introduced. It is in that context, the word 'obscene' occurring in section 292(1) is made applicable to section 293 also.158.

The Court must have regard to the fact that the certiﬁcate represents the judgment of a body of persons particularly selected under the statute for the speciﬁc purpose of adjudging the suitability of ﬁlms for public exhibition, and that judgment extends to a consideration of the principal ingredients which go to constitute the offences under sections 292 and 293 of the IPC,",

But, if it is caused in doing an unlawful act, the question arises whether he should be punished for causing it. The Code says that when a person engaged in the commission of an offence causes death by pure accident, he shall suffer only the punishment of his offence, without any addition on account of such accidental death. See Illustration (c) to this section. The offence of culpable homicide supposes an intention, or knowledge of likelihood of causing death. In the absence of such intention or knowledge, the offence committed may be grievous hurt,16. or simple hurt.17. It is only where death is attributed to an injury which the offender did not know would endanger life or would be likely to cause death and which in normal conditions would not do so notwithstanding death being caused, that the offence will not be culpable homicide but grievous or simple hurt. Every such case depends upon the existence of abnormal conditions unknown to the person who   inﬂicts the injury.18. A person who voluntarily inﬂicts injury such as to endanger life must always, except in the most extraordinary and exceptional circumstances, be taken to know that he is likely to cause death. If the victim is actually killed, the conviction in such cases ought ordinarily to be of the offence of culpable homicide.19. Once it is established that an act was a deliberate act and was not the result of accident or rashness or negligence, it is obvious that the offence would be culpable homicide.20."

The reason for this provision is obvious that it is not always that proper remedies and skilful treatment are within the reach of a wounded man.24. Although proof be given that the wound or other bodily injury if skilfully treated might not have resulted in death, yet, if in fact death is the result, the wound 'causes' death. And it does not avail the offender to prove that the ﬁrst cause might have been removed or rendered inoperative by the application of proper remedies and that death might have been prevented. 'Proper remedies and skilful treatment' may not be within the reach of the wounded man; or if they are at hand, he may be unable or unwilling to resort to them. But this is immaterial so far as it relates to the due interpretation of the words 'cause of death'. The primary cause which sets in motion some other cause,—as the severe wound which induces gangrene or fever, and the ultimate effect, death, are suﬃciently connected as cause and effect, notwithstanding that the supervening sickness or disease might have been cured by medical skill. All that it is essential to establish is that the death has been caused by the bodily injury and, if there be any intervening cause, that it is connected with a suﬃcient degree of probability with the primary one.25.  If death results from an injury voluntarily caused, the person who causes that injury is deemed to have caused death although the life of the victim might have been saved if proper medical attention had been given, and even if medical treatment was given but   was not the proper treatment, provided that it was administered in good faith by a competent physician or surgeon.26."

ILLUSTRATIONS (a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A commits  murder. (b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause  his death, strikes him with the intention of causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been suﬃcient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death. (c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound suﬃcient to cause the death  of a man in the ordinary course of nature. Z dies in consequence. Here, A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z's death. (d) A without any excuse ﬁres a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills  one of them. A is guilty of murder, although he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual. When culpable homicide is not murder. Exception 1.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident. The above exception is subject to the following provisos:—   First.—That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any person. Secondly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant. Thirdly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence. Explanation.—Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact. ILLUSTRATIONS (a) A, under the inﬂuence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z,  intentionally kills Y, Z's child. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the provocation. (b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, ﬁres a pistol  at Y, neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable homicide. (c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by  the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers. (d) A appears as witness before Z, a Magistrate, Z says that he does not believe a  word of A's deposition, and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder. (e) A attempts to pull Z's nose, Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays  hold of A to prevent him from doing so. A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was given by a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence. (f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander,  intending to take advantage of B's rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B's hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder. Exception 2.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, in the exercise in good faith of the right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence. ILLUSTRATION Z attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. A believing in good faith that he   can by no other means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has not committed murder, but only culpable homicide. Exception 3.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is caused. Exception 4.—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden ﬁght in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. Explanation.—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the ﬁrst assault. Exception 5.—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent. ILLUSTRATION A, by instigation, voluntarily causes, Z, a person under eighteen years of age, to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z's youth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder.",
        "section_comments": "In this section, the deﬁnition of culpable homicide appears in an expanded form. Each of the four clauses requires that the act which causes death should be done intentionally, or with the knowledge or means of knowing that death is a natural consequence of the act. An intention to kill is not always necessary to make out a case of murder. A knowledge that the natural and probable consequence of an act would be death will suﬃce for a conviction under section 302, IPC, 1860.31.",

            "sub_section_description": "The distinction between these two offences is very ably set forth by Melvill, J, in Govinda's case32. and by Sarkaria, J, in Punnayya's case.33. Since the decision of the   Supreme Court is the law of the land by virtue of Article 141 of the Constitution, relevant passages from Punnayya's case are reproduced below for the guidance of all concerned. In the scheme of the Penal Code, 'culpable homicide' is genus and 'murder' its specie. All 'murder' is 'culpable homicide' but not vice versa. Speaking generally 'culpable homicide sans 'special characteristics of murder' is culpable homicide not amounting to murder'. For the purpose of ﬁxing punishment, proportionate to the gravity of this generic offence, the Code practically recognises three degrees of culpable homicide. The ﬁrst is, what may be called, culpable homicide of the ﬁrst degree. This is the gravest form of culpable homicide which is deﬁned in s. 300 as 'murder'. The second may be termed as 'culpable homicide of the second degree'. This is punishable under the 1st part ofs. 304. Then, there is 'culpable homicide of the third degree'. This is the lowest type of culpable homicide and the punishment provided for it is also the lowest among the punishments provided for the three grades. Culpable homicide of this degree is punishable under the Second Part of s. 304.  The academic distinction between 'murder' and 'culpable homicide not amounting to murder' has vexed the Courts for more than a century. The confusion is caused, if Courts losing sight of the true scope and meaning of the terms used by the legislature in these sections allow themselves to be drawn into minute abstractions. The safest way of approach to the interpretation and application of these provisions seems to be keeping in focus the key words used in the various clauses of sections 299 and 300. The following comparative table will be helpful in appreciating the points of distinction between the two offences. Section 299  Section 300  A person commits culpable homicide if the act Subject to certain exceptions, culpable by which the death is caused is done -  homicide is murder if the act by which the death is caused is done -  INTENTION (a) with the intention of causing death; or  (1) with the intention of causing death; or  (b) with the intention of causing such bodily  (2) with the intention of causing such bodily  injury as is likely to cause death; or  injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused; or (3) with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury intended to be inﬂicted is suﬃcient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death; or  KNOWLEDGE (c) with the knowledge that the act is likely to  (4) with the knowledge that the act is so  cause death.  imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and without any excuse or incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as is mentioned above.  Clause (b) of section 299 corresponds with clauses (2) and (3) of section 300. The distinguishing feature of the mens rea requisite under clause (2) is the knowledge possessed by the offender regarding the particular victim being in such a peculiar condition or state of health that the intentional harm caused to him is likely to be fatal, notwithstanding the fact that such harm would not in the ordinary way of nature be suﬃcient to cause death of a person in normal health or condition. It is noteworthy that the 'intention to cause death' is not an essential requirement of clause (2). Only the intention of causing the bodily injury coupled with the offender's knowledge of the likelihood of such injury causing the death of the particular victim is suﬃcient to bring   the killing within the ambit of this clause. This aspect of clause (2) is borne out by Illustration (b) appended to section 300. Clause (b) of section 299 does not postulate any such knowledge on the part of the offender. Instances of cases falling under clause (2) of section 300 can be where the assailant causes death by a ﬁst blow intentionally given knowing that the victim is suffering from an enlarged liver, or enlarged spleen or diseased heart and such blow is likely to cause death of that particular person as a result of the rupture of the liver, or spleen or the failure of the heart, as the case may be. If the assailant had no such knowledge about the disease or special frailty of the victim, nor an intention to cause death or bodily injury suﬃcient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, the offence will not be murder, even if the injury which caused the death, was intentionally given. In clause (3) of section 300, instead of the words, 'likely to cause death' occurring in the corresponding clause (b) of section 299, the words \"suﬃcient in the ordinary course of nature\" have been used. Obviously, the distinction lies between a bodily injury likely to cause death and a bodily injury suﬃcient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. The distinction is ﬁne but real, and, if overlooked, may result in miscarriage of justice. The difference between clause (b) of section 299 and clause (3) of section 300 is one of the degree of probability of death resulting from the intended bodily injury. To put it more broadly, it is the degree of probability of death which determines whether a culpable homicide is of the gravest, medium or the lowest degree. The word \"likely\" in clause (b) of section 299 conveys the sense of 'probable' as distinguished from a mere possibility. The words 'bodily injury... suﬃcient in the ordinary course of nature to cause 'death' mean that death will be the most probable result of the injury, having regard to the ordinary course of nature. For cases to fall within clause (3), it is not necessary that the offender intended to cause death, so long as the death ensues from the intentional bodily injury or injuries suﬃcient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. Clause (c) of section 299 and clause (4) of section 300 both require knowledge of the probability of the act causing death. It is not necessary for the purpose of this case to dilate much on the distinction between these corresponding clauses. It will be suﬃcient to say that clause (4) of section 300 would be applicable where the knowledge of the offender as to the probability of death of a person in general as distinguished from a particular person or persons being caused from his imminently dangerous act, approximates to a practical certainty. Such knowledge on the part of the offender must be of the highest degree of probability, the act having been committed by the offender without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid.34. In Ajit Singh v State of Punjab,35. the Supreme Court observed that: In order to hold whether an offence would fall u/s. 302 or s. 304 Part I of the Code, the Courts have to be extremely cautious in examining whether the same falls u/s. 300 of the Code which states whether a culpable homicide is murder, or would it fall under its ﬁve exceptions which lay down when culpable homicide is not murder.  In other words, section 300 states both, what is murder and what is not. First ﬁnds place in section 300 in its four stated categories, while the second ﬁnds detailed mention in the stated ﬁve Exceptions to section 300. The legislature in its wisdom, thus, covered the entire gamut of culpable homicide 'amounting to murder' as well as that 'not amounting to murder' in a composite manner in section 300 of the Code.36. From the above conspectus, it emerges that whenever a Court is confronted with the question of whether the offence is 'murder' or 'culpable homicide not amounting to murder' on the facts of a case, it will be convenient for it to approach the problem in   three stages. The question to be considered at the ﬁrst stage would be, whether the accused has done an act by doing which he has caused the death of another. Proof of such causal connection between the act of the accused and the death leads to the second stage for considering whether that act of the accused amounts to \"culpable homicide\" as deﬁned in section 299. If the answer to this question is prima facie found in the aﬃrmative, the stage for considering the operation of section 300, IPC, 1860, is reached. This is the stage at which the Court should determine whether the facts proved by the prosecution bring the case within the ambit of any of the four clauses of the deﬁnition of 'murder' contained in section 300. If the answer to this question is in the negative, the offence would be 'culpable homicide not amounting to murder', punishable under the ﬁrst or the second part of section 304, depending, respectively, on whether the second or the third clause of section 299 is applicable. If this question is found in the positive, but the case comes within any of the Exceptions enumerated in section 300, the offence would still be 'culpable homicide not amounting to murder', punishable under the ﬁrst part of section 304, IPC, 1860. The above are only broad guidelines and not cast-iron imperatives. In most cases, their observance will facilitate the task of the Court. But sometimes the facts are so intertwined and the second and the third stages so telescoped into each other, that it may not be convenient to give a separate treatment to the matters involved in the second and third stages. To sum up: Section 299 is divided into three parts. The ﬁrst part refers to the act by which the death is caused by being done with the intention of causing death. That part corresponds to the ﬁrst part of the section 300, IPC. The second part of section 299, IPC speaks of the intention to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death. This has corresponding provisions in clauses \"Secondly\" and \"Thirdly\" of section 300, IPC, section 304, Part I, IPC, covers cases which by reason of the Exceptions under section 300, IPC, are taken out of the purview of cls. (1), (2) and (3) of section 300, IPC, but otherwise would fall within it and also cases which fall within the second part of section 299 but not within section 300 clauses (2) and (3). The third part of section 299 corresponds to \"fourthly\" of section s. 300. Section 304, Part-II, IPC, covers those cases which fall within the third part of section 299 but do not fall within the fourth clause of section 300.37.  Section 300 states both, what is murder and what is not. First ﬁnds place in section 300 in its four stated categories, while the second ﬁnds detailed mention in the stated ﬁve Exceptions to section 300. The legislature in its wisdom, thus, covered the entire gamut of culpable homicide 'amounting to murder' as well as that 'not amounting to murder' in a composite manner in section 300 of the Code.38."

In Arumugam Servai v State of TN,42. the Supreme Court strongly deprecated the practice of khap/katta panchayats taking law into their own hands and indulging in offensive activities which endanger the personal lives of the persons marrying according to their choice.43. Law Commission of India studied the matter and submitted the 242nd report to the Government. Some proposals are being mooted proposing amendments to section 300, IPC, 1860 by way of including what is called 'Honour Killing' as murder and shifting the burden of proof to the accused. But the Commission expressed the view that there is no need for introducing a provision in section 300, IPC, 1860 in order to bring the so called 'honour killings' within the ambit of this provision. According to the report, the existing provisions in IPC, 1860 are adequate enough to take care of the situations leading to overt acts of killing or causing bodily harm to the targeted person who allegedly undermined the honour of the caste or community. The commission suggested a new law (instead of amending IPC, 1860) to tackle the problem namely \"Prohibition of Interference with the Freedom of Matrimonial Alliances Bill 2011\".44. In Shakti Vahini v UOI,45. the Supreme Court observed that torture or torment or illtreatment in the name of honour that tantamounts to atrophy of choice of an individual relating to love and marriage by any assembly is illegal and cannot be allowed a moment of existence.

These propositions were laid down by the Supreme Court in Dharambir Singh v State of Punjab, Criminal Appeal No. 98 of 1958, decided, Nov. 4, 1958 SC48. and were given anxious consideration by Hidayatullah, J, in Anant Chintaman Lagu v State of Bombay.49. The learned judge (afterwards CJ) did not consider them as invariable criteria of proof to be established by the prosecution in every case of murder by poisoning. This is so \"because\", as the learned judge said: evidently if after poisoning the victim, the accused destroyed all traces of the body, the ﬁrst proposition would be incapable of being proved except by circumstantial evidence. Similarly, if the accused gave a victim something to eat and the victim died immediately on the ingestion of that food with symptoms of poisoning and poison, found in the viscera, the   requirement of proving that the accused was possessed of the poison would follow the circumstance that the accused gave the victim something to eat and need not be separately proved.  Following this opinion in the case of Bhupinder Singh v State of Punjab50. and dispensing with the need for proof of possession of poison, the Supreme Court said that: we do not consider it necessary that there should be acquittal on the failure of the prosecution to prove possession of poison with the accused. Murder by poison is invariably committed under the cover and cloak of secrecy. Nobody will administer poison to another in the presence of others. The person who administers poison..... will not keep a portion of it for the investigating oﬃcer to come and collect it.... [He] would naturally take care to eliminate and destroy the evidence against him.... It would be impossible for the prosecution to prove possession of poison with the accused. The prosecution may, however, establish other circumstances consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused. The Court then would not be justiﬁed in acquitting the accused on the ground that the prosecution has failed to prove possession of poison with the accused.  Continuing further, Shetty, J said: The poison murder cases are not to be put outside the rule of circumstantial evidence. There may be very many obvious facts and circumstances in which the Court may be justiﬁed in drawing permissible inference that the accused was in possession of the poison in question.... The insistence on proof of possession of poison... invariably in every case is neither desirable nor practicable. It would mean to introduce an extraneous ingredient to the offence of murder by poisoning.  Where, therefore, neither motive nor administration of poison nor its possession by the accused could be proved, the accused had to be acquitted.51. Where it is proved that the accused administered poison, the accused must be presumed to have knowledge that his act was likely to cause death.52. If the prosecution failed to prove the cause of death, the fact that the accused failed to explain the cause of death cannot be the basis of conviction. Accused was acquitted where neither post-mortem report nor FSL report showed the administration of poison.53. Where the allegation was that the death was caused by poison mixed with alcohol, but no remnants of poisonous substance were found either in the two bottles or in the steel glass but were found only in the earth so collected from the place of occurrence, accused acquitted.54."

In the case of Mangesh v State of Maharashtra,57. the Supreme Court stated   the circumstances from which it may be gathered as to whether there was intention to cause death. It included circumstances like nature of the weapon; on what part of the body the blow was given; the amount of force; was it a result of a sudden ﬁght or quarrel; whether the incident occurred by chance or was pre-meditated; prior animosity; grave and sudden provocation; heat of passion; did the accused take any undue advantage; did he act cruelly; number of blows given, etc. Even if none of the injuries by itself was suﬃcient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, cumulatively such injuries may be suﬃcient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.58."

The suﬃciency spoken of in this clause, as already noticed, is the high probability of death in the ordinary course of nature, and if such suﬃciency exists and death is caused and the injury causing it is intentional, the case would fall under clause thirdly of section 300. All the conditions which are a prerequisite for the applicability of this clause have been established and the offence committed by the accused, in the instant case was \"murder\".59. What is required for the prosecution to prove to bring the case under clause thirdly to section 300? First, it must be established, quite objectively, that a bodily injury is present; Second, the nature of the injury must be proved and these are purely objective investigations; third, it must be proved that there was an intention to inﬂict that particular bodily injury, that is to say, that it was not accidental or unintentional, or that some other kind of injury was intended; and once these three elements are proved to be present, the enquiry proceeds further; and fourth, it must be proved that the injury of the type just described made up of the three elements set out above is suﬃcient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. This part of the enquiry is purely objective and inferential and has nothing to do with the intention of the offender. Once these four elements are established by the prosecution (and, of course, the burden is on the prosecution throughout) the offence is murder under section 300 \"thirdly\". Once the intention to cause the bodily injury actually found to be present is proved, the rest of the enquiry is purely objective and the only question is whether, as a matter of purely objective inference, the injury is suﬃcient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.60. On this particular point, there is the following pertinent observation of the Supreme Court:61. The nature of the offence does not depend merely on the location of the injury caused by the accused. The intention of the person causing the injury has to be gathered from a careful examination of the facts and circumstances of each given case….  The Supreme Court also observed that the intention to cause the requisite type of injury is a subjective inquiry, but that once that type of intention is found in the assailant, the further inquiry whether the injury was suﬃcient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death is of objective nature.62."

            "sub_section_description": "In Rampal Singh v State of UP,63. after referring to the pronouncements in Rayavarapu Punnayya (supra), Vineet Kumar Chauhan v State of UP,64. Ajit Singh v State of Punjab,65. and Mohinder Pal Jolly v State of Punjab,66. the Supreme Court opined thus:   The evidence led by the parties with reference to all these circumstances greatly helps the Court in coming to a ﬁnal conclusion as to under which penal provision of the Code the accused is liable to be punished. This can also be decided from another point of view i.e. by applying the \"principle of exclusion\". This principle could be applied while taking recourse to a two- stage process of determination. First, the Court may record a preliminary ﬁnding if the accused had committed an offence punishable under the substantive provisions of s. 302 of the Code, that is, \"culpable homicide amounting to murder\". Then second, it may proceed to examine if the case fell in any of the Exceptions detailed in s. 300 of the Code. This would doubly ensure that the conclusion arrived at by the Court is correct on facts and sustainable in law. We are stating such a proposition to indicate that such a determination would better serve the ends of criminal justice delivery.67.  The third clause of section 300 views the matter from a general standpoint. Here, the emphasis is on the suﬃciency of the injury in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. The suﬃciency is the high probability of death in the ordinary way of nature. When this suﬃciency exists and death follows and the causing of such injury is intended, the offence is murder. Sometimes the nature of the weapon used, sometimes the part of the body on which the injury is caused and sometimes both are relevant.68. In some cases, the suﬃciency of injury to cause death in the ordinary course of nature must be proved and cannot be inferred from the fact that death has in fact taken place. In such a case, it may not be open to argue backwards from the death to the blow, to hold that the suﬃciency is established because death did result. As death can take place from other causes, the suﬃciency is required to be proved by other and separate evidence.69."

However, where the medical evidence goes so far that it completely rules out all possibility of the ocular evidence being true, the ocular evidence may be disbelieved.70. The opinion given by a medical witness need not be the last word on the subject. Such opinion shall be tested by the Court. If the opinion is bereft of logic or objectivity, Court is not obliged to go by that opinion. After all, opinion is what is formed in the mind of a person regarding a fact situation. If one doctor forms one opinion and another doctor forms a different opinion on the same facts, it is open to the judge to adopt the view which is more objective or probable. Similarly, if the opinion given by one doctor is not consistent with probability, the Court has no liability to go by that opinion merely because it is said by the doctor. Of course, due weight must be given to opinions given by persons who are experts in the particular subject.71.

Thus, a man who strikes at the back of another a violent blow with a formidable weapon77. or who strikes another in the throat with a knife78. must be taken to know that he is doing an act imminently dangerous to the life of the person at whom he strikes and that a probable result of his act will be to cause that person's death.79. This clause also provides for that class of cases where the acts resulting in death are calculated to put the lives of many persons in jeopardy without being aimed at any one in particular, and are perpetrated with a full consciousness of the probable consequences, e.g., where death is caused by ﬁring a loaded gun into a crowd [vide Illustration (d)], or by poisoning a well from which people are accustomed to draw water. The Supreme Court has held that although this clause is usually invoked in those cases where there is no intention to cause the death of any particular person, the clause may on its terms be used in those cases where there is such callousness towards the result and the risk taken is such that it may be stated that the person knows that the act is likely to cause death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death.80.

'Sudden' means an action which must be quick and unexpected so far as to provoke the accused. The question of whether provocation was grave and sudden is a question of fact and not one of law. Each case is to be considered according to its own facts.87. The mode of resentment should bear some proper and reasonable relationship to the sort of provocation that has been given. The test to be applied is that of the effect of the provocation on a reasonable man, so that an unusually excitable or pugnacious individual is not entitled to rely on provocation which would not have led an ordinary person to act as he did. It is important to consider whether a suﬃcient interval has elapsed since the provocation to allow a reasonable person time to cool, and account must be taken of the instrument with which the homicide had been effected.88. The mode of resentment must bear a reasonable relationship to the provocation.89. Principles relating to \"grave and sudden provocation\" summarised by the Supreme Court (1) The test of \"grave and sudden\" provocation is whether a reasonable man, belonging to the same class of society as the accused, placed in the situation in which the accused was placed would be so provoked as to lose his self-control. (2) In India, words and gestures may also, under certain circumstances, cause grave and sudden provocation to an accused so as to bring his act within the First Exception to section 300 of the Indian Penal Code. (3) The mental background created by the previous act of the victim may be taken into consideration in ascertaining whether the subsequent act caused grave and sudden provocation for committing the offence. (4) The fatal blow should be clearly traced to the inﬂuence of passion arising from that provocation and not after the passion had cooled down by lapse of time, or otherwise giving room and scope for premeditation and calculation. KM Nanavati v State of Maharashtra.90. An offence resulting from grave and sudden provocation would normally mean that a person placed in such circumstances could lose self-control but only temporarily and that too, in proximity to the time of provocation. The provocation could be an act or series of acts done by the deceased to the accused resulting in inﬂicting of injury.91. The test of \"grave and sudden\" provocation is whether a reasonable man, belonging to the same class of society as the accused, placed in the situation in which the accused was placed would be so provoked as to lose his self-control. Words and gestures may also, under certain circumstances, cause grave and sudden provocation to an accused so as to bring his act within the Exception.

It is only where the following ingredients of Exception 1 are satisﬁed that an accused can claim mitigation of the offence committed by him from murder to culpable homicide not amounting to murder: (1) The deceased must have given provocation to the accused.

The authors of the Code observed: Wherever the limits of the right of private defence may be placed, and with whatever degree of accuracy they may be marked, we are inclined to think that it will always be expedient to make a separation between murder and... voluntary culpable homicide in defence. The chief reason for making this separation is that the law itself invites men to the very verge of the crime which we have designated as voluntary culpable homicide in defence. It prohibits such homicide indeed; but it authorizes acts which lie very near to such homicide; and this circumstance, we think, greatly mitigates the guilt of such homicide. That a man who deliberately kills another in order to prevent that other from pulling his nose should be allowed to go absolutely unpunished would be most dangerous. The law punishes and ought to punish such killing; but we cannot think that the law ought to punish such killing as murder; for the law itself has encouraged the slayer to inﬂict on the assailant any harm short of death which may be necessary for the purpose of repelling the outrage; to give the assailant a cut with a knife across the ﬁngers which may render his right hand useless to him for life, or to hurl him downstairs with such force as to break his leg; and it seems diﬃcult to conceive that circumstances which would be a full justiﬁcation of any violence short of homicide should not be a mitigation of the guilt of homicide. That a man should be merely exercising a right by fracturing the skull and knocking out the eye of an assailant, and should be guilty of the highest crime in the Code if he kills the same assailant; that there should be only a single step between perfect innocence and murder, between perfect impunity and liability to capital punishment, seems unreasonable. In a case in which the law itself empowers an individual to inﬂict any harm short of death, it ought hardly, we think, to visit him with the highest punishment if he inﬂicts death.102."

The language of Exception 4 to section 300 is, thus, clear that culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden ﬁght in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel provided the offender has not taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. In order to bring a case under Exception (4) to section 300, IPC, 1860, the evidence must show that the accused without any premeditation and in a heat of passion and without having undue advantage had not acted in cruel manner. Every one of these circumstances is required to be proved to attract Exception (4) to section 300, IPC, 1860 and it is not suﬃcient to prove only some of them. None of the ingredients have been proved in evidence to bring the case under Exception (4) to section 300, IPC, 1860.119. Case comes under Exception 4 where the prosecution evidence suﬃciently suggested that a scuﬄe had taken place on the dingy where the appellant and his companions were trying to recover the dingy while the deceased was preventing them from doing so, and in the course of this sudden ﬁght and in the heat of passion, the appellant assaulted the deceased and pushed him in the sea eventually resulting in his death.120. Where there was no pre-meditation and the act was committed in a heat of passion and the appellant had not taken any undue advantage or acted in a cruel manner and there was a ﬁght between the parties, the Supreme Court found that the case falls under the fourth exception to section 300, IPC, 1860 and the conviction altered from section 302, IPC, 1860 to section 304, Part I, IPC, 1860.121. Heat of passion requires that there must be no time for the passions to cool down and in this case the parties have worked themselves into a fury on account of the verbal altercation in the beginning.122. This Exception was held not to apply to a case where two bodies of men, for the most part armed with deadly weapons, deliberately entered into an unlawful ﬁght, each being prepared to cause the death of the other, and aware that his own might follow, but determined to do his best in self-defence, and in the course of the struggle death ensued.123. An unpremeditated assault (in which death is caused) committed in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel comes within the Exception.124. Exception 4 is attracted only when there is a ﬁght or quarrel which requires mutual provocation and blows by both sides in which the offender does not take undue advantage.125. A \"sudden ﬁght\" implies mutual provocation and blows on each side. The homicide committed is then clearly not traceable to unilateral provocation, nor could in such cases the whole blame be placed on one side. For if it were so, the Exception more appropriately applicable would be Exception 1.126. The word 'ﬁght' conveys something more than a verbal quarrel.127. It takes two to make a ﬁght. It is not necessary that weapons should be used in a ﬁght. In order to constitute ﬁght, it is necessary that blows should be exchanged even if they do not all ﬁnd their target.128. The ﬁght must be with the person who is killed and not with another person.129. The words \"undue advantage\" in this Exception means \"unfair advantage\".130. Where a wordy quarrel had taken place and the quarrel had led to the use of weapons by both the parties against each other, the Supreme Court said that it could not be held to be a kind of case in which the accused had deliberately attacked the deceased with an intention to kill them. It is a case which would fall under the Exception 4 to section 300, IPC, 1860.131. Where on account of a sudden impulse and without any intention or knowledge of the impending consequences, the accused squeezed the testicles of the other causing shock, cardiac arrest and instant death, the Supreme Court held that the offence in question amounted to grievous hurt punishable under section 325 and not under this section.132. Where two cultivating parties working in their respective ﬁelds picked up a sudden quarrel over the dividing line and death ensued, there was no previous ill-will between them and, therefore, no pre-meditation,   conviction was altered from under section 302 to one under section 304, Part I read with section 34.133. Where, on the other hand, the incident did take place at the spur of the moment and evidence showed that the accused persons intentionally assaulted the deceased and his family in a brutal manner, their conviction under section 300 was held to be proper.134. The accused persons cannot argue successfully that the incident occurred at the spur of the moment where they came to the place of occurrence armed with deadly weapons. In this case, the evidence established that it was a pre-meditated act, thus their conviction for the offence punishable under section 302, IPC, 1860 was held proper.135. In a sudden ﬁght in heat of passion and without pre-meditation the accused armed with deadly weapon inﬂicted fatal blows on the unarmed deceased even when he fell on the ground. It was held that Exception 4 of section 300 was not attracted and the conviction of the accused for murder was proper.136. Where the offender took an undue advantage or acted in a cruel and unusual manner, it was held that the beneﬁt of Exception 4 could not be given to him. The Supreme Court observed that the weapon used or the manner of attack is out of all proportion, that fact must be taken into consideration for deciding whether undue advantage was taken.137. A person opened the door on the call of his uncle who was under assault. He was unarmed and came out to see what was happening. He received a gunshot at his chest causing death. The Court said that the appellant had taken undue advantage of his position at the time. He could not claim the beneﬁt of Exception 4.138. Where though there was a sudden quarrel between the accused and the deceased, there was absolutely no ﬁght between the two as there was no exchange of blows, nor any attack from the side of the deceased who was totally unarmed but nevertheless the accused attacked the deceased with an axe causing his death, it was held that his case did not fall either within Exception 4 or Exception 2 and he was squarely liable under section 302, IPC, 1860.139. A sudden ﬁght developed between the accused and the deceased while the former was telling the latter that he should not carry his cattle by the side of the ﬁeld of the accused. Three brothers of the accused rushed to his rescue and belaboured the deceased with whatever weapons they had in their hands. The deceased died of multiple injuries and broken bones. The ferocious cruelty established intention to cause death and took the case out of the exception.140. The accused abused a road sweeper who happened to throw mud on him. The father of the sweeper slapped the accused. The infuriated accused went away and came back with others. He alone, however, inﬂicted the fatal blow. The occurrence was of sudden origin because the gap between the injury and quarrel was that of only a few minutes. There was no previous enmity and blows were not repeated as the deceased fell down helpless. There was no unusual cruelty. The beneﬁt of Exception 4 was allowed.141. In a quarrel between the accused and his father, the accused attacked his father with a dagger causing death and also attacked the intervener who were his stepmother and sisters. No injury was caused to the accused because all others were unarmed. The accused took undue advantage of that fact. He acted in a cruel manner. The exception was not attracted. He was guilty of murder.142. It cannot be said in all cases of a single blow that section 302 would not be attracted. A single blow in some cases may entail conviction under section 302 in some cases or under section 304 and in some cases under section 326. Acting on this principle in a case where the victim was invited to a particular place and there three associates of the accused caught hold of him and the accused delivered a single knife blow on the chest, about which it could not be said that it was not inﬂicted without premeditation, the Court said that it could not be said that the accused had not taken undue advantage. Exception 4 was not attracted.143.   Where the accused, who had gone along with the deceased and others, picked up a quarrel with the deceased, entered his house, and came back with a knife and gave blows to the deceased and others who tried to stop them and then ran away, it was held that Exception 4 to section 300 was not applicable. Conviction under section 302 was proper.144. A quarrel took place between a son and his father just outside the son's house. The son dragged the father into the Courtyard. His other sons came out to his rescue. The son retreated into the room, bolted it from inside and shot at them from the window. One of his brothers received a bullet at his chest and died. The plea of selfdefence was not accepted. His father and brothers were the eye-witnesses who were naturally there for saving the skin of their father. The accused shot at them from the bolted security of his room.145. A previous quarrel triggered off because of sarcastic remarks made during the occasion of a marriage. Three accused started shooting with their respective guns at unarmed victims from close range on vital parts of their bodies. The victims had merely indulged in verbal duel with them. The accused acted in cruel and unusual manner. Conviction for the offence of murder was held to be proper, Exception 4 being not applicable.146."

            "sub_section_description": "ﬁght).— Exception 4 of section 300, IPC, 1860 covers acts done in a sudden ﬁght. The said exception deals with a case of prosecution not covered by the ﬁrst exception, after which its place would have been more appropriate. The exception is founded upon the same principle, for in both there is absence of premeditation. But, while in the case of Exception 1, there is total deprivation of self-control, in the case of Exception 4, there is only that heat of passion which clouds men's sober reason and urges them to deeds which they would not otherwise do. There is provocation in Exception 4 as in Exception 1; but the injury done is not the direct consequence of that provocation. In fact, Exception 4 deals with cases in which notwithstanding that a blow may have been struck, or some provocation given in the origin of the dispute or in whatever way the quarrel may have originated, yet the subsequent conduct of both parties puts them in respect of guilt upon equal footing. A 'sudden ﬁght' implies mutual provocation and blows on each side. The homicide committed is then clearly not traceable to unilateral provocation, nor in such cases could the whole blame be placed on one side. For if it were so, the Exception more appropriately applicable would be Exception 1. There is no previous deliberation or determination to ﬁght. A ﬁght suddenly takes place, for which both parties are more or less to be blamed. It may be that one of them starts it, but if the other had not aggravated it by his own conduct, it would not have taken the serious turn it did. There is then mutual provocation and aggravation, and it is diﬃcult to apportion the share of blame which attaches to each ﬁghter. The help of Exception 4 can be invoked if death is caused (a) without premeditation; (b) in a sudden ﬁght; (c) without the offender's having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner; and (d) the ﬁght must have been with the person killed. To bring a case within Exception 4, all the ingredients mentioned in it must be found. It is to be noted that the 'ﬁght' occurring in Exception 4 to section 300, IPC, 1860 is not deﬁned in the IPC, 1860. It takes two to make a ﬁght. Heat of passion requires that there must be no time for the passions to cool down and in this case, the parties have worked themselves into a fury on account of the verbal altercation in the beginning. A ﬁght is a combat between two and more persons whether with or without weapons. It is not possible to enunciate any general rule as to what shall be deemed to be a sudden quarrel. It is a question of fact and whether a quarrel is sudden or not must necessarily depend upon the proved facts of each case. For the application of Exception 4, it is not suﬃcient to show that there was a sudden quarrel and there was no premeditation. It must further be shown that   the offender has not taken undue advantage or acted in cruel or unusual manner. The expression 'undue advantage' as used in the provision means 'unfair advantage'.147. In both cases, there is absence of premeditation. But in Exception 1 there is total deprivation of self-control, in case of Exception there is such heat of passion as clouds sober reason and urges the man to do something which he would not otherwise do. A sudden ﬁght implies mutual provocation and blows on each side. The homicide in such a case is not traceable to unilateral provocation. In such cases, the whole blame cannot be attributed to one side. It may be that a ﬁght was initiated by one side but without aggravating provocation from the other side it might not have taken the serious turn. A situation of mutual provocation and aggravation develops making it diﬃcult to apportion the blame between the two sides.148."

Sometimes it is the effect of a strong sense of religious duty, sometimes of a strong sense of honour, not unfrequently of humanity. The soldier who, at the entreaty of a wounded comrade, puts that comrade out of pain, the friend who supplies laudanum to a person suffering the torment of a lingering disease, the freed man who in ancient times held out the sword that his master might fall on it, the highborn native of India who stabs the females of his family at their own entreaty in order to save them from the licentiousness of a band of marauders, would, except in Christian societies, scarcely be thought culpable, and even in Christian societies would not be regarded by the public, and ought not to be treated by the law, as assassins.149.  This exception abrogates the rule of English law that a combatant in a fair duel who kills his opponent is guilty of murder. Under this Exception, the person who is killed in a duel \"suffers or takes the risk of death by his own choice.\" In applying the Exception, it should ﬁrst be considered with reference to the act consented to or authorised, and next with reference to the person or persons authorised, and as to each of those some degree of particularity at least should appear upon the facts proved before the Exception can be said to apply. It must be found that the person killed with a full knowledge of the facts, determined to suffer death, or take the risk of death; and that this determination continued up to and existed at the moment of his death.150. The consent must have been given unconditionally and without any pre-reservation.151. The case supposed in the illustration to Exception 5 is one of the offences expressly made punishable by section 305."

There may however be cases where, on account of close proximity of place and time between the event of the accused having been last seen with the deceased and the factum of death, a rational mind may be persuaded to reach an irresistible conclusion that either the accused should explain how and in what circumstances the victim suffered the death or should own the liability for the homicide.172. But in Arabindra Mukherjee v State of WB,173.,174. it was held that once the accused was last seen with the deceased, the onus is upon him to show that either he was not involved in the occurrence at all or that he had left the deceased at her home or at any other reasonable place. To rebut the evidence of last seen and its consequences in law, the onus was upon the accused to lead   evidence in order to prove his innocence. In C Perumal v Rajasekaran,175.,176. there was a time lag of two days in last seen together of A2– A5 with the deceased and Court found it diﬃcult to connect them with the incident. Where the accused was last seen together with the deceased by his wife, but the prosecution could not establish the cause of death, the accused was not convicted based on the last seen theory.177. The circumstance of last seen together does not by itself and necessarily lead to the inference that it was the accused who committed the crime. There must be something more establishing the connectivity between the accused and the crime. Mere nonexplanation on the part of the accused by itself, cannot lead to proof of guilt against the appellant.178. Where it was found that the deceased was in the company of the accused prior to one week of the post-mortem of the deceased and it was also found through the post-mortem that the murder was about one week ago, the Court held that the last seen theory applies.179.

        "section_comments": "Doctrine of transferred malice.—Section 301 of IPC, 1860 speciﬁes that if a person by doing anything which he intends or knows to be likely to cause death, commits culpable homicide by causing death of any person whose death he neither intends, nor knows himself to be likely to cause, culpable homicide committed by the offender is of the description of which it would have been, if he had caused the death of the person, whose death he intended or knew himself to be likely to cause.183. Blow aimed at the intended victim, if alights on another, offence is the same as it would have been if the blow had struck the intended victim.184. This section lays down that culpable homicide may be committed by causing the death of a person whom the offender neither intended, nor knew himself to be likely, to kill. This section embodies what the English authors describe as the doctrine of transfer of malice or the transmigration of motive. Under this section, if A intends to kill B but kills C whose death he neither intends nor knows himself to be likely to cause, the intention to kill C is, by law attributed to him.185. If the killing takes place in the course of doing an act which a person intends or knows to be likely to cause death, it ought to be treated as if the real intention of the killer had been actually carried out. Where a mistake is made in respect of the person, as where the offender shoots at A supposing that he is shooting at B, it is clear that the difference of person can make none in the offence or its consequences; the crime consists in the wilful doing of a prohibited act; the act of shooting at A was wilful, although the offender mistook him for another. Where the accused was deliberately trying to shoot at a ﬂeeing man who had criticised his father in a School Committee Meeting but unfortunately his own maternal uncle came in between him and the intended victim and thus got killed, it was held that the act of the accused was nothing but murder under section 302 read with section 301, IPC, 1860.186. In an altercation between parties, the accused persons ﬁred indiscriminately upon the ﬂeeing party, one shot hit a person and second caused the death of the complainant's 10-year-old son. The episode took place in a commercial locality. The death was held to be intentional murder punishable under sections   300/301.187. The accused reached his intended victim's house. The latter hid himself somewhere else. The accused chased him there and standing before that house ﬁred into it. The housewife became prey and fell dead. It was held that under the doctrine of transfer of malice, the accused must be convicted under sections 302 and 307 and sentenced to life imprisonment.188. Where the accused intended to kill a particular person by his lorry but another person chanced to come before the lorry and happened to be killed, an offence under this section was committed and the accused was convicted under section 302.189. Similarly, there will be no difference where the injury intended for one falls on another by accident. If A makes a thrust at B, meaning to kill, and C throwing himself between, receives the thrust and dies, A will answer for it as if his mortal purpose had taken place on B. The same principle is applicable where, through accident or the mistake of a party not privy to the criminal design, the mischief falls either on a person not intended, or on the party intended but in a different manner from that intended.190. Accused had entered the house of witness to kill him but due to non-availability of electricity and under the wrong impression he killed the deceased. Death of deceased can be said to be accidental due to mistaken identity rather than any intentional act of accused. Order of conviction of accused under section 302, IPC, 1860 is modiﬁed to one under section 304, Part II, IPC, 1860.191. In a scuﬄe between accused persons and the complainant's party, one member on the accused's side ﬁred a shot at a particular member on the complainant's side but the shot actually hit another person who died. The Court held that the doctrine of transferred malice was attracted. The act of the accused would be covered by section 304 and he was liable to be convicted under Part II of that section, though the deceased was neither aimed at nor intended to be harmed by the accused.192. It is not a disputed fact as to whose ﬁre shot resulted in the death of the deceased. The only question which is to be examined here is whether the offence committed by the respondent is culpable homicide amounting to murder, punishable under section 302 or culpable homicide not amounting to murder, punishable under section 304, Part I. Here, the intention on the part of the respondent-accused in causing bodily injury as is likely to cause death is also not a disputed fact. The only thing which is to be tested is whether the bodily injury is covered under either of the clauses of section 300 of IPC, 1860 (transfer of malice doctrine applied).193.",

The provision of section 367(5) of the 1898 Code reads as follows: (5) If the accused is convicted of an offence punishable with death, and the Court sentences him to any punishment other than death, the Court shall in its judgment state the reason why sentence of death was not passed. In 1955, Cr PC (Amendment) Act, 1955 deleted the aforesaid section 367(5) of the 1898 Code. As a result of this amendment, which came into effect from 1 January 1956, it was no longer necessary for a Court to record in its judgment, in case of conviction in connection with an offence punishable with death, any reason for not imposing the death sentence. Thus, in the new Code, the discretion of the judge to impose death sentence has been narrowed, for the Court has to provide special reasons for imposing a sentence of death. It has made imprisonment for life the rule and death sentence an exception, in the matter of awarding punishment for murder.197. Reference to extenuating or mitigating circumstances in a case of death penalty was made possibly for the ﬁrst time by Supreme Court in the case of Nawab Singh v State of UP.198. The Court held that in the facts of that case, murder was a cruel and deliberate one and there were no extenuating circumstances. After the amendment of 1898 Code, in the year 1955, the ﬁrst case relating to death sentence, which came before Supreme Court was that of Vadivelu Thevar v State of Madras,199. in which it was held that the question of sentence has to be determined, not with reference to the volume or character of the evidence adduced by the prosecution in support of the prosecution case, but with reference to the fact whether there are any extenuating circumstances which can be said to mitigate the enormity of the crime. If the Court is satisﬁed that there are such mitigating circumstances, only then, it would be justiﬁed in imposing the lesser of the two sentences provided by law."

            "sub_section_description": "The constitutionality of death sentence was challenged in the case of Jagmohan Singh v State of UP.200. The Constitution Bench while upholding the constitutionality of death penalty examined whether total discretion can be conferred on the judges in awarding death sentence, when the statute does not provide any guidelines on how to exercise the same. The decision in Jagmohan Singh (supra) was rendered when Cr PC, 1973 was not in existence. However, the aforesaid position substantially changed with the introduction of a changed sentencing structure under Cr PC, 1973. In Rajendra Prasad v State of UP,201. it was held that the special reasons necessary for imposing a death penalty must relate not to the crime but to the criminal. It could be awarded only if the security of the state and society, public order in the interest of the general public compelled that course. Proposition laid down by the Constitution Bench in Jagmohan Singh's Case (i) The general legislative policy that underlines the structure of our criminal law,  principally contained in the IPC, 1860 and Cr PC, 1973, is to deﬁne an offence with suﬃcient clarity and to prescribe only the maximum punishment therefore, and to allow a very wide discretion to the Judge in the matter of ﬁxing the degree of punishment. With the solitary exception of section 303, the same policy permeates section 302 and some other sections of IPC, 1860, where the maximum punishment is the death penalty. (ii) (a) No exhaustive enumeration of aggravating or mitigating circumstances which  should be considered when sentencing an offender, is possible. \"The inﬁnite variety of cases and facets to each case would make general standards either meaningless 'boiler plate' or a statement of the obvious that no Jury (Judge) would need.\" (referred to McGoutha v California.202. (b) The impossibility of laying down standards is at the very core of the  criminal law as administered in India which invests the Judges with a very wide discretion in the matter of ﬁxing the degree of punishment. (iii) The view taken by the plurality in Furman v Georgia,203. decided by the Supreme  Court of the United States, to the effect, that a law which gives uncontrolled and unguided discretion to the Jury (or the Judge) to choose arbitrarily between a sentence of death and imprisonment for a capital offence, violates the Eighth Amendment, is not applicable in India. We do not have in our Constitution any provision like the Eighth Amendment, nor are we at liberty to apply the test of reasonableness with the freedom with which the Judges of the Supreme Court of America are accustomed to apply \"the due process\" clause. There are grave doubts about the expediency of transplanting western experience in our country. Social conditions are different and so also the general intellectual level. Arguments which would be valid in respect of one area of the world may not hold good in respect of another area. (iv) (a) This discretion in the matter of sentence is to be exercised by the Judge  judicially, after balancing all the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the crime. (b) The discretion is liable to be corrected by Superior Courts. The  exercise of judicial discretion on well-recognised principles is, in the ﬁnal analysis, the safest possible safeguard for the accused. In view of the above, it will be impossible to say that there would be at all any discrimination, since crime as crime may appear to be superﬁcially   the same, but the facts and circumstances of a crime are widely different. Thus considered, the provision in section 302, IPC, 1860 is not violative of Article 14 of the Constitution on the ground that it confers on the Judges an unguided and uncontrolled discretion in the matter of awarding capital punishment or imprisonment for life. (v) (a) Relevant  facts and circumstances impinging on the nature and circumstances of the crime can be brought before the Court at the preconviction stage, notwithstanding the fact that no formal procedure for producing evidence regarding such facts and circumstances had been speciﬁcally provided. Where counsel addresses the Court with regard to the character and standing of the accused, they are duly considered by the Court unless there is something in the evidence itself which belies him or the Public Prosecutor challenges the facts. (b) It is to be emphasised that in exercising its discretion to choose either  of the two alternative sentences provided in section 302, IPC, 1860: the Court is principally concerned with the facts and circumstances whether aggravating or mitigating, which are connected with the particular crime under inquiry. All such facts and circumstances are capable of being proved in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act in a trial regulated by the CrPC. The trial does not come to an end until all the relevant facts are proved and the counsel on both sides have an opportunity to address the Court. The only thing that remains is for the Judge to decide on the guilt and punishment and that is whats. 306(2) and s. 309(2), CrPC purport to provide for. These provisions are part of the procedure established by law and unless it is shown that they are invalid for any other reasons they must be regarded as valid. No reasons are offered to show that they are constitutionally invalid and hence the death sentence imposed after trial in accordance with the procedure established by law is not unconstitutional under Art. 21.

In paragraph 23.2 of the said report, the Law Commission recommended a set of new provisions for governing \"trials before a Court of sessions\". With regard tosection 309 of the 1898 Code, the Law Commission recommended that hearing of the accused was most desirable before passing any sentence against him. This recommendation was accepted and incorporated while enacting section 235, Cr PC in 1973 Code within Chapter XVIII of the same under the heading \"Trial before a Court of Sessions\". The most signiﬁcant change brought about by the incorporation of the recommendation of the Law Commission, is the giving of an opportunity of hearing to the accused on the question of sentence. This opportunity of hearing at the post-conviction stage gives the accused an opportunity to raise fundamental issues for adjudication and effective determination by Court of its sentencing discretion in a fair and reasonable manner. In Santa Singh v State of Punjab,206. the Supreme Court held that this provision is in consonance with the modern trends in penology and sentencing procedures. It was further held that proper exercise of sentencing discretion calls for consideration of various factors like the nature of offence, the circumstances—both extenuating or aggravating, the prior criminal record, if any, of the offender, the age of the offender, his background, his education, his personal life, his social adjustment, the emotional and mental condition of the offender, the prospects for the rehabilitation of the offender, the possibility of his rehabilitation in the life of community, the possibility of treatment or training of the offender, the possibility that the sentence may serve as a deterrent to crime by the offender or by others."

            "sub_section_description": "criminal).— In Bachan Singh v State of Punjab,207. another Constitution Bench, while upholding the constitutional validity of death sentence observed that for persons convicted of murder, life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence an exception. The principal questions considered in this case were: (i) Whether death penalty provided for the offence of murder in Section 302, Penal Code is unconstitutional. (ii) If the answer to the foregoing question be in the negative, whether the sentencing procedure provided in Section 354(3) of the CrPC, 1973 (Act 2 of 1974) is unconstitutional on the ground that it invests the Court with unguided and untrammelled discretion and allows death sentence to be arbitrarily or freakishly imposed on a person found guilty of murder or any other capital offence punishable under the Indian Penal Code with death or, in the alternative, with imprisonment for life.  The conclusion of the Constitution Bench was that the sentence of death ought to be given only in the 'rarest of rare cases' [See the Box with 'Supreme Court Guidelines in Bachan Singh'] and it should be given only when the option of awarding the sentence of life imprisonment is \"unquestionably foreclosed\". It laid down the framework law on this point. Bachan Singh effectively opened up Phase II of a sentencing policy by shifting the focus from the crime to the crime and the criminal. Supreme Court Guidelines in Bachan Singh (i) The extreme penalty of death need not be inﬂicted except in gravest cases of  extreme culpability; (ii) Before opting for the death penalty, the circumstances of the 'offender' also  require to be taken into consideration along with the circumstances of the   'crime'; (iii) Life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence is an exception. In other  words, death sentence must be imposed only when life imprisonment appears to be an altogether inadequate punishment having regard to the relevant circumstances of the crime, and only provided, the option to impose sentence of imprisonment for life cannot be conscientiously exercised having regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and all the relevant circumstances; (iv) A balance-sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be drawn  up and in doing so the mitigating circumstances have to be accorded full weightage and a just balance has to be struck between the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances before the option is exercised. [Bachan Singh v State of Punjab.208.] The judgment in Machhi Singh v State of Rajasthan,209. did not only state the above guidelines in some elaboration, but also speciﬁed the mitigating circumstances which could be considered by the Court while determining such serious issues.210. Despite the legislative change and Bachan Singh discarding proposition (iv)(a) of Jagmohan Singh, Supreme Court in Machhi Singh revived the \"balancing\" of aggravating and mitigating circumstances through a balance sheet theory. In doing so, it sought to compare aggravating circumstances pertaining to a crime with the mitigating circumstances pertaining to a criminal. It hardly need be stated, with respect, that these are completely distinct and different elements and cannot be compared with one another. A balance sheet cannot be drawn up of two distinct and different constituents of an incident. Nevertheless, the balance sheet theory held the ﬁeld post Machhi Singh.211.

The cardinal questions to be asked and answered are:— (a) Is there something uncommon about the crime which renders sentence of  imprisonment for life inadequate and calls for a death sentence? (b) Are the circumstances of the crime such that there is no alternative but to  impose death sentence even after according maximum weightage to the mitigating circumstances which speak in favour of the offender? If after taking into consideration all these circumstances, it is felt that death sentence is warranted, the Court would proceed to do so.216. Thus, where murder is premeditated217. or is committed in an organised manner,218. or by a hired assassin219. or by a lawyer220. or where it is gruesome221. or is committed with utmost depravity,222. death sentence seems to be the proper sentence in all such cases."

The circumstances and conditions of life have very seriously changed since then and, therefore, even if those categories are to be observed, some scope for ﬂexibility should always be maintained. Giving a brief view of the changed scenario, the Supreme Court noted that a careful reading of the Machhi Singh categories makes it clear that the classiﬁcation was made looking at murder mainly as an act of maladjusted individual criminal(s). In 1983, the country was relatively free from organised and professional crime. Abduction for ransom and gang rape and murders committed in course of those offences were yet to become a menace for the society compelling the legislature to create special slots for those offences in IPC, 1860. At the time of Machhi Singh, Delhi had not witnessed the   infamous Sikh carnage. There had been no attack on the country's Parliament. There were no bombs planted by terrorists killing completely innocent people, men, women and children in dozens with sickening frequency. There were no private armies, no maﬁa cornering huge Government contracts purely by muscle power, no reports of killings of social activists and \"whistle-blowers\", no reports of custodial deaths and rape and fake encounters by police or even by armed forces. These developments would unquestionably ﬁnd a more pronounced reﬂection in any classiﬁcation if one were to be made today. Relying upon the observations in Bachan Singh, therefore, even though the categories framed in Machhi Singh provide very useful guidelines, nonetheless those cannot be taken as inﬂexible, absolute or immutable. Further, even in those categories, there would be scope for ﬂexibility as observed in Bachan Singh itself."

RR Test depends upon the perception of the society that is \"society centric\" and not \"Judge centric\", that is, whether the society will approve the awarding of death sentence to certainty types of crimes or not.

But a two-Judge Bench in Sangeet v State of Haryana,262. in which it was held that: a reading of some recent decisions delivered by this Court seems to suggest that the remission power of the appropriate Government has effectively been nulliﬁed by awarding sentences of 20 years, 25 years and in some cases without any remission. Is this permissible? Can this Court (or any Court for that matter) restrain the appropriate Government from granting remission of a sentence to a convict? What this Court has done in Swamy Shraddananda and several other cases, by giving a sentence in a capital offence of 20 years or 30 years imprisonment without remission, is to effectively injunct the appropriate Government from exercising its power of remission for the speciﬁed period. In our opinion, this issue needs further and greater discussion, but as at present advised, we are of the opinion that this is not permissible. The appropriate Government cannot be told that it is prohibited from granting remission of a sentence. Similarly, a convict cannot be told that he cannot apply for a remission in his sentence, whatever the reason. In this case, though the Division Bench raised a doubt about the decision of a three-Judge Bench in Swamy Shraddananda (supra), yet the same has not been referred to a larger Bench.  In Sahib Hussain @ Sahib Jan v State of Rajasthan,263. another two-Judge Bench reiterated the position held in Swamy Shraddananda (supra) by holding that the observations in Sangeet (supra) are not warranted. In Gurvail Singh @ Gala v State of Punjab,264. other two-Judge bench also termed the remarks in Sangeet (supra) as 'unwarranted' and opined that if the two-judge bench was of the opinion that earlier judgments, even of a larger Bench were not justiﬁed, the Bench ought to have referred the matter to the larger Bench. However, in some cases, the Court had also been voicing concern about the statutory basis of such orders.265. In a judgment,266.

In TV Vatheeswaran,271. overruled in Triveni Ben v State of Gujarat,272. a two-Judge Bench of Supreme Court considered whether the accused, who was convicted for an offence of murder and sentenced to death, kept in solitary conﬁnement for about eight years was entitled to commutation of death sentence. It was held that delay exceeding two years in the execution of a sentence of death should be considered suﬃcient to entitle the person under sentence of death to invoke Article 21 and demand the quashing of the sentence of death.273. But a three-Judge bench in Sher Singh v State of Punjab,274. held that though prolonged delay in the execution of a death sentence is unquestionably an important consideration for determining whether the sentence should be allowed to be executed, no hard and fast rule that \"delay exceeding two years in the execution of a sentence of death should be considered suﬃcient to entitle the person under sentence of death to invoke Art. 21 and demand the quashing of the sentence of death\" can be laid down as has been done in Vatheeswaran (supra). Javed Ahmed v State of Maharashtra,275. reiterated the proposition laid down in Vatheeswaran (supra) case and doubted the competence of the three-judge bench to overrule the Vatheeswaran case. The conﬂicting views are ﬁnally settled by the Constitution Bench in Triveni Ben v State of Gujarat.276. It overruled Vatheeswaran (supra) holding that undue long delay in execution of the sentence of death will entitle the condemned person to approach the Supreme Court under Article 32 but the Court will only examine the nature of delay caused and circumstances that ensued after sentence will ﬁnally be conﬁrmed by the judicial process and will have no jurisdiction to reopen the conclusions reached by the Court while ﬁnally maintaining the sentence of death. Court, however, may consider the question of inordinate delay in the light of all circumstances of the case to decide whether the execution of sentence should be carried out or should be altered into imprisonment for life. No ﬁxed period of delay could be held to make the sentence of death inexecutable and to this extent the decision in Vatheeswaran's case cannot be said to lay down the correct law. In Madhu Mehta v UOI,277. Supreme Court commuted the death sentence on the ground that the mercy petition was pending for eight years after disposal of the criminal appeal by Supreme Court. It is well established that exercising of power under Article 72/161 by the President or the Governor is a constitutional obligation and not a mere prerogative. Considering the high status of oﬃce, the Constitutional framers did not stipulate any outer time limit for disposing the mercy petitions under the said Articles, which means it should be decided within reasonable time. However, when the delay caused in disposing the mercy petitions is seen to be unreasonable, unexplained and exorbitant, it is the duty of the Supreme Court to step in and consider this aspect.278.  [s 302.13.1] Nirbhaya Case279..—   In this case, the Supreme Court analysed all the decisions, where the question of imposing the death penalty was discussed and examined the aggravating and mitigating circumstances and opined that the appetite for sex, the hunger for violence, the position of the empowered and the attitude of perversity of the accused, to say the least, are bound to shock the collective conscience which knows not what to do. The Supreme Court observed that: the casual manner with which she was treated and devilish manner in which they played with her identity and dignity is humanly inconceivable. It sounds like a story from different world where humanity has been treated with irreverence. Aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating circumstances.  The Supreme Court held the accused persons guilty of offences which are brutal, diabolic and barbaric in nature and fall within category of rarest of rare cases.

It was accordingly held that it was not a ﬁt case for extreme penalty. The sentence for life imprisonment was conﬁrmed.281. There was a conspiracy in the wake of a property dispute in which contract killers were hired and death was caused. Sethi, J, of the Supreme Court said that this was not the rarest of rare case. The accused was a misled youth. He was liable to be sentenced to life imprisonment for the major offence of murder.282. In a case arising out of partition between two brothers, one of them (the accused) killed his brother, his wife and children. He was frustrated over his failure to resist partition of joint property. The Court agreed that it was a heinous and brutal crime, but was not in the category of rarest of rare cases. The accused did not have any criminal tendency. He was a State Government employee and not a menace to the society. The Court directed his death sentence to be reduced to 20 years actual imprisonment including the period already undergone.283. In a rape and murder case of an 11-year-old child, there was extra judicial confession made to a senior person to seek his help. He indicated the place where the body of the girl was lying. He struck her in the head twice over with a brick and then in the mouth only when she threatened to disclose. This showed that he had no intention to commit murder and injuries were inﬂicted only at the spur of the moment. He had no criminal record nor he was in any way a danger to the society. Death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.284. The Court has to draw a balance between the aggravating and mitigating factors. The accused in this case was the member of a para-military force. He killed seven members of a family in a pre-planned manner. He was 23 at the time and had no criminal record. He and his family members were suffering agony at the hands of the victim family. He had a cause to feel aggrieved for the injustice meted out to his family members. The Court said that it was not the rarest of rare cases. His death sentence was reduced to life imprisonment.285.  [s 302.14.1] Where attribution of exact role not possible.—   One of the accused persons was the relative of the deceased family. They not only merely robbed the family of valuables but also killed three members of the family who were present at the time. They also raped the only female member in the house. The mitigating factors which the judge took into account in commuting death sentence into life imprisonment were that they were neither too old nor too young to be beyond reformation and rehabilitation. It was diﬃcult also to judge as to what part was played by one or the other and, therefore, who among them would come in the \"rarest\" category.286.  [s 302.14.2] Killing of wife and children in frustration.— Though the accused had some suspicion about the character of his wife, the facts showed that he killed his wife and children because of unhappiness and frustration and not because of any criminal tendency. The penalty of death was set aside and he was sentenced to life imprisonment.287. The accused requested his wife to accompany him to his house. She turned it down. This created frustration and anger in his mind. He picked up a sharp-edged weapon and mercilessly struck her and also his mother-in-law repeatedly. Both of them fell dead. The Court said that the case was not of the rarest category. Death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.288.  [s 302.14.3] Death in custody.— The Supreme Court observed as follows: There is a rise in incidents of custodial deaths but accused cannot be convicted completely de hors the evidence and its admissibility according to law. Court cannot act on presumption merely on a strong suspicion or assumption and presumption. A presumption can only be drawn when it is permissible under the law. Rushing into conclusions without there being any proper link with commission of crime is improper. The view taken by the trial Court was just and proper in the given facts and circumstances of the case and it was not proper for the High Court to reverse the ﬁnding. Reasons given by the High Court in reversing the order of acquittal of accused persons were not cogent and did not appeal to reason so as to justify conviction of the appellants. Hence, impugned judgment of the High Court was set aside.289.  [s 302.14.4] Restoration of death penalty after acquittal.— The trial Court awarded death sentence. The High Court acquitted the accused in 1982. The Supreme Court said that the accused having enjoyed acquittal, death sentence could not be restored even if the case merited the imposition of death penalty.290."

            "sub_section_description": "The doctrine of rarest of rare case was enunciated by the Supreme Court in Bachan Singh v State of Punjab.292. The trial Court, High Courts and even the Supreme Court are duty bound to follow it.293. The Court explained in this case some of the relevant factors as follows: Not only the doctrine of proportionality but also doctrine of rehabilitation should be taken into consideration, particularly in view of section 354(3), Cr PC, 1973, which must be read with Article 21 of the Constitution. Where there was nothing to show that the appellant-accused could not be reformed and rehabilitated, the mere manner of disposal of the dead body, howsoever abhorrent, should not by itself be regarded suﬃcient to bring the case in the rarest of rare category. In the present case, all the accused including the appellant were unemployed young men in search of job. They were not criminals. In exception of a plan proposed by the appellant and accepted by them, they kidnapped a friend of theirs with the motive of procuring ransom from his family but later murdered him, and after cutting his body into pieces, disposed of the same at different places. One of the accuseds turned approver and prosecution case was based exclusively on his evidence. Appellant-accused contradicted the approver's version in respect of his role. In such a case, statement of approver regarding manner of murder and role of accused and that of approver himself, should be tested on the basis of prudence doctrine taking into consideration inter alia, evidence produced by the accused for imposition of lesser punishment. Hence, death penalty awarded by the Courts below, in the absence of any special reasons to support the same was substituted by penalty of rigorous imprisonment for life. Death punishment stands on a very different footing from other types of punishments. It is unique in its total irrevocability. Incarceration, life or otherwise, potentially serves more than one sentencing aims. Deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation and retribution all ends are capable to be furthered in different degrees, by calibrating this punishment in light of the overarching penal policy. But the same does not hold true of death penalty.294. One has to observe the global move away from the death penalty. Latest statistics show that 138 nations have abolished death penalty in either law or practice (no executions for 10 years). Further, on 18 December 2007, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 62/149 calling upon countries that retain death penalty to establish a worldwide moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty. India is, however, one of the 59 nations that retain the death penalty.295. The Law Commission of India in its Report No. 262 titled \"The Death Penalty\" has recommended the abolition of death penalty for all the crimes other than terrorism related offences and waging war (offences affecting National Security). Where the question of whether death penalty could be imposed in a case which depended upon circumstantial evidence, the Supreme Court said: If the circumstantial evidence is found to be of unimpeachable character in establishing the guilt of the accused, that form the foundation for conviction and that has nothing to do with the question of sentence. Mitigating circumstances and the aggravating circumstances have to be balanced and in the balance sheet of such circumstances. The fact that the case rests on circumstantial evidence has no role to play. In fact, in most of the cases where death sentences are awarded for rape and murder and the like, there is practically no scope for getting an eyewitness. Such offences are not committed in public view. Only available evidence in such cases is   circumstantial. If such evidence is found to be credible, cogent and trustworthy for the purpose of recording conviction, to treat such evidence as a mitigating circumstance, would amount to consideration of an irrelevant aspect. Hence, such plea is unsustainable. Instant case fell in category of the rarest of rare cases. Circumstances proved established the depraved acts of the accused, and they called for only one sentence, that is, death sentence. Judgment of the High Court, conﬁrming the conviction and sentence imposed by the trial Court, does not warrant any interference.296.  [s 302.16.1] Punishment of terrorists.— The prosecution case was that the accused persons came running to a police picket and hurled bombs at security personnel. There was good identiﬁcation evidence. Injuries on the persons of the accused were scabbed burn injuries caused by handling of explosive substance. The medical evidence showed that abrasions on the body of the deceased could have been caused by splinters from bomb explosions. The case being proved beyond any reasonable doubt, the conviction for murder was fully justiﬁed.297.  [s 302.16.2] Hearing before awarding death sentence.— The matter was remitted where death sentence was awarded without hearing the accused.298. It is necessary to afford opportunity of hearing to the accused on the question of sentence, where life imprisonment or death sentence is awarded.299."

            "sub_section_description": "In cases where mere circumstantial evidence exists, the burden of proof as envisaged under section 106 of the Evidence Act, 1872, i.e., the burden of proving the fact, which is especially within the knowledge of a person, plays an important role in several cases. Where the dead body of the deceased was found in the river, the knowledge about that incident was within the special knowledge of the accused. As the deceased was in the custody of the accused and disappeared from their house, the accused did not reveal what happened to the deceased. The Supreme Court held that the accused failed to discharge their duty under section 106 of the Evidence Act, 1872. The prosecution is not expected to give the exact manner in which the deceased was killed. Adverse inference needs to be drawn against the accused, as they failed to explain how the deceased was found dead in the river in one-foot deep water. Referring to section 106 of the Evidence Act, 1872, it was propounded that the said section was not intended to relieve the prosecution of its burden to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, but would apply to cases where prosecution had succeeded in proving facts from which a reasonable inference could be drawn regarding the existence of certain other facts, unless the accused, by virtue of his special knowledge regarding such facts, succeeds in offering any explanation, to drive the Court to draw a different inference.305. In Gajanan Dashrath Kharate v State of Maharashtra,306. the deceased was found within the company of the accused and on the next day was found dead. Blood stained dress of the accused with the blood of the deceased was recovered. The Supreme Court held that when an offence like murder is committed in secrecy inside a house, the initial burden to establish the case would undoubtedly be upon the prosecution. In view of section 106 of the Evidence Act, 1872, there will be a corresponding burden on the inmates of the house to give cogent explanation as to how the crime was committed. When the deceased is shown to be abducted, it is for the abductors to explain how they dealt with the abducted victim. In the absence of an explanation, the Court is to draw inference that the abductors are the murderers.307. In the examination under section 313, Cr PC, 1973, the accused denied any knowledge of the crime and alleged false implication. Section 106 of the Evidence Act, 1872 imposes an obligation on the accused to explain as to what happened after they were last seen together.308. The mere circumstance that the accused was last seen with the deceased is an unsafe hypothesis to ﬁnd a conviction on a charge of murder. The lapse of time between the point when the accused was last seen with the deceased and the time of death has to be minimal.309. When the prosecution mainly relies on section 106 of the Evidence Act,1872, the Supreme Court held, in a case where murder took place in a hotel room, that to invoke that section, the main point to be established by the prosecution is that the accused persons were present in the hotel room at the relevant time. In this case, the prosecution failed to produce the CCTV footages available at the hotel where the murder took place, the Court further observed that the CCTV footage being a crucial piece of evidence, it is for the prosecution to have produced the best evidence, which was missing.310. In the absence of any persuasive evidence to hold that at the relevant time the appellant was present in the house, it would also be impermissible to cast any burden on him as contemplated under section 106 of the Evidence Act, 1872.311."

Even with the aid of the presumption under section 114 of the Evidence Act, 1872, the charge of murder cannot be brought home unless there is some evidence to show that the robbery and murder occurred at the same time, i.e., in the course of the same transaction.313."

While under section 302, the Court cannot, in its discretion, award sentence lesser than life imprisonment. The ingredients of both these offences, to some extent, are also different inasmuch as to complete an offence of 'dacoity'. Under section 396, IPC, 1860, ﬁve or more persons must conjointly commit the robbery while under section 302 of the IPC, 1860 even one person by himself can commit the offence of murder. But, as already noticed, to attract the provisions of section 396, the offence of 'dacoity' must be coupled with murder. In other words, the ingredients of section 302 becomes an integral part of the offences punishable under section 396 of the IPC, 1860.314."

            "sub_section_description": "The Indian Penal Code was enacted in the year 1860 under which the offences within the territory of India have been tried ever since it was enacted dealing with countless number of cases leading either to acquittal or conviction. Yet, the task of the decisionmaking authorities/Courts of whether an offence of culpable homicide is murder or culpable homicide does not amount to murder in the prevailing facts and circumstances of the case is a perennial question with which the Courts are often confronted. When the evidence discloses a clear case of murder or makes out a ﬁnding of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, the task of the Courts to record conviction or acquittal is generally an easy one. But this task surely becomes an undaunted one when the accused commits culpable homicide/murder but the circumstances disclose many a times that it is done without premeditation or preplanning, may be to cause grievous hurt, yet it is so grave in nature that it results into death and the role of the factum causing death without premeditation becomes a secondary consideration due to which the decision of the Courts in such cases often hinges on discretion while considering whether the case would fall under section 302, IPC, 1860 or it would be under section 304, Part I or even Part II, IPC, 1860. On a plain reading of section 299, section 300, section 302 and section 304 of IPC, 1860, it appears that given cases can be conveniently classiﬁed into two categories, viz., culpable homicide amounting to murder which is section 302, IPC, 1860 or culpable homicide not amounting to murder which is section 304 IPC, 1860. But when it comes to the actual application of these two sections in a given case, the Courts are often confronted with a dilemma as to whether a case would fall under section 302, IPC, 1860 or would fall under section 304, IPC, 1860. Many a time, this gives rise to conﬂicting decisions of one Court or the other giving rise to the popular perception among litigants and members of the Bar that a particular Court is an acquitting Court or is a convicting one. This confusion or dilemma often emerges in a case when the question for consideration is whether a given case would fall under section 302, IPC, 1860 or section 304, IPC, 1860 when it is diﬃcult to decipher from the evidence whether the intention was to cause merely bodily injury which would not make out an offence of murder or there was clear intention to kill the victim making out a clear case of an offence of murder.326. Section 300 states both, what is murder and what is not. First ﬁnds place in section 300 in its four stated categories, while the second ﬁnds detailed mention in the stated ﬁve exceptions to section 300. The legislature in its   wisdom, thus, covered the entire gamut of culpable homicide that 'amounting to murder' as well as that 'not amounting to murder' in a composite manner in section 300 of the Code. It is neither advisable nor possible to state any straightjacket formula that would be universally applicable to all cases for such determination. Every case essentially must be decided on its own merits. The Court has to perform the very delicate function of applying the provisions of the Code to the facts of the case with a clear demarcation as to under what category of cases, the case at hand falls and accordingly punish the accused.327.

The accused followed his daughter into the women's public toilet of the village and assaulted her. The fatal injuries resulted in her instant death. None of the exceptions in section 300 of IPC, 1860 was attracted. It would necessarily follow that the accused committed murder of his daughter. He was liable to be punished with either imprisonment for life or death under section 302, IPC, 1860 alone.330. The accused killed his stepfather, who was an inﬁrm old man and an invalid, with the latter's consent, his motive being to get three innocent men (his enemies) hanged. It was held that the offence was covered by Exception 5 to section 300 and was punishable under the ﬁrst Part of this section.331. Where the deceased, an old man with an enlarged and ﬂabby heart, was lifted by the accused during a quarrel and thrown on the ground from some distance with suﬃcient force and the deceased got his ribs fractured and died of a rupture of the heart, it was held that the offence fell under section 325 and not under Part II of this section, as the accused had no intention or knowledge to cause death.332. Accused stabbed the deceased in a sudden incident during an election fever which resulted in his death four days later in hospital where he had been operated upon in a bid to save his life. There was no evidence that the accused intended to cause death or cause such bodily injury as was suﬃcient in ordinary course of nature to cause death. In the circumstances, it was held that the case fell within clause (b) of section 299 but did not fall within clause 3 of section 300, IPC, 1860, and as such his conviction under section 302 was set aside and he was convicted under section 304, Part I of the Code.333. Similarly, where a young lad of 18½ years old gave only one kassi blow to the deceased following an altercation between his father and the deceased, which resulted in latter's death six days after, it could not be said that he had intended to cause an injury which was suﬃcient in ordinary course of nature to cause death within the meaning of clause 3 of section 300, IPC, 1860. He could be at best saddled with knowledge that his act might result in death. His conviction was, therefore, changed from section 302 to section 304, Part II, IPC, 1860.334. Accused, in a sudden quarrel gave a blow on the head of his friend with a stick weighing only 210 grams which caused his death. It was held that his conviction under section 304, Part II, IPC, 1860, was improper as it could not be said that he had knowledge that such a blow would cause death. His conviction was, therefore, changed to one under section 323, IPC, 1860.335. In a dispute regarding the right of way, the accused gave a single ﬁst blow on the head of the deceased which resulted into his death. No weapon was used, nor was there any past enmity between them. The accused was not held to be responsible for the death of the deceased and   was sentenced under section 323, IPC, 1860.336. Where a man lifted a four-year-old child and threw him on the ground and thus caused his death, it was held that knowledge of death under section 299, IPC, 1860, could be safely attributed to him and he was therefore liable under section 304, Part-II, IPC, 1860.337. In a sudden quarrel, the accused, a young man, administered a single knife blow on the chest of the deceased causing his death, it was held that the case did not fall under clauses 1 and 2 of section 300 but since he had knowledge that death might follow, he was guilty under section 304, Part II, IPC, 1860.338. A police oﬃcer was punished under Part II of this section with seven-year RI for causing death in custody by resorting to third-degree methods.339. A woman deserted her husband and started living with her paramour six months before the incident. Her ﬁsherman husband, on way back from his work, spotted her sitting among women at outside of a neighbouring house. He approached towards her. On seeing him, she ran inside. He chased and stabbed her to death. His conviction under Part II and sentence of ﬁve-year rigorous imprisonment was held to be not excessive.340. A group of persons called out the deceased from his home with a view to lodging a protest but suddenly one of them inﬂicted a knife wound which falling on the chest killed the deceased. The Supreme Court convicted the single woundcausing accused under this section saying that the heat of passion generated at the spur of the moment and not any intention to cause death was responsible for the incident.341. In another case of the same kind before the Supreme Court, the ﬁnding was that the wrestler-accused had an altercation with the deceased two or three days before the incident. The prosecution showed that the accused came to the house of the deceased, but suppressed further knowledge about the incident. Drops of blood in the house showed that the deceased was injured there, ran out and fell dead. There was only one major injury. Conviction under Part I of this section was considered to be appropriate.342. Annoyance was caused by the deceased singing a vulgar song. Quarrel and beating in consequence continued for some time. Accused started beating the deceased with a stick not thick enough to cause rupture of the spleen. He might not have had the intention to cause death but had knowledge that death might result. His conviction under section 300 (second) was converted into one under section 304, Part II.343. Where the victim was dragged for about 120 feet and then struck with a crowbar not using much force, the accused knowing that the assault might cause death but not intending it. Part II was held to be attracted and not Part I.344. A person reaching home in a drunken state started beating his wife. Their son intervened and the accused hurled stones on him twice. The boy succumbed to the head injury then and there. Conviction was shifted from under section 302 to 304, Part II, knowledge that death might be caused.345. Persons exceeding the right of private defence are punished under section 304, Part I and not under section 302.346. Where the deceased died due to the negligent ﬁring by a person, who came for celebrating a marriage function with a gun, it was held that though it is not possible to attribute intention, it is equally not possible to hold that the act was done without the knowledge that it is likely to cause death. Everybody, who carries a gun with live cartridges and even others know that ﬁring a gun and that too in the presence of several people is an act, which is likely to cause death. Hence, the liability under section 304, Part II. The appellant caused the death of his wife by beating her with a wooden stick. No intention to cause death was proved. He was convicted under section 304, Part II.347. Where the death of a player was caused by blowing a cricket stump on him in a friendly cricket match and it was found that the accused player did not know that his act would cause an injury which would cause death or which was likely to cause death, it was held that a conviction under section 304, Part II was not proper, but that an offence under section 325 was made out as the injury was caused by a stump which is a blunt weapon.348.   A married woman (25 years) met a sudden death in her matrimonial home. Her letters and complaints spoke of harassment. The medical report put the cause of death as rupture of spleen and pancreas caused by external pressure. Her husband, who was attempting to escape by resorting to the theory of death by poisoning, was found guilty and his conviction under Part II of this section and sentence of ﬁve years of RI was upheld by the Supreme Court. Though he might not have intended to cause death, he did cause an injury about which he must have known that it might cause death.349. Where one of the accused came forward and delivered a blow on the head of a man which proved fatal, the Apex Court was of the view that his act did not attract clause (1) or (3) of section 300 because the accused was armed with no deadly weapon and the head injury was caused by a farmer with an agricultural instrument which he happened to carry with him. Conviction of the accused causing head injury under section 300 was altered to one under section 304, Part II.350. Several persons surrounded a man. Firstly, he was pushed down on the ground and then two injuries were caused to him one each by two assailants one of whom was acquitted. Opinion of the doctor was that the victim died due to shock and haemorrhage resulting from both the injuries. The one injury alone caused by the accused was not individually suﬃcient to cause death. His conviction was altered from section 300 to that under section 304, Part II.351. Where the accused inﬂicted a single knife wound in the abdomen of a man which proved fatal and the opinion of the doctor was that, but for complications, the injury was not suﬃcient to cause death, it was held that the offence did not attract clause (3) of section 300. He was convicted under section 304, Part II.352. A husband, without any history of ill-feeling with his wife, attacked her with the blunt side of an axe and caused a head injury after she fell down of which she died, his conviction under Part I of this section was held to be proper.353. Where a person killed his wife under grave and sudden provocation, a lenient punishment of two years' imprisonment was awarded to him taking into consideration the welfare of his children.354. Where the accused delivered a single stab blow on the chest of his wife out of sheer frustration, momentary impulse and anger, on her refusal to oblige him with sex without any intention to cause her death, his act was held to be culpable homicide not amounting to murder and his conviction was altered from section 302 to section 304, Part I.355. A pregnant woman went to draw water from a well but she was stopped from doing so by several persons armed with 'lathis' and started abusing her and one of them dealt a 'lathi' blow on her head and another kicked her abdomen, as a result she died on the spot and her son who tried to rescue her was also injured. Looking at the conduct of the accused, it could not be said that they had common object to kill the woman or cause injury to her son. Both the assailants were convicted under section 304, Part II and others were acquitted.356. The death of a young boy was caused in a brutal and cruel manner. The trial Court convicted under sections 302/304. The High Court converted it to section 304 without specifying whether the case fell within Part I or II. Sentence of seven years' imprisonment was imposed. The Supreme Court did not interfere.357."

            "sub_section_description": "Where the accused with the intention of obstructing the marriage of his sister with the deceased, gave only one blow which proved fatal and the accused did not repeat the blow though there was nothing to stop him, conviction and sentence of the accused under section 302 was altered to one under section 304, Part I.358. Where the accused under misapprehension that the deceased came to abduct his daughter attacked the deceased with a sharp-edged weapon, without pre-meditation, causing only one injury and he died after three days, conviction of the accused was altered from under section   300 to one under section 304, Part I.359. Where three accused persons assaulted the deceased, one of the accused gave the fatal blow on the victim's head, the second accused caused simple injuries on the knee and arm with spear, and the third gave simple blows, it was held that the ﬁrst accused was liable to be convicted under section 304, Part I, and as section 34 was not applicable, the second was convicted under section 324 and the conviction of the third accused under section 323 was upheld.360. Where most of the injuries found on the body of the deceased were external and on lower legs and on arms, it was held that intention of the accused was to cause grievous hurt and not murder. Conviction of the accused was altered from sections 304/34, Part I to sections 325/34.361.  [s 304.5.1] Death essential to attract section 304.— In Harendra Nath Mandal v State of Bihar the accused caused injury on the head of a man with back portion of his weapon. The injured survived the injury. Still the accused was convicted under section 304, Part I. It was held by the Supreme Court that the accused could not be convicted under section 304 because for the application of section 304, death must have been caused under any of the circumstances mentioned in ﬁve Exceptions of section 300.362.  [s 304.5.2] Exceeding right of private defence.— Whenever accused sustains injuries in the same occurrence and when the injuries are grievous in nature, it is incumbent upon the prosecution to explain the injuries on the person of the accused. The non-explanation of injuries sustained by the accused may give rise to a possibility that the accused has acted in self-defence.363. In a murder case, both the parties sustained injuries in a free ﬁght. The accused received a stab wound on his right shoulder. No explanation of this injury was given by the prosecution. It was held that the accused had caused injuries to the deceased in right of private defence, but that he exceeded his right. He was punished under section 304, Part I and not under section 302.364. In a dispute over possession of land, persons belong to both the sides were injured. The accused were in actual possession at the relevant time. Two of the accused received gunshot injuries. They were held to be entitled to the right of private defence but they exceeded their right. Conviction of the accused under sections 302/149 was altered to one under section 304 Part I.365. In a ﬁght between two groups, the accused ﬁred from a distance killing one person of the other group. Fighting groups were not close enough so as to apprehend immediate danger to anybody's life, when the ﬁring took place. It was held that the accused had exceeded the right of private defence. He was convicted under section 304, Part I.366. Where the accused received injuries at the hands of the deceased and his party, it was held that the accused were entitled to the right of private defence but by using heavy cutting weapons like 'gandasas' and causing serious injuries to the deceased, they had exceeded the right of private defence and were liable to be punished under section 304, Part I but not for murder.367.  [s 304.5.3] Sudden quarrel.— Where as a result of provocation caused in a heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel, the accused chased the deceased to some distance and then gave the single fatal blow, it was held that the whole incident was a continuous sequence. Hence, the   conviction of the accused was shifted from under section 300 to under section 304, Part I.368. Where the accused came to the house at midnight, went to sleep with the deceased but suddenly a quarrel took place and the death occurred on account of asphyxia, the incident occurred all of a sudden, without any premeditation, the accused had not taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner; therefore, his conviction under section 304, Part I of IPC, 1860 was held proper.369."

This is because at any stage of the trial, it would have been open to the concerned Court to have altered the charge appropriately depending on the material that is brought before it in the form of evidence.381. Permissibility to try and convict a person for the offence punishable under section 304, Part II, IPC, 1860 and the offence punishable under section 338, IPC, 1860 for a single act of the same transaction.

In Ramesh Kumar v State of Chhattisgarh,578. the Supreme Court held that where the accused by his acts or by a continued course of conduct creates such circumstances that the deceased was left with no other option but to commit suicide, an \"instigation\" may be inferred. In other words, in order to prove that the accused abetted commission of suicide by a person, it has to be established that (a) the accused kept on irritating or annoying the deceased by words, deeds  or wilful omission or conduct which may even be a wilful silence until the deceased reacted or pushed or forced the deceased by his deeds, words or wilful omission or conduct to make the deceased move forward more quickly in a forward direction, and (b) that the accused had the intention to provoke, urge or encourage the  deceased to commit suicide while acting in the manner noted above. Undoubtedly, presence of mens rea is the necessary concomitant of instigation. Relevantly, it may be mentioned that there is a marked difference between \"intimidatory\" statement and \"instigatory\" statement. \"Intimidatory\" statements may give rise to two types of consequences, (a) either the person to whom such statements are made may be frightened and may be on receiving end or he may be angry enough to retaliate, whereas (b) instigatory statements falls within the category of goading, provoking, etc.579. Abetment involves a mental process of instigating a person or   intentionally aiding a person in doing a thing. Without a positive act on the part of the accused to instigate or aid in committing suicide, conviction cannot be sustained.580."

The intention and involvement of the accused to aid or instigate the commission of suicide is imperative. Any severance or absence of any of this constituents would militate against this indictment. Remoteness of the culpable acts or omissions rooted in the intention of the accused to actualise the suicide would fall short as well of the offence of abetment essential to attract the punitive mandate of section 306, IPC, 1860. Contiguity, continuity, culpability and complicity of the indictable acts or omission are the concomitant indices of abetment. Section 306 IPC, thus criminalises the sustained incitement for suicide.582. In the case of M Mohan v State,583. the Apex Court held that there should be some live link, or a proximate link between the act of the accused and the act of committing of suicide. If the live link is missing, it cannot be said that the accused has instigated, or intentionally aided the commission of suicide. Mere threats of involving the family in a false and frivolous cases cannot be tantamount to instigation.584. Words uttered in a ﬁt of anger or emotion without any intention could not be regarded as an instigation.585.

When the deceased failed to comply with the orders of the accused, the accused became very angry and threatened to suspend the deceased, rebuking him very harshly for not listening to him. The accused also asked the deceased how he still found the will to live, despite being insulted so the driver committed suicide. For the purpose of bringing home any charge, vis-à-vis section 306/107 IPC, 1860 against the accused, Supreme Court stated that there must be allegations to the effect that the accused had either instigated the deceased in some way, to commit suicide or had engaged with some other persons in a conspiracy to do so, or that the accused had in some way aided any act or illegal omission to cause the said suicide. If the making of observations by a superior oﬃcer, regarding the work of his subordinate, is termed as abetment to suicide, it would become almost impossible, for superior oﬃcers to discharge their duties as senior employees. In Vaijnath Kondiba Khandke v State of Maharashtra,606. action was taken against the deceased and his salary was stopped for a month. The Supreme Court held that merely on that count it cannot be said that there was guilty mind or criminal intent to drive a person to commit suicide. That action simplicitor cannot be considered to be pointer against such superior oﬃcer for attracting section 306 IPC, 1860, unless the situation is created deliberately so as to drive a person to commit suicide."

In Chitresh Kumar Chopra v State (Govt of NCT of Delhi),613. the Supreme Court reiterated the legal position laid down in its earlier three Judges Bench judgment in the case of Ramesh Kumar v State of Chhattisgarh,614. and held that where the accused by his acts or continued course of conduct creates such circumstances that the deceased was left with no other option except to commit suicide, an instigation may be inferred. In order to prove that the accused abetted commission of suicide by a person, it has to be established that:— (i) the accused kept on irritating or annoying the deceased by words, deeds or wilful  omission or conduct which may even be a wilful silence until the deceased reacted; or pushed or forced the deceased by his deeds, words or wilful omission or conduct to make the deceased move forward more quickly in a forward direction; and (ii) that the accused had the intention to provoke urge or encourage the deceased  to commit suicide while acting in the manner noted above.

The bride died in her in-laws' home within seven months of her marriage. Evidence ruled out accidental death thus conﬁrming the prosecution version of suicide. As to the question of instigation, Ray J, proceeded as follows:617. The prosecution witnesses clearly testiﬁed to the greedy and lustful nature of the husband and others in that they persistently taunted the deceased and tortured her for not having brought suﬃcient dowry from her father. It is also in evidence that they taunted her for carrying an illegitimate child. All this … caused depression in her mind and drove her to take the extreme step of putting an end to her life by sprinkling kerosene oil on person and setting it aﬁre. Circumstantial evidence (unaccounted delay in providing treatment and informing her parents living not far away) and the evidence of prosecution witnesses clearly proves beyond reasonable doubt that the accused persons instigated and abetted Ravinder Kaur. The ﬁndings arrived at by the High Court without considering the circumstantial evidence as well as the evidence of prosecution witnesses cannot be sustained. As such the ﬁndings of the High Court are liable to be reversed and set aside.   The Supreme Court has reiterated in Wazir Chand v State of Haryana618. that before section 306 can be acted upon, there must be clear proof of the fact that the death in question was a suicidal death. In this case the evidence adduced was not able to justify a ﬁnding of suicide. The only other possibility was accidental burning of the newlymarried woman though she was being victimised for insuﬃcient dowry and there is no chance of an accident being abetted. The husband and in-laws were, however, found guilty under section 498A for causing harassment for dowry."

When death takes place within seven years of her marriage, presumption under section 113A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 springs into action. When the question is whether the commission of suicide by a woman had been abetted by her husband or any relative of her husband and it is shown that she had committed suicide within a period of seven years from the date of her marriage and that her husband or such relative of her husband had subjected her to cruelty, the Court may presume, having regard to all the other circumstances of the case, that such suicide had been abetted by her husband or by such relative of her husband.619. Section 113A only deals with a presumption which the Court may draw in a particular fact situation which may arise when necessary ingredients in order to attract that provision are established. Criminal law amendment and the rule of procedure was necessitated so as to meet the social challenge of saving the married woman from being ill-treated or forcing to commit suicide by the husband or his relatives, demanding dowry. Legislative mandate of the section is that when a woman commits suicide within seven years of her marriage and it is shown that her husband or any relative of her husband had subjected her to cruelty as per the terms deﬁned in section 498A IPC, 1860, the Court may presume having regard to all other circumstances of the case that such suicide has been abetted by the husband or such person. Though a presumption could be drawn, the burden of proof of showing that such an offence has been committed by the accused under section 498A, IPC, 1860 is on the prosecution.620. Once the prosecution succeeds in establishing the component of cruelty leading to a conviction under section 498A, in our view only in a rare case, the Court can refuse to invoke the presumption of abetment, if other requirements of section 113A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 stand satisﬁed.621."

        "section_comments": "Attempt to murder.—This and the following section seem to apply to attempts to murder, in which there has been not merely a commencement of an execution of the purpose, but something little short of a complete execution, the consummation being hindered by circumstances independent of the will of the author. The act or omission, although it does not cause death, is carried to such a length as, at the time of carrying it to that length, the offender considers suﬃcient to cause death.634. The essential ingredients required to be proved in the case of an offence under section 307 are:   (i) that the death of a human being was attempted; (ii) that such death was attempted to be caused by, or in consequence of the act of  the accused; and (iii) that such act was done with the intention of causing death; or that it was done  with the intention of causing such bodily injury as: (a) the accused knew to be likely to cause death; or (b) was suﬃcient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or that the  accused attempted to cause death by doing an act known to him to be so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause (a) death, or (b) such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, the accused having no excuse for incurring the risk of causing such death or injury.635. To justify a conviction under this section, it is not essential that bodily injury capable of causing death should have been inﬂicted. Although the nature of injury actually caused may often give considerable assistance in coming to a ﬁnding as to the intention of the accused, such intention may also be deduced from other circumstances, and may even, in some cases, be ascertained without any reference at all to actual wounds. The section makes a distinction between an act of the accused and its result, if any. Such an act may not be attended by any result so far as the person assaulted is concerned, but still there may be cases in which the culprit would be liable under this section. It is not necessary that the injury actually caused to the victim of the assault should be suﬃcient under ordinary circumstances to cause the death of the person assaulted. What the Court has to see is whether the act, irrespective of its result, was done with the intention or knowledge and under circumstances mentioned in the section. An attempt in order to be criminal need not be the penultimate act. It is suﬃcient in law, if there is present an intent coupled with some over act in execution thereof.636. To bring a case within the ambit of section 307, the prosecution has to make out the facts and circumstances envisaged by section 300. If the ingredients of section 300 are wholly lacking, there can be no conviction under section 307.637. The ingredients of the section are (1) intention or knowledge relating to commission of murder; and (2) the doing of an act towards it.638. The Supreme Court held in Pulicherla Nagaraju v State of AP that: The intention to cause death can be gathered generally from a combination of a few or several of the following, among other, circumstances: (i) nature of the weapon used; (ii) whether the weapon was carried by the accused or was picked up from the spot; (iii) whether the blow is aimed at a vital part of the body; (iv) the amount of force employed in causing injury; (v) whether the act was in the course of sudden quarrel or sudden ﬁght or free for all ﬁght; (vi) whether the incident occurs by chance or whether there was any premeditation; (vii) whether there was any prior enmity or whether the deceased was a stranger; (viii) whether there was any grave and sudden provocation, and if so, the cause for such provocation; (ix) whether it was in the heat of passion; (x) whether the person inﬂicting the injury has taken undue advantage or has acted in a cruel and unusual manner; (xi) whether the accused dealt a single blow or several blows. The above list of circumstances is, of course, not exhaustive and there may be several other special circumstances with reference to individual cases which may throw light on the question of intention.639.  In a group clash, one person died and several others were injured, some of them seriously. The accused also received injuries. Two of the accused were convicted under section 307 and others under section 324. The Supreme Court held that, though the injuries caused by the two accused were somewhat serious, the offence for attempt to murder was not made out as their case stood on the same footing as that of others and altered their conviction to one under section 324.640.",

        "section_comments": "Suicide by itself is not an offence under either English or Indian Criminal Law, though at one time it was a felony in England.664. It is a unique legal phenomenon in the IPC, 1860 that the only act, the attempt of which alone will become an offence. The person who attempts to commit suicide is guilty of the offence under section 309 IPC, 1860 whereas the person who committed suicide cannot be reached at all. Section 306 renders the person who abets the commission of suicide punishable for which the condition precedent is that suicide should necessarily have been committed.665. The act done must be in the course of the attempt, otherwise no offence is committed. Where a woman with the intention of committing suicide by throwing herself in a well, actually ran towards it, when she was seized by a person, it was held that she might have changed her mind, and she was caught before she did anything which might have been regarded as the commencement of the offence.666. Her act simply amounted to preparation. The pounding of oleander roots with an intention to poison oneself with the same was held not to constitute this offence.667. Where the accused jumped into a well to avoid and escape from police, and when rescued he came out of the well of his own accord, it was held that, in the absence of evidence that he jumped into the well to commit suicide, he could not be convicted of this offence.668. A village woman of 20 years old was ill-treated by her husband. There was a quarrel between the two, and the husband threatened that he would beat her. Late that night the woman, taking her six months' old baby in her arms, slipped away from the house. After she had gone some distance she heard somebody coming up behind her, and when she turned round and saw her husband pursuing her, she got into a panic and jumped down a well nearby with the baby in her arms. The result was that the baby died but the woman recovered. One of the charges against her was attempt to commit suicide. It was held that she should not be convicted under this section of an attempt to commit suicide, for the word \"attempt\" connotes some conscious endeavour to accomplish the act, and the accused in jumping down the well was not thinking at all of taking her own life but only of escaping from her husband.669. If a person openly declares that he will fast to death and then proceeds to refuse all nourishment until the stage is reached when there is imminent danger of death ensuing, he can be held guilty under this section but when the evidence falls short of this, it cannot be said to be suﬃcient to sustain the charge.670. A woman who had been suffering from chronic incurable disease retired to bed with her one and a half-year-old child but was found with the child inside a well about 200 feet away from her house in the early morning of the next day when they were both taken out of the well, it was found that though the woman was alive the child had died. On being prosecuted under sections 302 and 309 IPC, 1860, she denied   having jumped into the well. She further pleaded that she was too ill and there was something wrong with her brain. The trial Judge did not give her the beneﬁt of section 84 IPC, 1860 and convicted her of both the offences charged. In acquitting her the High Court of Bombay held that in the absence of any evidence that she deliberately jumped into the well along with the child, she could not be convicted merely on the basis of imagination or denied the beneﬁt of section 84 IPC, 1860. In any case, the Judge should have given her the beneﬁt of doubt.671. Moreover, suspicion however strong is not proof.672. Where a desolate woman jumped into a well with her two children and was released with admonition for the offence under section 309 but was sentenced to imprisonment for three months for the offence under section 307 IPC, 1860, the Supreme Court directed that she should also be released with admonition for the offence under section 307 IPC, 1860.673. Witness clearly stated that deceased was shouting, pleading with the accused to not kill her, when accused gave sword blows to her. There is no material available to establish that deceased volunteered herself for death — Exception 5 to section 300 could not be invoked. Conviction and sentence, as recorded by trial Court under sections 302 and 309 of IPC, 1860 against appellant was held proper.674.",

It added that the act of attempted suicide has no baneful effect on society and it is also not against religion, morality or public policy, besides suicide or attempt to commit it causes no harm to others.

But in Aruna Ramchandra Shanbaug v UOI,685. the Supreme Court held that passive euthanasia can be allowed under exceptional circumstances under the strict monitoring of the Court. The difference between 'active' and passive' euthanasia is that in active euthanasia something is done to end the patient's life while in passive euthanasia, something is not done that would have preserved the patient's life. It is usually deﬁned as withdrawing medical treatment with a deliberate intention to causing the patient's death. In Common Cause (A Regd.

Where the pregnancy is alleged to have been caused by rape or as a result of failure of a contraceptive used by a married woman or her husband, it would be presumed to constitute a grave injury to the mental health of the pregnant woman. The termination of a pregnancy by a person who is not a registered medical practitioner will be an offence under the IPC, 1860, which to that extent is modiﬁed. It is high time that this section too was suitably amended in terms of Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 (34 of 1971) to include the various other grounds on account of which a pregnancy can now be terminated by registered medical practitioner. In this connection see also comment under section 91 ante. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 does not empower the husband, far less his relations, to prevent the concerned woman from causing abortion if her case is covered under section 3 of that Act. Under section 312 of the IPC, 1860 causing miscarriage is a penal offence. Relevant civil law has since been embodied in the Act legalising termination of pregnancy under certain circumstances.

So far as offence punishable under section 315 of the IPC, 1860 is concerned, the offence is committed by a person who before the birth of any child does any act with the intention of thereby preventing that child from being born alive or causing it to die after its birth, and does by such act prevent that child from being born alive, or causes it to die after its birth, if such act be not caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the mother.704. Cognizance taken of the offence under section 315 of IPC, 1860 and the charge framed therein against the petitioner are also not maintainable in view of the fact that no documentary evidence could be collected in course of investigation in support of the allegation that the pregnancy of the prosecutrix was terminated at the instance of the petitioner. She was even not medically examined by the Doctor or the Board of Doctors and there is no medical report in support of the allegation that her pregnancy was ever terminated at any earlier point of time. As the alleged offence under section 315 of the IPC, 1860 relates to termination of pregnancy, such offence may be supported through the medical opinion of the registered practitioner and for want of such prima facie material charge cannot be framed in such section, accordingly the cognizance cannot be taken for the offence under section 315 of the IPC, 1860.705. Intention is one of the major ingredients of sections 315. Wording of section 315 of the IPC, 1860 itself shows that whoever before the birth of any child does any act with the intention of thereby preventing that child from being born alive or causing it to die after its birth, and does by such act prevent that child from being born alive, or causes it to die after its birth, shall, if such act be not caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the mother be punished with imprisonment. In this case the patient was admitted for delivery. During course of delivery there was rupture of uterus which led to bleeding and subsequent death of the patient and the child.

To draw such a line with perfect accuracy is, indeed, absolutely impossible; but it is far better that such a line should be drawn, though rudely, than that offences some of which approach in enormity to murder, while others are little more than frolics which a good-natured man would hardly resent, would be classed together.717.  To make out the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, there must be some speciﬁc hurt, voluntarily inﬂicted, and coming within any of the eight kinds enumerated in this section. Where the injury was caused on the abdomen with a sharp-edged weapon and the doctor stated that the injury was penetrating into the abdominal cavity touching the interior surface of the stomach, not involving any important structure or organ involving danger to life, it was held that the accused had caused simple hurt and not grievous hurt.718. A person cannot be said to have caused grievous hurt unless the hurt caused is one of the kinds of hurt speciﬁed under section 320, IPC, 1860. Therefore, it is the duty of the Court to give a ﬁnding on its own whether the hurt was simple or grievous. The Court is not concerned with the classiﬁcation made by a doctor   as to whether the hurt was simple or grievous. A doctor is to describe the facts in respect of the nature of injury and the Court is to decide whether the nature of the injury described by the doctor comes within any of the clauses of section 320, IPC, 1860.719.",

Some hurts which are not like those hurts which are mentioned in the ﬁrst seven clauses, are obviously distinguished from a slight hurt, may nevertheless be more serious. Thus, a wound may cause intense pain, prolonged disease or lasting injury to the victim, although it does not fall within any of the ﬁrst seven clauses. Before a conviction for the sentence of grievous hurt can be passed, one of the injuries deﬁned in section 320 must be strictly proved, and the eighth clause is no exception to the general rule of law that a penal statute must be construed strictly.723. The line between culpable homicide not amounting to murder and grievous hurt is a very thin line. In the one case the injuries must be such as are likely to cause death; in the other, the injuries must be such as to endanger life.724. An injury can be said to endanger life if it is in itself that it may put the life of the injured in danger.725. The mere fact that a man has been in hospital for 20 days is not suﬃcient; it must be proved that during that time he was unable to follow his ordinary pursuits.726. Where the accused caused hurt to a woman who remained in hospital only for 17 days, out of   which she was in danger for three days, it was held that he had caused grievous hurt.727. A disability for 20 days constitutes grievous hurt: if it continues for a smaller period, then the offence is hurt.728. The two accused persons tied their victim to an electric pole and assaulted him only to teach him a lesson for spreading scandalous information about the alleged love affair of the accused. Their victim died. There was no evidence to attribute any particular overt act to any of them, nor of the intention of any of them to cause death or that any of them was armed with a deadly weapon. It was held that their offence fell within this clause because they endangered the life of their victim and not under section 300 (murder).729. Where the accused persons, after raping a girl of 11 years, thrust a stick into her private part and she died of injuries thereby caused, it was held that while the accused could be convicted under this clause, in the absence of evidence that the injury was suﬃcient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, they could not be convicted under section 302.730."

Where the only intention of the accused who was convicted for the offence of murder was to steal the jewels of the deceased and the only violence which he committed, viz., cutting the nostrils of the deceased, was necessary in order to facilitate the theft and the death of the deceased was entirely unexpected, it was held that the accused was not guilty of murder but of causing grievous hurt under section 325.731.

The accused husband returned home at midnight in a drunken state. He beat his wife and threw a piece of stone on her head and she died. The post-mortem report revealed three simple injuries on her head and exact cause of death could not be ascertained. Relations between the accused and the deceased were found to be cordial. Intention to cause the victim's death was not proved. Conviction of the accused under section 300 was set aside and he was convicted under section 323.749. Several persons attacked and caused the death of their victim. All, including the present appellant, were holding the deceased and one of them K dealt fatal blows. K was convicted of murder under section 302. All his fellows were convicted under this section read with section 149 except the present appellant who was convicted under section 302 read with section 34. The Supreme Court held that the appellant should also have been convicted under this section read with section 149.750. Thomas v State of Kerala,751. the ﬁst blow caused by the accused resulted in subdural haematoma which led to the death of the victim, but it could not be said that the accused could be attributed with the knowledge that by such act he was likely to cause death, nor could it be said that the accused intended to cause that particular injury which he actually caused, it was held that accused could be convicted only under section 323 and not section 300. In Mohan Singh v State of Rajasthan,752. the accused attacked his victim and caused voluntary hurt to him by inﬂicting ﬁst blows and causing nose injury. His guilt was established by the evidence of the witnesses. The plea of alibi raised by the accused was not tenable. His conviction under section 323 was upheld. Where the offence was punishable under this section and also under sections 304, Part II/34, and was covered by the Uttar Pradesh Children Act, 1951, the Court did not consider it proper to subject children to imprisonment but, looking at the brutal nature of the offence, imposed a sentence of ﬁne.753. Where the accused brothers chanced to converge, having not met before, at their sister's place avowedly to teach her a lesson for having instituted proceedings against them and one of them who, not known to others was carrying a knife, inﬂicted a knife blow which, landing on a vital part, caused death, they were convicted under this section and the knife wielding brother under section 304 Part-II.754. In a case of attempt to murder, one of the accused gave only one blow with a 'lathi' on the shoulder of the injured without sharing the common intention of the other accused. Injury was simple and caused only swelling. He was convicted for his individual act under section 323 and was released on probation.755."

Where in a quarrel the accused kicked the deceased on his testicles but as no medical treatment was given for two days, the injured died due to Toxaemia caused by gangrene. The injury to the testicles was not the direct cause of his death. The Supreme Court set aside his conviction under section 304 Part II and convicted him under section 323 instead.757. In a dispute over land the defence of accused regarding exercising of private defence was not accepted. Sentence of accused under section 304, Part II was maintained. Other accused were convicted under section 323 IPC, 1860.758. The accused, a police constable, beat up a frail old man of 60 years weighing only 38 Kg. His ribs were broken and that resulted in his death. The Court said that the accused must have intended the consequences of his act. His conviction was altered from under section 323 to section 304, Part II. The incident had become 15 years old. He had already served some portion of his punishment.

Where a head injury was caused with a deadly weapon and the injured was discharged from the hospital after 15 days, but six months thereafter he had to be hospitalised again for brain operation and he did not recover, the death being not solely due to the injury, the accused persons convicted under this section and their conviction under section 304 was set aside.767. Tooth is an instrument of cutting and as such biting off the tip of the nose would be an offence under this section or section 326 IPC, 1860 depending on the nature of the injury, simple or grievous.768. Where there is no serious injury on any vital part of the body of the victim, the offender should be convicted under section 324 and not under section 326 IPC, 1860.769. Thus, where the accused inﬂicted an injury on the right shoulder of the deceased with a broken soda water bottle with sharp edges without knowing that the deceased was suffering from haemophilia (tendency of excessive bleeding), it was held that the accused was liable only under section 324 and not under section 302 IPC, 1860.770. Where simple injuries not likely to cause death were inﬂicted with a sword, the Supreme Court transferred the conviction from under section 307 to one under this section and allowed the offences to be compounded on payment to the victim a sum of Rs. 3,000.771. Where in a case of a dowry death, the evidence showed that the accused, mother-in-law caused injuries on   the person of the daughter-in-law. She committed suicide. The accused was punished under section 324 but on consideration of circumstances and facts that she was 80, only a sentence of ﬁne of Rs. 3,000 was imposed. Offence under section 306 was not made out.772. Where the accused, a boy of 18 years of age at the time of incident having no criminal history, in a sudden scuﬄe gave a blow on the chest of the deceased with an ordinary knife resulting in his death and thereafter, mutely allowed to take the knife from his hand and went to the hospital along with the deceased, it was held that he had no intention to cause death or grievous hurt to the deceased, and was guilty under section 324 and not under section 304, Part II.773. Where the accused assaulted his victim by 'Katti' blow causing grievous hurt and the co-accused assaulted the victim only by lathis and hands causing minor injuries and no pre-concert between the accused and the co-accused regarding the assault by the 'Katti' was established, it was held that the co-accused could not be vicariously held liable for the acts of the accused and be convicted under section 324.774. Where a blow was inﬂicted with the blunt side of the axe on the thigh of the victim, the Supreme Court reduced the sentence to four months' RI and increased the ﬁne to Rs. 3,000.775. Where the accused deliberately attacked and killed a person with a deadly weapon and was held to be rightly convicted for murder under section 300, he was convicted under this section and sentenced to pay a ﬁne for causing hurt on the hand of the intervening wife of the deceased with a rice pounder.776. In a free ﬁght between two groups resulting in death of one person and injuries to several others, fatal injury could not be attributed to any one of the accused who also received a number of injuries. It was held that the accused were properly convicted under sections 324 and 325.777. Where one of the accused caused two gunshot injuries to a man which proved fatal, the other accused caused him only an incised injury. The accused causing fatal injuries was sentenced under section 302 and the other accused only under section 324.778. In an altercation the accused dealt a blow with spade lying on the spot on the head of a 70-year-old man who became unconscious, was hospitalised and died after three weeks. The blow caused only linear fracture of left frontal bone. It was found that essential element of voluntarily causing grievous hurt was wanting. It was held that his offence fell under section 324 and not under section 326.779. Allegation that accused resorted to repeated ﬁrings at two persons on two occasions at two different times and place. On ﬁrst occasion accused ﬁred in air and pellets after being ricocheted from ceiling caused simple injuries to three persons. On second occasion also appellant had not caused any injury to anybody. In view of dearth of convincing evidence on record, it cannot be concluded with any degree of certainty that appellant had an intention to commit murder of anybody. Only conclusion could be drawn is that appellant wanted to cause hurt for dispersing crowd. Appellant can only be convicted under section 324 of IPC, 1860 and not under section 307 IPC, 1860.780. Medical evidence that injuries, however, serious in nature but not grievous in nature. Skin grafting has been done and victim is ﬁt for discharge — Accused is guilty of offence under section 324 IPC, 1860 and not under section 307 IPC, 1860.781. The accused struck his wife once only on the neck causing simple injury. She fell down and was further injured and died. The instrument (wooden reaper) was dangerous.

The facts involved in a particular case, depending upon various factors like size, sharpness, would throw light on the question whether the weapon was a dangerous or deadly weapon or not. That would determine whether in the case section 325 or section 326 would be applicable. Considering the size of the stone which was used, as revealed by material on record, it cannot be said that a dangerous weapon was used. Therefore, the conviction was altered to section 325 IPC, 1860.793. Where a player in a friendly cricket match blew a stump against another player which hit his head and caused death, it was held that the intention to cause death or likelihood of it being not proved, an offence under section 325 was made out, injury having been caused by a blunt weapon.794. Where medical evidence showed that attack on the forehead of the deceased was by a lathi and the internal injury could not be correlated to the external injury caused by the accused, it was held that the accused was liable under section 325 IPC, 1860 and not under section 304, Part II, IPC, 1860.795. Where two injuries were caused in a quarrel by the two accused persons each of whom inﬂicted one stick blow one of which proved fatal but it could not be known who had inﬂicted that blow and since intention to cause death was not established, conviction was altered from under section 302 to section 325 read with section 34.796. In a ﬁght between two groups, one person received one stick blow on the head and died a week after treatment and operation. It could not be said that the accused had knowledge that blow would cause death of that person. Conviction of the accused under section 304 Part II/34 was altered to one under sections 325 and 34.797. In an altercation between father and the son, the son gave a blow on the head of his father with a heavy stick and ran away. The victim died after one week in the hospital.

In a case the victim had sustained a grievous injury on a vital portion of the body and the injury was life threatening, imposition of sentence of six days only, which was the period already undergone by the accused in conﬁnement was held too lenient.

In a clash over property dispute the accused party caused grievous injuries to two persons and simple injuries to some   others. The occurrence took place 17 years before and some of the accused were more than 76 years of age and one of them had died. Their conviction under section 325 was aﬃrmed but the sentence was reduced to the period already undergone as the Court did not think it ﬁt to send them back to jail. However, a ﬁne of Rs. 200 was imposed on each one of them.800.

As was noted by the Supreme Court in State of UP v Indrajeet alias Sukhatha,807. there is no such thing as a regular or earmarked weapon for committing murder or for that matter a hurt. Whether a particular article can per se cause any serious wound or grievous hurt or injury has to be determined factually. At this juncture, it would be relevant to note that in some provisions, e.g., sections 324 and 326 expression \"dangerous weapon\" is used. In some other more serious offences the expression used is \"deadly weapon\" (e.g., sections 397 and 398). The facts involved in a particular case, depending upon various factors like size, sharpness, would throw light on the question whether the weapon was a dangerous or   deadly weapon or not. That would determine whether in the case section 325 or section 326 would be applicable.808. In the absence of any evidence that the stick which was used as a weapon of offence was of lethal type and something like sharp blade or sharp point, etc., was attached to it, the stick was held to be not an instrument within the meaning of this section.809. Where the accused-teacher assaulted the child-student with a wooden stick that caused injury to the eye of the child but there was no material to show that the stick that was wielded by the accused was a dangerous weapon, the conviction of the accused under section 326 may not be warranted; but the offence would fall under section 325 IPC, 1860.810."

Supreme Court allowed the compounding of an offence under section 326 IPC, 1860 even though such compounding was not permitted by section 320 of the Code. However, in Surendra Nath Mohanty v State of Orissa,835. and in Ramlal v State of Jammu and Kashmir,836. it was held that an offence which law declares to be non-compoundable cannot be compounded at all even with the permission of the Court and held Suresh Babu,837. per incuriam. In Jalaluddin v State of UP,838. and in Bankat v State,839. the Apex Court reiterated that as the offence under section 326, IPC, 1860 is not compoundable, even if the parties settled the matter. In Ramgopal v State of MP,840. Supreme Court held as follows: There are several offences under the IPC that are currently non - compoundable. These include offences punishable u/s. 498-A, s. 326, etc. of the IPC. Some of such offence can be made compoundable by introducing a suitable amendment in the statute. We are of the opinion that the Law Commission of India could examine whether a suitable proposal can be sent to the Union Government in this regard. Any such step would not only relieve the Courts of the burden of deciding cases in which the aggrieved parties have themselves arrived at a settlement, but may also encourage the process of reconciliation between them. We, accordingly, request the Law Commission and the Government of India to examine all these aspects and take such steps as may be considered feasible.  The Law Commission of India examined the issue in view of the direction in Ramgopal's Case and submitted its 237th Report suggesting to make section 498A and section 324 compoundable: no changes were suggested regarding section 326. In Gian Singh v State of Punjab,841. a three-Judge Bench held that sub-section (9) of section 320 mandates that no offence shall be compounded except as provided by this section. Obviously, in view thereof the composition of an offence has to be in accord with section 320 and in no other manner. But the power of compounding of offences given to a Court under section 320 is materially different from the quashing of criminal proceedings by the High Court in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction. In compounding of offences, power of a criminal Court is circumscribed by the provisions contained in section 320 and the Court is guided solely and squarely thereby while, on the other hand, the formation of opinion by the High Court for quashing a criminal offence or criminal proceeding or criminal complaint is guided by the material on record as to whether the ends of justice would justify such exercise of power although the ultimate consequence may be acquittal or dismissal of indictment. The result is, though section 326 IPC, 1860 is a non-compoundable offence, the High Court can quash the   proceedings by using its inherent power under section 482 Cr PC, 1973 in case of settlement between the parties."

Disturbed by this situation the Law Commission in its 113th Report recommended amendments to the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 so as to provide that in the prosecution of a police oﬃcer for an alleged offence of having caused bodily injuries to a person while in police custody, if there is evidence that the injury was caused during the period when the person was in the police custody, the Court may presume that the injury was caused by the police oﬃcer having the custody of that person during that period unless the police oﬃcer proves to the contrary. The onus to prove the contrary must be discharged by the police oﬃcial concerned. Keeping in view the dehumanising aspect of the crime, the ﬂagrant violation of the fundamental rights of the victim of the crime and the growing rise in the crimes of this type, where only a few come to light and others don't, the Government and the legislature must give serious thought to the recommendation of the Law Commission and bring about the appropriate changes in the law not only to curb the custodial crime but also to see that the custodial crime does not go unpunished. The Courts are also required to have a change in their outlook approach, appreciation and attitude, particularly in cases involving custodial crimes and they should exhibit more sensitivity and adopt a realistic rather than a narrow technical approach, while dealing with the cases of custodial crime so that as far as possible within their powers, the truth is found and guilty should not escape so that the victim of the crime has the satisfaction that ultimately the majesty of law has prevailed.861.

On the other hand, if hurt was voluntarily caused to a public   servant, while not discharging his duty as a public servant, it is necessary to prove that hurt was caused with intent to prevent or deter that person or any other public servant from discharging his duty. Alternatively, if hurt was voluntarily caused to a public servant, while he was discharging his oﬃcial duty as such public servant, it is not necessary to establish further that it was so caused with the intention to prevent or deter that person from discharging his duty as such public servant. On the other hand, even if hurt was caused voluntarily to a public servant, if he was not discharging his duty as a public servant at that time, it is necessary to prove additionally that hurt was caused to prevent or deter that person from discharging his duty as a public servant.869. Where a public servant was assaulted due to an earlier private quarrel, the assault having no causal connection with the duty of the public servant, the accused could not be held liable under section 332 IPC, 1860. His conviction was, therefore, changed to one under section 323 IPC, 1860.870. Accused/appellant cut the hose pipe from the train and assaulted the complainant/ constable when he questioned the act. According to them, the accused/appellant and other accused persons had gone to the extent of pulling down the complainant from the train and when he was taken to the guardroom, they were shouting at him threatening to throw him on the railway track. Offence was clearly made out.871. Where the accused persons entered the premises of a government school and abused, humiliated and voluntarily caused hurt to deter the Head Master of the school from his duty and they abused the other teachers also, the Court did not interfere with their conviction under section 332.872.",

The basic differences between sections 333 and 325 IPC, 1860 are that section 325 gets attracted where grievous hurt is caused, whereas section 333 gets attracted if such hurt is caused to a public servant.875. Complainant had sustained grievous hurt while he was on patrolling duty. He was questioning the unauthorised parking of a pickup van. He was taken inside the van then kicked and punched. Witnesses corroborated each other on material particulars. Conviction was upheld.876.

It was held that it amounted to preventing and deterring a public servant, from acting in lawful discharge of his duty and the accused was liable to be convicted under section 333.878.",

(2) The obstruction must be such as to prevent that person from proceeding in any  direction in which he has a right to proceed. The word 'voluntary' is signiﬁcant. It connotes that obstruction should be direct. The obstructions must be a restriction on the normal movement of a person. It should be a physical one. They should have common intention to cause obstruction.909. The following illustrations, given in the original Draft Code,910. further elucidate the meaning of this section:— (a) A builds a wall across a path along which Z has a right to pass. Z is thereby  prevented from passing. A wrongfully restrains Z. (b) A illegally omits to take proper order with a furious buffalo which is in his  possession and thus voluntarily deters Z from passing along a road along which   Z has a right to pass. A wrongfully restrains Z. (c) A threatens to set a savage dog at Z, if Z goes along a path along which Z has a  right to go. Z is thus prevented from going along that path. A wrongfully restrains Z. (d) In the last illustration, if the dog is not really savage, but if A voluntarily causes Z  to think that it is savage, and thereby prevents Z from going along the path, A wrongfully restrains Z. From these illustrations it will appear that a person may obstruct another by causing it to appear to that other that it is impossible, diﬃcult or dangerous to proceed, as well as by causing it actually to be impossible, diﬃcult or dangerous for that other to proceed. For the offence of wrongful restraint, the necessary pre-condition is that the person concerned must have a right to proceed.911. It is an inevitable factor under section 339 of the IPC, 1860 which deﬁnes wrongful restraint that the person, who is obstructed, has the right to proceed in a particular direction. If section 339 and section 31 are read together, it will be clear that if the accused voluntarily obstructs any person so as to prevent that person from proceeding in any direction in which that person has right to proceed, he is said to have wrongfully restrained that person. Section 339 of the IPC, 1860 requires that the accused should have obstructed a person from proceeding in any direction in which he has the right to proceed and when he obstructs any person and restrains him from proceeding in any direction he commits the offence of wrongful restraint punishable under section 341 of the IPC, 1860.912. Whoever obstructs a person from proceeding to a direction to which that person has a right to proceed, commits an offence of wrongful restraint. While dealing with the offence which is punishable under section 341 of IPC, 1860 and which has been deﬁned by section 339 of IPC, 1860 the Court is obliged to see following ingredients: (1) Whether the person so obstructed had a lawful right to proceed to a direction to  which he has been obstructed; (2) Whether such obstruction was for enforcement of a legal right of the obstructer. (3) Whether such obstructer obstructed such person in good faith. It has to be kept  in mind that nothing can be said to be done in good faith which is not done with due care and caution. If these ingredients are indicated by the complaint, the Magistrate is obliged to take the cognizance of the complaint so presented before him unless there are the other grounds for acting otherwise which has to be justiﬁed by reasons recorded in writing.913. Where the tenant and his family members were prevented by some other tenants in league with the landlord from using the main gate by force and abuses, the Court observed that it was utterly wrong to have dismissed the complaint as a matter of civil nature.914. Obstruction contemplated by this section, though physical, may be caused not only by physical force but also by menaces and threats, the criterion of the offence thereunder or under section 341 being more the effect than the method.915. The fact of physical obstruction even by mere words would fall within the ambit of this section.916."

Where a tenant was partially obstructed from entering the premises by the closure of one of the door leaves, it was held that it did not amount to wrongful restraint as he was still free to enter the premises.923. The wife of the complainant was working as a teacher in a school. The complainant, a judicial oﬃcer, was staying in the quarter allotted to her in the school compound till he was posted to some other place. Thereafter, he used to visit his family and was permitted to park his car at a particular place but he was prevented from using the main gates of the school. He was not restrained from using the passage leading to the school premises where his wife was allotted residential quarter. It was held that criminal restraint to a 'person' is punishable but not any obstruction for plying/parking of a vehicle at a particular place.924.

In this case, the accused person had decided on behalf of a limited company to get a road repaired and the repair, if carried out, might have caused some inconvenience to the complainant, it was held that there was no offence under sections 339 and 341.926."

When a minor is kept against the will of the person, who has the custody of such a child and/or who is entitled to take the custody of the child, such detention would amount to 'wrongful conﬁnement'. In such a case, it is the will of the person, who is entitled to have custody of such a child, which will be the will of the child, for, the child's willingness or 'consent' would be immaterial unless the welfare of the child, in a given case, demands removal of the child from the custody of the person, who is, otherwise, entitled to keep the custody of the child.

A wrongful conﬁnement is a wrongful restraint in such a manner as to prevent that person from proceeding beyond a certain circumscribed limits. This offence has nothing to do with the investigation or search.949. The essential ingredients of the offence \"wrongful conﬁnement\" are that the accused should have wrongfully conﬁned the complainant and such restraint was to prevent the complainant from proceeding beyond certain circumscribed limits beyond which he/she has a right to proceed. The factual scenario clearly establishes commission by the appellant as well of the offence punishable under section 342 IPC, 1860.950. Conﬁnement need not necessarily be a conﬁnement where the person is physically held within a certain circumscribed limit. To support the charge of wrongful conﬁnement, proof of actual physical obstruction is not essential. It is the condition of the mind of the person conﬁned, having regard to the circumstances that leads him to reasonably believe that he was not free to move and that he would be forthwith restrained if he attempted to do so.951. Where a man, illegally taken into police custody was beaten by the police and he committed suicide, the accused police oﬃcials were punished under section 342. Case under sections 352 and 302 was not made out.952. Wife suffered a blow of hammer on left side below ear and immediately died on spot. Accused husband convicted under section 342 and 302 IPC, 1860.953. Victim after being arrested was kept in police station for three days and was not produced before a Magistrate within 24 hours. SHO cannot be absolved from the charges under section 342.954. In Vadamalai v Syed Thastha Keer,955. the complainant was allegedly detained and beaten by appellant/police oﬃcials in Police Station but the evidence does not show that he was kept in police station for four days. Conviction of the appellant by High Court under sections 323, 342 held not sustainable and liable to be set aside. The oﬃcers who visited the house of the accused for making inquiry under Money Lenders Act, were not allowed to go out of the house for some time. It was found that there was no apprehension in their mind about use of force in case they tried to move out. It was held that no offence under section 342 was made out.956.",

        "section_comments": "The preceding section deﬁnes 'force'. This section says that 'force' becomes criminal (1) when it is used without consent and in order to the committing of an offence, or (2) when it is intentionally used to cause injury, fear or annoyance to another to whom the force is used. To attract the deﬁnition of 'criminal force' under section 350 IPC, 1860, there must be intentional use of force on any person, without that person's consent. Such force must have been used for committing an offence, or intending to cause, or knowing it to be likely that by the use of such force he will cause injury, fear or annoyance to the person on whom the force is used. In other words, the criminal force contemplated under this section is intended to mean criminal force as applied to a person and not as applied to an inanimate object or substance.962. A person is said to use force when he causes motion or change of motion or cessation of motion to another person or the above in substance, which brings it into contact with any part of the other person's body or with anything that the other is wearing or carrying, or with anything so situated that such contact affects other's sense of feeling. This should be done by his own bodily power or by use of some substance or by inducing any animal to change this motion. The use of force will become criminal when it is done against the consent of any person with the intention of committing an offence or to cause injury, fear or annoyance to any person. In this case admittedly no assault was resorted to.963. The term 'criminal force' includes what in English law is called 'battery'. It will, however, be remembered that 'criminal force' may be so slight as not to amount to an offence (section 95), and it will be observed that 'criminal force' does not include anything that the doer does by means of another person. The deﬁnition of 'criminal force' is so wide as to include force of almost every description of which a person is the ultimate object.",

Similarly, where a forest oﬃcer who was authorised to arrest a person only when the offence was committed within ﬁve miles of the border arrested the accused when there was no evidence that the offence was committed within the ﬁve mile belt, it was held that the arrest not being justiﬁed, the accused did not commit any offence under this section by inﬂicting some injuries on the oﬃcer during a scuﬄe.987.

The accused suspected that the complainant public servant was instrumental in his transfer. The complainant was proceeding to his oﬃce to resume his duty. On the way he was assaulted by the accused. It was held that no offence was committed under section 353 because the public servant was not assaulted to deter him from discharge of his duty.995. The wife of the accused was being taken to Police Station in execution of search warrant accompanied by a police constable. The accused attacked his wife and also the police constable.

But under section 353, there must be in addition to the obstruction use of criminal force or assault to the public servant while he was discharging his duty. It may also be noted that the quality of the two offences is also different. While section 186 occurs in Chapter X dealing with contempt of the lawful authority of public servants, section 353 appears in Chapter XVI which deals with offences affecting the human body.

In its application to the State of Andhra Pradesh, for section 354 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, the following section shall be substituted namely—",
        "section_comments": "The provisions of section 354 IPC, 1860 has been enacted to safeguard public morality and decent behaviour. Therefore, if any person uses criminal force upon any woman with the intention or knowledge that the woman's modesty will be outraged, he is to be punished. In Vishaka v State of Rajasthan,1001. and Apparel Export Promotion Council v AK Chopra,1002. the Supreme Court held that the offence relating to modesty of woman cannot be treated as trivial. In order to constitute the offence under section 354, IPC, 1860 mere knowledge that the modesty of a woman is likely to be outraged is suﬃcient without any deliberate intention of such outrage alone for its object. There is no abstract conception of modesty that can apply to all cases. A careful approach has to be adopted by the Court while dealing with a case alleging outrage of modesty. The essential ingredients of the offence under section 354, IPC, 1860 are as under: (1) That the person assaulted must be a woman. (2) Accused must have used criminal force on her intending thereby to outrage her  modesty. (3) What constitutes an outrage to female modesty is nowhere deﬁned—The  essence of a woman's modesty is her sex. (4) Act of pulling a woman, removing her dress coupled with a request for sexual  intercourse, as such would be an outrage to the modesty of a woman. (5) Knowledge, that modesty is likely to be outraged, is suﬃcient to constitute the  offence without any deliberate intention of having such outrage alone for its object.1003. Intention is not the sole criterion of the offence punishable under section 354, IPC, 1860 and it can be committed by a person assaulting or using criminal force to any woman, if he knows that by such act the modesty of the woman is likely to be affected. Knowledge and intention are essentially things of the mind and cannot be demonstrated like physical objects. The existence of intention or knowledge has to be culled out from various circumstances in which and upon whom the alleged offence is alleged to have been committed.1004. Even though it is true that assault or criminal force to woman is one of the essential pre-conditions for applicability of section 354 IPC, 1860 but the same has to be with an intent to outrage her modesty or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby outrage her modesty. Neither the use of criminal force alone nor act of outraging the modesty alone is suﬃcient to attract an offence under section 354 IPC, 1860.1005.",

            "sub_section_description": "The essence of a woman's modesty is her sex. The culpable intention of the accused is the crux of the matter. The reaction of the woman is very relevant, but its absence is not always decisive. Modesty is an attribute associated with female human beings as a   class. It is virtue which attaches to a family owing to her sex. The ultimate test for ascertaining whether the modesty of a woman has been outraged, assaulted or insulted is that the action of the offender should be such that it may be perceived as one which is capable of shocking the sense of decency of a woman. A person slapping on the posterior of a woman in full public glare would amount to outraging her modesty for it was not only an affront to the normal sense of feminine decency but also an affront to the dignity of the lady. The word \"modesty\" is not to be interpreted with reference to the particular victim of the act, but as an attribute associated with female human beings as a class. It is a virtue which attaches to a female on account of her sex.1006. In State of Punjab v Major Singh,1007., a three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court considered the question — Whether modesty of a female child of seven and half months can also be outraged. The majority view was in the aﬃrmative. Bachawat, J, on behalf of majority, opined as: The offence punishable u/s. 354 is an assault on or use of criminal force to a woman with the intention of outraging her modesty or with the knowledge of the likelihood of doing so. The Code does not deﬁne 'modesty'. What then is a woman's modesty? … The essence of a woman's modesty is her sex. The modesty of an adult female is written large on her body. Young or old, intelligent or imbecile, awake or sleeping, the woman possesses a modesty capable of being outraged. Whoever uses criminal force to her with intent to outrage her modesty commits an offence punishable u/s. 354. The culpable intention of the accused is the crux of the matter. The reaction of the woman is very relevant, but its absence is not always decisive, as, for example, when the accused with a corrupt mind stealthily touches the ﬂesh of a sleeping woman. She may be an idiot, she may be under the spell of anaesthesia, she may be sleeping, she may be unable to appreciate the signiﬁcance of the act; nevertheless, the offender is punishable under the section.1008.  An indecent assault upon a woman is punished under this section. Rape is punished under section 376; but the offence under this section is of less gravity than rape.1009. Knowledge that modesty is likely to be outraged has been held to be suﬃcient to constitute the offence without any deliberate intention to outrage modesty. In this case the victim woman was brought into a room under false pretexts, the room was locked from outside, inside she was forced to drink, photographs taken in naked state and raped. All the participants were held to be guilty of outraging her modesty.1010. A person who is guilty of attempting rape cannot be allowed to escape with the lesser penalty of this section. Where the accused walked into the room where a female child of seven and a half months was sleeping and committed an indecent assault on the child, he was held to have committed an offence under this section as he had outraged and intended to outrage whatever modesty the little victim was capable of.1011. Their Lordships of the House of Lords have pointed out that a person is guilty of indecent assault if he intentionally assaults the victim and intends to commit not just an assault but an indecent assault, i.e., an assault which right-minded persons would think is indecent. Accordingly, any evidence explaining the defendant's conduct, whether an admission by him or otherwise, is admissible to establish whether he intended to commit an indecent assault. In this case,1012. a 26-year-old shop assistant pulled a 12year-old girl visitor to the shop across his knees and smacked her with his hand 12 times on her bottom outside her shorts for no apparent reason. On being asked he explained his weakness as \"buttock fetish\". But for this admission there was nothing to convert the assault (to which he confessed) into an indecent one. His explanation to his secret motive was held to be relevant to hold him guilty of indecent assault. Moreover, according to section 10, IPC, 1860 a woman denotes a female human being of any age. Where the woman is a consenting party there cannot be any outraging of modesty.1013. Unless culpable intention is proved mere touching the belly of a female in a public bus cannot be called a deliberate act of outraging the modesty of a female within the meaning of this section. In the circumstances of the case the act of the accused was held to be accidental and not intentional.1014. Where the accused caught hold of a married woman and tried to open the string of her salwar with a view to committing rape on her but being hit by the woman with a kulhari ﬂed away, it was held that he could not be convicted under section 376 read with section 511 IPC, 1860 as   his action did not show a determination to have sexual intercourse at all events and in spite of resistance. The conviction of the accused was accordingly changed to one under section 354, IPC, 1860.1015. Where the allegation was, while the victim was returning from home, the accused came from behind and pressed her breast, the Court convicted him under section 354 IPC, 1860.1016. The accused came from behind her and caught hold of her and laid her down on the cot and sat on her chest. She shouted and after that the accused left her house. After hearing her shouts, her cousin mother-in-law came there. High Court rejected the defence of false implication and convicted the accused under section 354, IPC, 1860.1017. Where a married woman alleged that the two accused persons had dragged her in her own home and raped her one after the other and the medical evidence showed that though there were traces of semen on her clothes, there were none on the clothes of the accused persons, the Court opined that the case was not made out; the presence of semen on the clothes of a married woman is not unusual and therefore, the accused could have been prosecuted only for outraging the modesty of a woman.1018. Some labourers, including a woman, were taken to a police station for some work. When they demanded wages, they were beaten up. The woman was stripped bare and thrashed. The matter came before the Supreme Court in a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court held that the offence under section 354, IPC, 1860 was established in reference to the woman and awarded compensation to be recovered from the salary of the guilty oﬃcers.1019. The offence was held to have been made out where a senior police oﬃcer slapped the posterior of the prosecutrix in the midst of guests in a party. The accused must have been fully aware that such an act would embarrass her and outrage her modesty. She made hue and cry immediately. Her conduct did not suggest that she was stage-managing things to malign the accused. The Court observed such behaviour was not expected from a high-ranked police oﬃcer. His conviction for the offence under the section was maintained by the Supreme Court.1020."

Offence committed by accused did not amount to attempt to commit rape punishable under section 376 read with section 511 of IPC, 1860 but was one under section 354.1022. Though there was ample evidence that the victim was disrobed by the accused and thus the accused, outraged her modesty there was no evidence of rape. Conviction under section 376 was altered to section 354.1023. But in State of UP v Rajit Ram1024. the Supreme Court set aside a judgment by which a conviction under section 376 was altered to section 354 and   remitted the case back to trial court. The accused in another case had forcibly laid the prosecutrix on the bed and broken her pyjama's string but made no attempt to undress himself and when the prosecutrix pushed him away, he did not make efforts to grab her again. It was held that it was not an attempt to rape but only outraging of the modesty of a woman and conviction under section 354 was proper.1025. But in Ram Mehar v State of Haryana,1026. the accused caught hold of the prosecutrix, lifted her and then took her to a bajra ﬁeld where, he pinned her down and tried to open her salwar but could not do so as the prosecutrix had injured him by giving a sickle blow. The accused failed to give his blood sample with the result it could be presumed that his innocence was doubtful. Ocular evidence of the prosecutrix was also corroborated by other evidence. It was held that conviction of the accused under sections 354, 376/511 was proper. The accused caught the victim from behind, pushed her on ground, removed her panty and attempted rape. Upon getting opportunity she kicked him in testicles and escaped from place of occurrence. The accused was convicted under section 511 read with section 376.1027."

            "sub_section_description": "The Supreme Court considered the interpretation of expression 'takes or entices' in S Varadarajan v State of Madras,1058. and State of Haryana v Rajaram.1059. The purpose and object of section 361 IPC, 1860 appears to be in dispute. In Varadarajan, the Supreme Court had occasion to consider this. In section 498 IPC, 1860 we ﬁnd identical expression 'takes or entices' employed by the legislature. That was of course for a totally different offence. While considering the object of section 361 IPC, 1860, the Supreme Court in Varadarajan, took the view that the interpretation of the expression 'takes or entices' in section 498 IPC, 1860 cannot be blindly and mechanically imported while considering the interpretation of the same expression in section 361 IPC, 1860. It took the view that section 498 IPC, 1860 is meant essentially for protection of the rights of the husband, whereas section 361 IPC, 1860 and other cognate sections of the IPC, 1860 are intended more for the protection of minors and persons of unsound mind than the rights of the guardians of such persons. But in Rajaram, the Supreme Court held that: The object of this section seems as much to protect the minor children from being seduced for improper purposes as to protect the rights and privileges of guardians having the lawful charge or custody of their minor wards. The gravamen of this offence lies in the taking or enticing of a minor under the ages speciﬁed in this section, out of the keeping of the lawful guardian without the consent of such guardian. The words 'takes or entices any minor … out of the keeping of the lawful guardian of such minor' in S. 361, are signiﬁcant. The use of the word 'keeping' in the context connotes the idea of charge, protection, maintenance and control: further the guardian's charge and control appears to be compatible with the independence of action and movement in the minor, the guardian's protection and control of the minor being available, whenever necessity arises. On plain reading of this section the consent of the minor who is taken or enticed is wholly immaterial: it is only the guardian's consent which takes the case out of its purview. Nor is it necessary that the taking or enticing must be shown to have been by means of force or fraud. Persuasion by the accused person which creates willingness on the part of the minor to be taken out of the keeping of the lawful guardian would be suﬃcient to attract the section.  A person who allows such a minor who is already out of the keeping of the guardian to accompany him commits no offence under section 361 IPC, 1860. That alone is the dictum in Varadarajan. It is no authority on the question whether consent of a minor (even a knowledgeable minor close to 18 years) is relevant or crucial in a prosecution under section 361 IPC, 1860. Later a two-Judge Bench in T D Vadgama v State of Gujarat,1060. ascertained the precise distinction in the dictum between the three-Judge Benches in Varadarajan and Rajaram. The dictum in Varadarajan turned on its own peculiar facts. It was held: it would, however, be suﬃcient if the prosecution establishes that though immediately prior to the minor leaving the father's protection no active part was played by the accused, he had at some earlier stage solicited or persuaded the minor to do so. In our opinion, if evidence to establish one of those things is lacking, it would not be legitimate to infer that the accused is guilty of taking the minor out of the keeping of the lawful guardian merely because after she has actually left her guardian's house or a house where her guardian had kept her, joined the accused and the accused helped her in her design not to return to her guardian's house by taking her along with him from place to place. No doubt, the part played by the accused could be regarded as facilitating the fulﬁlment of the intention of the girl. That part, in our   opinion, falls short of an inducement to the minor to slip out of the keeping of her lawful guardian and is, therefore, not tantamount to 'taking'.  The intention with which kidnapping is effected can be ascertained from the circumstances of the offence at the time of occurrence or prior or subsequent to it. A kidnapping does not per se lead to any inference of intent or purpose of kidnapping.1061. Persuasion by the accused which created willingness on the part of the minor to be taken out of the keeping of the lawful guardian was held by the Supreme Court to be enough to attract section 361. The Supreme Court also restated the ingredients.1062. Promise of marriage made to the minor girl for leaving the house of the lawful guardian was held to be an enticement.1063. The word 'take' means 'to cause to go' to escort or to get into possession. It implies want of wish and absence of desire of the person taken. There is a distinction between taking and allowing a minor to accompany a person.1064."

Exception 1.—A medical procedure or intervention shall not constitute rape. Exception 2.—Sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under ﬁfteen years of age, is not rape.]  COMMENTS.— The chapter sub-heading itself was changed from 'Of rape' to 'Sexual Offences' by Act 43 of 1983. The deﬁnition of rape has undergone a major change in admitting nonpenile penetration also but it continues to be gender-speciﬁc as committed against a female. Earlier, a public interest litigation in Sakshi v UOI,1174. seeking for a declaration to treat non-penile penetration also to be treated as rape failed when the Supreme Court declined the relief but the Court's exhortation to alter the deﬁnition paved way for the change of law.",

            "sub_section_description": "Based on the recommendations made by the Justice Verma Committee, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013, came into force with effect from 3 February 2013. The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 made amendments to the Cr PC, 1973, Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and the IPC, 1860. The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 expanded the deﬁnition of rape and substituted new sections for old sections such as sections 370, 375, 376, 376A, 376B, 376C and 376D. The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 also amended existing sections as well as created new offences in the IPC, 1860, such as: • Public servant disobeying direction under law (section 166A) • Punishment for non-treatment of victim (section 166B) • Voluntarily causing grievous hurt by use of acid, etc. (section 326A) • Voluntarily throwing or attempting to throw acid (section 326B) • Sexual harassment and punishment for sexual harassment (section 354A) • Assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe (section 354B) • Voyeurism (section 354C) • Stalking (section 354D) • Punishment for repeat offenders (section 376E)  The altered deﬁnition increasing the age of consent to 18 is also signiﬁcant for it makes any form of penetration as set out under the section with any girl less than 18 years of age to constitute rape. In a matrimonial setting, it would not have resulted in rape if the woman was still less than 18 and above 15 so long as there was consent by virtue of Exception 2 contained in the section. But the decision of the Supreme Court in   Independent Thought v UOI,1175. has held the provision to be unconstitutional in so far it relates to girl between ages 15 to 18. Now the Exception 2 has to be read as 'Sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under eighteen years of age is not rape'. Rape is violative of victim's fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution. It is the most morally and physically reprehensible crime in a society, as it is an assault on the body, mind and privacy of the victim. While a murderer destroys the physical frame of the victim, a rapist degrades and deﬁles the soul of a helpless female. Rape reduces a woman to an animal, as it shakes the very core of her life. By no means can a rape victim be called an accomplice. Rape leaves a permanent scar on the life of the victim, and therefore a rape victim is placed on a higher pedestal than an injured witness. Rape is a crime against the entire society and violates the human rights of the victim. Being the most hated crime, rape tantamounts to a serious blow to the supreme honour of a woman, and offends both, her esteem and dignity. It causes psychological and physical harm to the victim, leaving upon her indelible marks.1176."

            "sub_section_description": "Consent may be express or implied, coerced or misguided, obtained willingly or through deceit. Consent is an act of reason, accompanied by deliberation, the mind weighing, as in a balance, the good and evil on each side. There is a clear distinction between rape and consensual sex and the Court must very carefully examine whether the accused had actually wanted to marry the victim, or had mala ﬁde motive, and had made a false promise to this effect only to satisfy his lust, as the latter falls within the ambit of cheating or deception. There is a distinction between the mere breach of a promise, and not fulﬁlling a false promise. Thus, the Court must examine whether there was made, at an early stage a false promise of marriage by the accused; and whether the consent involved was given after wholly understanding the nature and consequences of sexual indulgence. There may be a case where the prosecutrix agrees to have sexual intercourse on account of her love and passion for the accused, and not solely on account of misrepresentation made to her by the accused, or where an accused on account of circumstances which he could not have foreseen, or which were beyond his control, was unable to marry her, despite having every intention to do so. Such cases must be treated differently. An accused can be convicted for rape only if the Court reaches a conclusion that the intention of the accused was mala ﬁde, and that he had clandestine motives.1179. Where a man and woman were living together, sometimes at her house and sometimes at the residence of the man and when the evidence suggested that it was not a case of a passive submission in the face of any psychological pressure exerted and there was a tacit consent not borne out of any misconception created in her mind, complaint under this section will be untenable.1180. In the event that the accused's promise is not false and has not been made with the   sole intention to seduce the prosecutrix to indulge in sexual acts, such an act(s) would not amount to rape. Thus, the same would only hold that the prosecutrix, under a misconception of fact to the extent that the accused is likely to marry her, submits to the lust of the accused, such a fraudulent act cannot be said to be consensual, so far as the offence of the accused is concerned.1181."

            "sub_section_description": "IPC, 1860 does not deﬁne consent in positive terms. But what cannot be regarded as consent is explained by section 90 which reads as 'consent given ﬁrst under fear of injury and second under a misconception of fact is not consent at all'. There are two grounds speciﬁed in section 90 which are analogous to coercion and mistake of fact. The factors set out in ﬁrst part of section 90 are from the point of view of the victim and second part of section 90 enacts the corresponding provision from the point of view of the accused. It envisages that the accused has knowledge or has reason to believe that the consent was given by the victim in consequence of fear of injury or misconception of fact. Thus, the second part lays emphasis on the knowledge or reasonable belief of the person who obtains the tainted consent. The requirements of both the parts should be cumulatively satisﬁed. In other words, the Court has to see whether the person giving the consent has given it under fear or misconception of fact and the Court should also be satisﬁed that the person doing the act, i.e., the alleged offender is conscious of the fact or should have reason to think that but for the fear or misconception, the consent would not have been given. This is the scheme of section 90 which is couched in negative terminology. As observed in Deelip Singh @ Dilip Kumar v State of Bihar,1182. section 90 cannot be considered as an exhaustive deﬁnition of consent for the purposes of IPC, 1860. The normal connotation and concept of consent is not intended to be excluded.1183. Submission of the body under the fear or terror cannot be construed as a consented sexual act. Consent for the purpose of section 375 requires voluntary participation not only after the exercise of intelligence based on the knowledge of the signiﬁcance and moral quality of the act but after having fully exercised the choice between resistance and assent. Whether there was consent or not, is to be ascertained only on a careful study of all relevant circumstances.1184. The consent does not merely mean hesitation or reluctance or a 'No' to any sexual advances but has to be an aﬃrmative one in clear terms. Consent has to be categorical, unequivocal, voluntary and could be given by words, gestures or any form of verbal or non-verbal communication signifying willingness to participate in speciﬁc sexual act. Woman who does not physically resist act of rape shall not by that reason only be regarded as having consented to such sexual activity. In normal parlance, consent would mean voluntary agreement of complainant to engage in sexual activity without being abused or exploited by coercion or threats. Normal rule is that consent has to be given and it cannot be assumed.1185."

            "sub_section_description": "In Dileep Singh v State of Bihar,1186. the Supreme Court observed that: though will and consent often interlace and an act done against the will of the person can be said to be an act done without consent, the Indian Penal Code categorizes these two expressions under separate heads in order to be as comprehensive as possible.  In the facts of the case what is crucial to be considered is whether ﬁrst clause or second clause of section 375 IPC, 1860 is attracted. The expressions 'against her will' and 'without her consent' may overlap sometimes but surely the two expressions in ﬁrst and second clause have different connotation and dimension. The expression 'against her will' would ordinarily mean that the intercourse was done by a man with a woman despite her resistance and opposition. On the other hand, the expression 'without her consent' would comprehend an act of reason accompanied by deliberation.1187. Supreme Court Guidelines to Prevent Child Sexual Abuse (1) The persons in charge of the schools/educational institutions, special homes, children homes, shelter homes, hostels, remand homes, jails, etc., or wherever children are housed, if they come across instances of sexual abuse or assault on a minor child which they believe to have committed or come to know that they are being sexually molested or assaulted are directed to report those facts keeping upmost secrecy to the nearest SJPU or local police, and they, depending upon the gravity of the complaint and its genuineness, take appropriate follow up action casting no stigma to the child or to the family members. (2) Media personals, persons in charge of Hotel, lodge, hospital, clubs, studios, photograph facilities have to duly comply with the provision of section 20 of the Act 32 of 2012 and provide information to the SJPU, or local police. Media has to strictly comply with section 23 of the Act as well. (3) Children with intellectual disability are more vulnerable to physical, sexual and emotional abuse. Institutions which house them or persons in care and protection, come across any act of sexual abuse, have a duty to bring to the notice of the Juvenile Justice Board/SJPU or local police and they in turn be in touch with the competent authority and take appropriate action. (4) Further, it is made clear that if the perpetrator of the crime is a family member himself, then utmost care be taken and further action be taken in consultation with the mother or other female members of the family of the child, bearing in mind the fact that best interest of the child is of paramount consideration. (5) Hospitals, whether Government or privately-owned or medical institutions where children are being treated come to know that children admitted are subjected to sexual abuse, the same will immediately be reported to the nearest JJ Board/SJPU and the JJ Board, in consultation with SJPU, should take appropriate steps in accordance with the law safeguarding the interest of child. (6) The non-reporting of the crime by anybody, after having come to know that a minor child below the age of 18 years was subjected to any sexual assault, is a serious crime and by not reporting they are screening offenders from legal punishment and hence be held liable under the ordinary criminal law and prompt action be taken against them, in accordance with law.   (7) Complaints, if any, received by NCPCR, SCPCR, Child Welfare Committee (CWC) and Child Helpline, NGO's or Women's Organizations, etc., they may take further follow up action in consultation with the nearest JJ Board, SJPU or local police in accordance with law. (8) The Central Government and the State Governments are directed to constitute SJPUs in all the Districts, if not already constituted and they have to take prompt and effective action in consultation with JJ Board to take care of child and protect the child and also take appropriate steps against the perpetrator of the crime. (9) The Central Government and every State Government should take all measures as provided under section 43 of the The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (Act 32/2012) to give wide publicity of the provisions of the Act through media including television, radio and print media, at regular intervals, to make the general public, children as well as their parents and guardians, aware of the provisions of the Act.

        "section_comments": "Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1983 (Mathura Act).—Acquittal of policemen in the infamous Mathura Rape Case1208. and the nationwide protest against the verdict led to the 1983 Amendments to the Rape Laws in India. Sections 375 and 376, IPC, 1860 had been substantially changed by the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1983 (Act 43 of 1983). The same Act also introduced several new sections, viz., sections 376A, 376B, 376C and 376D, IPC, 1860. Of these, section 376A punished sexual intercourse with wife without her consent by a judicially separated husband, section 376B punished sexual intercourse by a public servant with woman in his custody, section 376C punished sexual intercourse by Superintendent of Jail, Remand Home, etc., with inmates in such institutions and section 376D punished sexual intercourse by any member of the management or staff of a hospital with any woman in that hospital. These new sections were introduced with a view to stop sexual abuses of women in   custody, care and control by various categories of persons which though not amounting to rape were nevertheless considered highly reprehensible. The amended section 376 IPC, 1860 prescribed a minimum punishment of seven years' imprisonment for the offence of rape. For combating the vice of custodial rape, rape on pregnant woman, rape on girls under 12 years of age and gang rape a minimum punishment of 10 years' imprisonment had been made obligatory. However, for special reasons to be recorded in the judgment the Court in either case could impose a sentence lesser than seven or 10 years, as the case may be. A further improvement in the law relating to sexual offences could be found in the provisions of section 228A IPC, 1860, section 327(2) Cr PC, 1973 and section 114A Indian Evidence Act, 1872 which were introduced by the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1983. New provisions for trial in camera (section 327(2) Cr PC, 1973) and against disclosure as to identity of the victims of sexual offences as in sections 376, 376A, 376B, 376C and 376D, IPC, 1860 (section 228, IPC, 1860) were not only to protect the honour of sexually-victimised women but also made it possible for them to depose in Court without any fear of social ostracism. And section 114A Indian Evidence Act, 1872 by raising a presumption as to absence of consent in cases of custodial rape, rape on pregnant women and gang rape as in clauses (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (g) of sub-section (2) of section 376, IPC, 1860 merely on the evidence of the ravished women had, at least partially, removed the inﬁrmity from the evidence of a victim of rape that was hitherto unjustly attached to her testimony without taking note of the fact that in India, a disclosure of this nature was likely to ruin the prospect of the girl's rehabilitation in society for all times to come and unless her story was painfully true she would not have taken such a grave risk merely to malign the accused.1209. Moreover, in cases of rape, particularly custodial rape it was almost impossible to get any other independent evidence to corroborate the testimony of the prosecutrix. It has been held that the result of the Amendment of 1983 is that the offences listed in section 376(2) are graver in nature and therefore, it is necessary that the charge under the sub-section should be distinctly recorded and also reasons for conviction should be recorded.1210.",

Some recommendations, viz., not to increase the age of consent to 18 from 16, as it stood before; introduction of matrimonial rape; non-requirement of sanction for prosecution of armed personnel were not accepted but the law changed as regards against consent by introducing section 114A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 barring questions in cross-examination of the victim about the previous sexual experience or immoral character and also making the issue of previous sexual experience as irrelevant, and certain other procedural aspects in Cr PC, 1973 inter alia, relating to investigation by woman police oﬃcers, video recording of statements before magistrates, time limit for completing of enquiry, requirement of trial proceedings in camera, etc. [s 376.1.1] No death for rape.— Respecting the demand from many quarters, the Verma committee reacted as: In our considered view, taking into account the views expressed on the subject by an overwhelming majority of scholars, leaders of women's organisations, and other stakeholders, there is a strong submission that the seeking of death penalty would be a regressive step in the ﬁeld of sentencing and reformation. We, having bestowed considerable thought on the subject, and having provided for enhanced sentences (short of death) in respect of the above-noted aggravated forms of sexual assault, in the larger   interests of society, and having regard to the current thinking in favour of abolition of the death penalty, and also to avoid the argument of any sentencing arbitrariness, we are not inclined to recommend the death penalty.  [s 376.1.2] Chemical Castration.— Rejecting the proposal of Chemical Castration as a punishment for rape Committee observed: We note that it would be unconstitutional and inconsistent with basic human rights treaties for the state to expose any citizen without their consent to potentially dangerous medical side-effects. For this reason, we do not recommend mandatory chemical castration of any type as a punishment for sex offenders."

Rape on a woman under 12 years of age is now made punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than 20 years, but which may extend to imprisonment for life, and with ﬁne or with death. Gang rape on a woman under 12 years of age is now made punishable with imprisonment for life, and with ﬁne, or with death. Rape of girls below the age of 16 years is punishable with imprisonment of 20 years or life imprisonment. The imprisonment for life shall mean imprisonment for the remainder of that person's natural life. The minimum punishment for rape of girl above the age of 16 is 10 years. Section 376 is not gender neutral and sexual abuse of minor boys does not come within its purview. The punishment under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 continues to be 10 years to life imprisonment for offences against boys below 12 and seven years to life imprisonment for offences against boys above 12 to 18. The law amends the Cr PC, 1973 mandating the completing of investigation from the existing provision of three months to two months. The Act also bars anticipatory bail in cases of rape of minor girls below 16 years of age. Any appeal against sentence of rape shall be disposed of within six months."

Such an opportunity should not, therefore, be lost on any account. Though the prosecutrix can be examined only with her consent, the accused can be subjected to such an examination by virtue of section 53 of the Cr PC, 1973. It has also to be remembered that the accused too can demand such an examination under section 54 Cr PC, 1860 especially when he feels that such an examination will disprove the charge brought against him. Thus, presence of smegma on corona glandis (glans penis) of the accused soon after the incident is proof against complete penetration since it is rubbed off during intercourse.1211. But to be of any value examination of smegma must be done within 24 hours.1212. Where proof of sexual intercourse with the woman is itself not an issue, such as when it is an admitted fact and the case rests upon issues of consent and where medical examination revealed semen stains on the vaginal swabs and salwar of the victim, the Court said that at best it is an evidence of commission of sexual intercourse but not necessarily of rape.1213."

They are also entitled to medical procedures conducted in a manner that respects their right to consent. Medical procedures should not be carried out in a manner that constitutes cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment and health should be of paramount consideration while dealing with gender-based violence.

There is no rule of law that her testimony cannot be acted upon without corroboration in material particulars, for the reason, that she stands on a much higher pedestal than an injured witness.1215. A woman, who is the victim of sexual assault, is not an accomplice to the crime but is a victim of another person's lust and, therefore, her evidence need not be tested with the same amount of suspicion as that of an accomplice. The Indian Evidence Act, 1872 nowhere says that her evidence cannot be accepted unless it is corroborated in material particulars. She is undoubtedly a competent witness under section 118 and her evidence must receive the same weight as is attached to an injured in cases of physical violence.1216."

            "sub_section_description": "Whether the victim of rape was previously accustomed to sexual intercourse or not, cannot be the determinative question. On the contrary, the question still remains as to whether the accused committed rape on the victim on the occasion complained of. Even if the victim had lost her virginity earlier, it can certainly not give a licence to any person to rape her. It is the accused who was on trial and not the victim. So as to whether the victim is of a promiscuous character is totally irrelevant in a case of rape. Even a woman of easy virtue has a right to refuse to submit herself to sexual intercourse to anyone and everyone, because she is not a vulnerable object or prey for being sexually assaulted by anyone and everyone. A prosecutrix stands on a higher pedestal than an injured witness for the reason that an injured witness gets the injury on the physical form, while the prosecutrix suffers psychologically and emotionally.1217. In Narender Kumar v State (NCT of Delhi),1218. the Supreme Court dealt with a case where the allegation was that the victim of rape herself was an unchaste woman, and a woman of easy virtue. The Court discussed Rajoo v State of MP,1219. and held that so far as the prosecutrix is concerned, mere statement of prosecutrix herself is enough to record a conviction, when her evidence is read in its totality and found to be worthy of reliance. The incident in itself causes a great distress and humiliation to the victim though, undoubtedly a false allegation of rape can cause equal distress, humiliation and damage to the accused as well. The Court further held that some facts exist proving that victim was habituated to sexual intercourse, cannot be a reason to draw an inference that she was of 'loose moral character'. This cannot be a reason for her to be raped; she also has a right to protect her dignity and refuse to submit to sexual intercourse by anyone. Merely because a woman is of easy virtue, her evidence cannot be discarded on that ground alone rather it is to be cautiously appreciated.1220."

            "sub_section_description": "The trend of judicial opinion is that in rape cases corroboration is not a matter of law, but a guide of prudence, as the testimony of the victim is vital unless there are compelling reasons for corroboration.1225. The Supreme Court has held that a woman who has been raped is not an accomplice. If she was ravished she is the victim of an outrage and if she consented there is no rape. In the case of a girl below the age of consent, her consent will not matter so far as the offence of rape is concerned, but if she consented her evidence will be suspect as that of an accomplice. The true rule of   prudence requires that in every case of this type the advisability of corroboration should be present in the mind of the Judge and that must be indicated in the judgment. But corroboration can be dispensed with by the Judge if in the particular circumstances of the case before him he himself is satisﬁed that it is safe to do so.1226. Indeed no rule of thumb can be laid down in this matter for every case must depend a good deal on its own peculiar facts and circumstances. Thus, in Raﬁq's case1227. Krishna Iyer, J, observed: when no woman of honour will accuse another of rape since she sacriﬁces thereby what is dearest to her, he cannot cling to a fossil formula and insist on corroborative evidence, even if taken as a whole, the case spoken to by the victim strikes a judicial mind as probable … When a woman is ravished what is inﬂicted is not merely physical injury but the deep sense of some deathless shame … Judicial response to human rights cannot be blunted by legal bigotry.  Similarly, in Bhoginbhai's case1228. Thakkar, J, observed with some anguish: In the Indian setting refusal to act on the testimony of the victim of sexual assault in the absence of corroboration as a rule is adding insult to injury … A girl or a woman in the tradition bound non-permissive society of India would be extremely reluctant even to admit that any incident which is likely to reﬂect on her chastity had ever occurred. She would be conscious of the danger of being ostracised by the society … And when in the face of these factors the crime is brought to light, there is built-in assurance that the charge is genuine rather than fabricated … Just as a witness who has sustained an injury (which is not shown or believed to be self-inﬂicted) is the best witness in the sense that he is least likely to exculpate the real offender, the evidence of a victim of sex offence is entitled to great weight absence of corroboration notwithstanding.  Refusal by the accused person to subject himself to blood test for the purpose of determining his fatherhood of the child who was born as a result of the alleged rape was considered to be an evidence of corroboration.1229."

She went in the jeep of the accused at night for a long distance intending to meet her senior oﬃcer. She alleged that she was raped by the accused in his house when they halted there. This was wholly unusual conduct. There was no explanation of any compelling reason for meeting the oﬃcer at night. There were no stains of semen or blood on her clothes. She asserted virginity but medical evidence showed that she was habituated to sex. The accused was held to be entitled to beneﬁt of doubt.1236. Two persons were charged and prosecuted under section 376(2)(g) for gang raping a girl. The victim was desirous of marrying one of them and, therefore, did not report the matter willingly. There were various inﬁrmities in the prosecution evidence. The conviction of the accused for the aforesaid offence was set aside.1237."

A defenceless married woman was tricked out of her house taking advantage of the drunken state of her husband. She was ravished in a most dastardly manner by three out of six members of the gang.

Assistance to Rape Victims : Supreme Court Guidelines In Delhi Domestic Working Women's Forum v UOI,1251. the Supreme Court found that in the cases of rape, the investigating agency as well as the Subordinate Courts sometimes adopt totally an indifferent attitude towards the prosecutrix and therefore, the Supreme Court issued following directions in order to render assistance to the victims of rape: (1) The complainants of sexual assault cases should be provided with legal representation. It is important to have someone who is well-acquainted with the criminal justice system. The role of the victim's advocate would not only be to explain to the victim the nature of the proceedings, to prepare her for the case and to assist her in the police station and in Court but to provide her with guidance as to how she might obtain help of a different nature from other agencies, for example, mind counselling or medical assistance. It is important to secure continuity of assistance by ensuring that the same person who looked after the complainant's interests in the police station represents her till the end of the case. (2) Legal assistance will have to be provided at the police station since the victim of sexual assault might very well be in a distressed state upon arrival at the police station, the guidance and support of a lawyer at this stage and whilst she was being questioned would be of great assistance to her. (3) The police should be under a duty to inform the victim of her right to representation before any questions were asked of her and that the police report should state that the victim was so informed. (4) A list of advocates willing to act in these cases should be kept at the police station for victims who did not have a particular lawyer in mind or whose own lawyer was unavailable. (5) The advocate shall be appointed by the Court, upon application by the police at the earliest convenient moment, but in order to ensure that victims were questioned without undue delay, advocates would be authorised to act at the police station before leave of the Court was sought or obtained. (6) In all rape trials anonymity of the victim must be maintained, as far as necessary. (7) It is necessary, having regard to the Directive Principles contained under Article 38(1) of the Constitution of India to set up Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. Rape victims frequently incur substantial ﬁnancial loss. Some, for example, are too traumatised to continue in employment. (8) Compensation for victims shall be awarded by the Court on conviction of the offender and by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board whether or not a conviction has taken place. The Board will take into account pain, suffering and shock as well as loss of earnings due to pregnancy and the expenses of child birth if this occurred as a result of the rape.  In addition thereto, it is an obligation on the part of the State authorities and particularly, the Director General of Police and Home Ministry of the State to issue proper guidelines and instructions to the other authorities as how to deal with such cases and what kind of treatment is to be given to the prosecutrix, as a victim of sexual assault requires a totally different kind of treatment not only from the society but also   from the State authorities. Certain care has to be taken by the Doctor who medically examines the victim of rape. The victim of rape should generally be examined by a female doctor. Simultaneously, she should be provided the help of some psychiatric. The medical report should be prepared expeditiously and the Doctor should examine the victim of rape thoroughly and give his/her opinion with all possible angle, e.g., opinion regarding the age taking into consideration the number of teeth, secondary sex characters, and radiological test, etc. The Investigating Oﬃcer must ensure that the victim of rape should be handled carefully by lady police oﬃcial/oﬃcer, depending upon the availability of such oﬃcial/oﬃcer. The victim should be sent for medical examination at the earliest and her statement should be recorded by the IO in the presence of her family members making the victim comfortable except in incest cases. Investigation should be completed at the earliest to avoid the bail to the accused on technicalities as provided under section 167 Cr PC, 1973 and ﬁnal report should be submitted under section 173 Cr PC, 1973 at the earliest.

But in Suresh Kumar Koushal v NAZ Foundation,1267. the Supreme Court overruled the Delhi High Court judgment holding that those who indulge in carnal intercourse in the ordinary course and those who indulge in carnal intercourse against the order of nature constitute different classes and the people falling in the latter category cannot claim that section 377 suffers from the vice of arbitrariness and irrational classiﬁcation. What section 377 does is merely to deﬁne the particular offence and prescribe punishment for the same which can be awarded if in the trial conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Cr PC, 1973 and other statutes of the same family the person is found guilty. Therefore, section 377 IPC, 1860 was held to be not ultra vires Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution. It was also observed by the Supreme Court that the Court merely pronounced on the correctness of the view taken by the Delhi High Court on the constitutionality of section 377 IPC, 1860 and found that the said section did not suffer from any constitutional inﬁrmity. Notwithstanding this verdict, the competent legislature shall be free to consider the desirability and propriety of deleting section 377 IPC, 1860 from the statute book or amend the same. A constitution bench of the Supreme Court in Navtej Singh Johar v UOI,1268. overruled Suresh Kumar Koushal and held that consensual carnal intercourse among adults in private space, does not in any way harm public decency or morality. Therefore, section   377 in its present form violates Article 19(1)(a). The court held that so far as section 377 penalises any consensual sexual relationship between two adults, be it homosexuals (man and man), heterosexuals (man and woman) or lesbians (woman and woman), cannot be regarded as constitutional. However, if anyone engages in any kind of sexual activity with animal, said aspect of section 377 is constitutional and it shall remain a penal offence. The court held that any act of description covered under section 377 done between two individuals without consent of any one of them would invite penal liability. Further, non-consensual acts which have been criminalised by virtue of section 377 have already been designated as penal offences under section 375 and under POCSO Act, 2012."

Section 375, as substituted by the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013, does not use words 'subject to any other provision of IPC' which indicates that section 375 is not subject to section 377.

Explanation 1.—A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable property, is not the subject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is severed from the earth. Explanation 2.—A moving effected by the same act which affects the severance may be a theft. Explanation 3.—A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle which prevented it from moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it. Explanation 4.—A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that animal, and to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal. Explanation 5.—The consent mentioned in the deﬁnition may be express or implied, and may be given either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either express or implied. ILLUSTRATIONS (a) A cuts down a tree on Z's ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the  tree out of Z's possession without Z's consent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft. (b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z's dog to follow it. Here, if  A's intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z's possession without Z's consent. A has committed theft as soon as Z's dog has begun to follow A. (c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain  direction, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure. (d) A, being Z's servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z's plate, dishonestly  runs away with the plate, without Z's consent. A has committed theft. (e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of the warehouse, till Z  shall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z's possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z's possession, and   A has not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust. (f) A ﬁnds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the  ring is in Z's possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft. (g) A ﬁnds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A by  taking it, commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property. (h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house. Not venturing to  misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of ﬁrst moving the ring, commits theft. (i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A,  not owing to the jeweller any debt for which the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z's hand, and carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as what he did was not done dishonestly. (j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully  as a security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z's possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. (k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z's possession without  Z's consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. (l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z's possession, without Z's consent, with  the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefore committed theft. (m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence, and takes  away a book without Z's express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z's implied consent to use Z's book. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft. (n) A asks charity from Z's wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A  knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z's wife is authorised to give away alms. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft. (o) A is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives A valuable property, which A knows to  belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has no authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft. (p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A's own property, takes   that property out of B's possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft.  COMMENT— Section 378 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860) deﬁnes 'theft' as the dishonest removal of movable property 'out of the possession of any person' without the consent of that person. 'Theft', has the following ingredients, namely, (i) dishonest intention to take property; (ii) the property must be movable; (ii) it should be taken out of the possession of another person; (iv) it should be taken without the consent of that person; and (v) there must be some moving of the property in order to accomplish the taking of it.

COMMENT— In order to constitute theft ﬁve factors are essential:— (1) Dishonest intention to take property; (2) The property must be movable; (3) The property should be taken out of the possession of another person; (4) The property should be taken without the consent of that person; and (5) There must be some moving of the property in order to accomplish the taking of  it.",

'Intending to take dishonestly'.—Intention is the gist of the offence. The intention to take dishonestly exists when the taker intends to cause wrongful gain to one person or wrongful loss to another person. Where, therefore, the accused acting bona ﬁde in the interests of his employers ﬁnding a party of ﬁshermen poaching on his master's ﬁsheries, took charge of the nets and retained possession of them, pending the orders of his employers, it was held that he was not guilty of theft.3 When a person seizes cattle on the ground that they were trespassing on his land and causing damage to his crop or produce and gives out that he is taking them to the cattle pound, he commits no offence of theft, and however mistaken he may be about his right to that land or crop. He has no dishonest intention.4 Where a respectable person just pinches the cycle of another person, as his own cycle at the time was missing, and brings it back and the important element of criminal intention is completely absent and he did not intend by his act to cause wrongful gain to himself, it does not amount to theft.5 The intention to take dishonestly must exist at the time of the moving of the property [vide ill. (h)]. The taking must be dishonest. It is not necessary that the taking must cause wrongful gain to the talker; it will suﬃce if it causes wrongful loss to the owner.6. Thus, where the accused took the complainant's three cows against her will and distributed them among her creditors, he was found guilty of stealing.7. It makes no difference in the accused's guilt that the act was not intended to procure any personal beneﬁt to him. Could it be said that a servant would not be guilty of theft if he were to deliver over his master's plate to a pressing tailor, and tell him to pay himself? If the act done was not done animo furtandi, it will not amount to theft. It is no more stealing than it will be to take a stick out of a man's hand to beat him with it.8.",

There may be theft without an intention to deprive the owner of the property permanently. Where the accused took out an Indian Air Force plane for an unauthorised ﬂight, even temporarily, it was held that he was guilty of theft.10. It would satisfy the deﬁnition of theft if the accused takes away any movable property out of the possession of another person though he intended to return it later on. The accused, who was working in a Government oﬃce, removed a ﬁle to his house, made it available to an outsider and then returned it to the oﬃce after two days. It was held by the Supreme Court that the accused was guilty of theft.11."

            "sub_section_description": "Where property is removed in the assertion of a contested claim of right, however illfounded that claim may be, the removal thereof does not constitute theft.12. Where the question in dispute between two parties was whether the sale of a mahal (village) carried within its ambit the sale of certain trees and the servant of one of the parties cut and removed the trees under his master's orders under the bona ﬁde belief that they belonged to his master, it was held that the servant was not guilty of theft.13. The dispute as to ownership must be bona ﬁde. A mere colourable pretence to obtain or keep possession of property does not avail as a defence.14. It is not theft if a person, acting under a mistaken notion of law, and believing that certain property is his, and that he has the right to take the same, until payment of the balance of some money due to him from the vendor, removes such property from the possession of the vendee.15. Where a bona ﬁde claim of right exists, it can be a good defence to a prosecution for theft. Thus where the question of possession was in a ﬂuid state and the accused bona ﬁde believed that the crop was his as he had cultivated the land, no offence either of criminal trespass or theft could be made out against him. Such a matter is better decided in a Civil Court.16. However, it was held in a case of dacoity that the question of bona ﬁde claim of right arises only where the accused show to the Court's satisfaction that their belief is reasonable and is based on some documents and title, however weak it may be.17. An act does not amount to theft under such circumstances unless there be not only no legal right but no appearance or colour of a legal right.18."

Because of the fact that status of complainant relating to the vehicle in question having purchased under Hire Purchase Agreement till saturation of the loan amount remains merely a trustee or bailee on behalf of ﬁnancer and further in the aforesaid background the ﬁnancer happens to be the real owner of the vehicle till saturation of the loan amount, no prosecution would lie on that score.22.

            "sub_section_description": "Cart-loads of earth26. or stones27. quarried and carried away from the land of another are subject of theft.  [s 379.6.1] Timber.— Extraction of teak timber without licence amounts to theft of Government timber.28. In Bhaiyalal v State of MP,29. it was held that the act of cutting of trees standing on Government land amounts to theft under section 378.  [s 379.6.2] Salt.— Salt spontaneously formed on the surface of a swamp appropriated by Government,30. or in a creek under the supervision of Government,31. is subject of theft; but not that which is formed on a swamp not guarded by Government.32.  [s 379.6.3] Human body.— Human body whether living or dead (except bodies, or portions thereof, or mummies, preserved in museums or scientiﬁc institutions) is not movable property.33.   [s 379.6.4] Idol.— Idol is movable property and can be the subject matter of theft. It's being a juridical person for certain purposes is no bar to its also being a movable property.34.  [s 379.6.5] Gas.— A, having contracted with a gas company to consume gas and pay according to meter, in order to avoid paying for the full quantity of gas consumed, introduced into the entrance pipe another pipe for the purpose of conveying the gas to the exit pipe of the meter and so to the burners, for consumption without passing through the meter itself. The entrance pipe was the property of A, but he had not by his contract any interest in the gas until it passed through the meter. It was held that A was guilty of larceny.35.  [s 379.6.6] Electricity.— Theft of electricity is governed by section 135 of the Electricity Act, 2003. Though the electricity is not movable property within the meaning of section 378, IPC, 1860, and as such its dishonest abstraction cannot be regarded as theft under section 378, yet by a legal ﬁction created by section 39 of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 (now repealed), such an act should be deemed to be an offence of theft and punished under section 379, IPC, 1860, and section 39 of the Electricity Act, 1910. In the case of Mahalakshmi Spinners Ltd v State of Haryana,36. it was held that when there is a speciﬁc/ special law covering the question of theft of electricity, i.e. section 135 of the Electricity Act, (Act 9 of 1910), the general law contained in section 379, IPC, 1860 will not be applicable. Any attempt by the notice to add offence under section 379 IPC, 1860 will be a crude devise by the prosecution to overcome the likely objection from the accused about the ﬁling of the complaint instead of registration of FIR. Law is well settled that special law will prevail over the general law.  [s 379.6.7] Water.— Water supplied by a water company to a consumer, and standing in his pipes, may be the subject of larceny.37. Water when conveyed in pipes and so reduced into possession can be the subject of theft;38. but not water running freely from a river through an open channel made and maintained by a person.39.  [s 379.6.8] Animals.—Bull.— A bull dedicated to an idol and allowed to roam at large is not res nullius (thing belonging to no one) but remains the property of the trustees of the temple, and can become the subject of theft;40. but not a bull set at large in accordance with a religious usage.41.  [s 379.6.9] Peacock.—   A peacock tamed but not kept in conﬁnement is the subject of theft.42. So is the case with pigeons kept in a dovecote and partridges.  [s 379.6.10] Fish.— Fish in an ordinary open irrigation tank,43. or in a tank not enclosed on all sides but dependent on the overﬂow of a neighbouring channel,44. are ferae naturae and not subject to theft. If the water in an irrigation tank has gone so low as not to permit the ﬁsh leaving the tank then they may be subject of theft.45. Similarly, ﬁsh in an enclosed tank are restrained of their natural liberty and liable to be taken at any time according to the pleasure of the owner, and are, therefore, subject of theft.46. Thus ﬁsh in an enclosed Government tank is the property in possession of Government and it is theft to catch ﬁsh therein without a licence apart from being an offence under the Fisheries Act, 1897.47. Fish are said to be in the possession of a person who has possession of any expanse of water such as a tank where they live but from where they cannot escape. They are also regarded as being in the possession of a person who owns an exclusive right to catch them in a particular spot known as a ﬁshery but only within that spot.48. Where plots belonging to different owners in a low-lying area, demarcated by ridges of small height, are sub-merged during certain months in the year by one sheet of water and ﬁsh escape from one plot to another, it cannot be said in such a case that ﬁsh is the subject matter of theft.49.  [s 379.6.11] Crop.— Removal of paddy crop has been held to be theft. Persons who helped removal under directions as labourers were not guilty. The fact that the land was in the possession of the complainant and it was he who had grown the crop was held to be suﬃcient to negative the accused's suggestion that he removed the crop under a bona ﬁde belief that he was entitled to it.50.  [s 379.6.12] Standing Timber.— Standing timber being embedded in the earth is immovable property but the moment it is severed from the earth it becomes capable of being the object of theft.51.  [s 379.6.13] Ballot Paper.— Accused was allegedly found in possession of a bundle of 84 stolen postal ballot papers at gate of printing press. High Court rejected the plea of petitioner that since he was found in possession of ballot papers, he ought not to have been tried for an offence under section 380 IPC, 1860,rather he could have been tried under section 127(p)(iv) of Assam Panchayat Act, 1994.52.  [s 379.6.14] Motor vehicles.—   The allegation was that the accused changed engine, colour, etc. of stolen vehicles and got them registered in new owners' names. But no particular instance was shown. The incident was more than ten years old. There was no explanation for delay in presenting charge-sheet. Hence, acquittal was held proper.53."

Where a person takes a lorry on hire-purchase system from a company which under the agreement had reserved the right of seizing the lorry in the event of default in payment of instalments, and default is made, then the company is not entitled to retake possession of the lorry by force or by removing it from the hands of the purchaser's servants who had no authority, express or implied, to give any consent. If the company or its agents do so they are guilty of an offence under this section. The question whether ownership had or had not passed to the purchaser is wholly immaterial as this section deals with possession and not ownership. The legal possession of the lorry was vested in the purchaser and the company was not entitled to recover possession of the lorry, even though default in payment of any instalments had taken place, without the consent of the purchaser. Possession of the driver and the cleaner was the possession of their master and they were not competent to give consent on behalf of the master.69."

The plea of Double Jeopardy was rejected holding that both offences are not same in terms of Article 20(2) of the Constitution. A cursory comparison of these two provisions with section 378 of IPC, 1860 would go to show that the ingredients are totally different. The contravention of the terms and conditions of mining lease, etc. constitutes an offence punishable under section 21 of the Mines and Minerals Act, 1957, whereas dishonestly taking any movable property out of the possession of a person without his consent constitutes theft. Thus, it is undoubtedly clear that the ingredients of an offence of theft as deﬁned in s 378 of IPC, 1860 are totally different from the ingredients of an offence punishable under section 21(1) r/w.s. 4 (1) and 4 (1 A) of the Mines and Minerals Act, 1957.90."

(c) A meets Z and Z's child on the highroad. A takes the child and threatens to ﬂing  it down a precipice, unless Z delivers his purse. Z, in consequence delivers his purse. Here A has extorted the purse from Z, by causing Z to be in fear of instant hurt to the child who is there present. A has therefore committed robbery on Z. (d) A obtains property from Z by saying—\"Your child is in the hands of my gang, and  will be put to death unless you send us ten thousand rupees\". This is extortion,   and punishable as such; but it is not robbery, unless Z is put in fear of the instant death of his child.

A large proportion of robberies will be half theft, half extortion. A seizes Z, threatens to murder him, unless he delivers all his property, and begins to pull off Z's ornaments. Z in terror begs that A will take all he has, and spare his life, assists in taking off his ornaments, and delivers them to A. Here, such ornaments as A took without Z's consent are taken by theft. Those which Z delivered up from fear of death are acquired by extortion. It is by no means improbable that Z's right-arm bracelet may have been obtained by theft, and left-arm bracelet by extortion; that the rupees in Z's girdle may have been obtained by theft, and those in his turban by extortion. Probably in nine-tenths of the robberies which are committed, something like this actually takes place, and it is probable that a few minutes later neither the robber nor the person robbed would be able to recollect in what proportions theft and extortion were mixed in the crime; nor is it at all necessary for the ends of justice that this should be ascertained. For though, in general the consent of a sufferer is a circumstance which vary materially modiﬁes the character of the offence, and which ought, therefore, to be made known to the Courts, yet the consent which a person gives to the taking of his property by a ruﬃan who holds a pistol to his breast is a circumstance altogether immaterial\".140. The Explanation and illustrations (b) and (c) mark the distinction between simple extortion and extortion which is robbery. Illustration (a) indicates when theft is robbery. An analysis of section 390 IPC, 1860 would show that in order that theft may constitute robbery, prosecution has to establish: (a) if in order to the committing of theft; or (b) in committing the theft; or (c) in carrying away or attempting to carry away property obtained by theft; or (d) the offender for that end i.e. any of the ends contemplated by (a) to (c); or (e) voluntarily causes or attempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful  restraint or fear of instant death or of instant hurt or instant wrongful restraint. In other words, theft would only be robbery if for any of the ends mentioned in (a) to (c) the offender voluntarily causes or attempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint or fear of instant death or of instant hurl or instant wrongful restraint. If the ends does not fall within (a) to (c) but, the offender still causes or attempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint or fear of instant death or of instant hurt or instant wrongful restraint, the offence would not be robbery. The Court emphasised that (a) or (b) or (c) have to be read conjunctively with (d) and (e). It is only   when (a) or (b) or (c) co-exist with (d) and (e) or there is a nexus between any of them and (d) and (e) would theft amount to robbery.141."

COMMENT— Dacoity is robbery committed by ﬁve or more persons, otherwise there is no difference between dacoity and robbery. The gravity of the offence consists in the terror it causes by the presence of a number of offenders. Abettors who are present and aiding when the crime is committed are counted in the number. Section 391 IPC, 1860 explains the offence of 'dacoity'. When ﬁve or more persons conjointly commit or attempt to commit a robbery, or where the whole number of persons conjointly committing or attempting to commit a robbery, and persons present and aiding such commission and attempt amount to ﬁve or more, every person so committing, attempting or aiding, is said to commit 'dacoity'. Under section 392 IPC, 1860, the offence of 'robbery' simpliciter is punishable with rigorous imprisonment which may extend to ten years or 14 years depending upon the facts of a given case. Section 396 IPC, 1860 brings within its ambit a murder committed along with 'dacoity'. In terms of this provision, if any one of the ﬁve or more persons, who are conjointly committing dacoity, commits murder in so committing dacoity, every one of those persons shall be punished with death or imprisonment for life or rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years and shall also be liable to ﬁne. On a plain reading of these provisions, it is clear that to constitute an offence of 'dacoity', robbery essentially should be committed by ﬁve or more persons. Similarly, to constitute an offence of 'dacoity with murder' any one of the ﬁve or more persons should commit a murder while committing the dacoity, then every one of such persons so committing, attempting to commit or aiding, by ﬁction of law, would be deemed to have committed the offence of murder and be liable for punishment provided under these provisions depending upon the facts and circumstances of the case.153. Dacoity is perhaps the only offence which the Legislature has made punishable at four stages. When ﬁve or more persons assemble for the purpose of committing a dacoity, each of them is punishable under section 402 merely on the ground of joining the assembly. Another stage is that of preparation and if any one makes preparation to commit a dacoity, he is punishable under section 399. The deﬁnition of 'dacoity' in this section shows that the other two stages, namely, the stage of attempting to commit and the stage of actual commission of robbery, have been treated alike, and come within the deﬁnition.154. In other words, attempt to commit dacoity is also dacoity.   \"It will, therefore, be seen that it is possible to commit the offence of dacoity under section 395, IPC, 1860, by merely attempting to commit a robbery by ﬁve or more persons without being successful in getting any booty whatsoever. Thus, if in a particular case the dacoits are forced to retreat due to stiff opposition from the inmates or villagers without collecting any booty, then it must be held that the offence of dacoity is completed the moment the dacoits take to their heels without any booty\".155. Even in such a case all the dacoits can be convicted and punished under section 395, IPC, 1860.156. In a case of dacoity the circumstance that the inmates of the house, seeing the large number of dacoits, do not offer any resistance and no force or violence is required or used does not reduce the dacoity to theft.157.",

COMMENT— This section imposes severe punishment when hurt is caused in committing robbery. Section 397 similarly provides for the minimum sentence of imprisonment which must be inﬂicted when grievous hurt is caused. Commenting on the section, the Supreme Court observed: section 394 prescribes punishment for voluntarily causing hurt in committing or attempting to commit robbery. The offence under section 394 is a more serious than one under section 392. Section 394 postulates and contemplates the causing of harm during commission of robbery or in attempting to commit robbery when such causing of hurt is hardly necessary to facilitate the commission of robbery. Section 394 applies to cases where during the course of robbery voluntary hurt is caused. Section 394 classiﬁes two distinct classes of persons. Firstly, those who actually cause hurt and secondly, those who do not actually cause hurt but are \"jointly concerned\" in the commission of the offence of robbery. The second class of persons may not be concerned in the causing of hurt, but they become liable independently of the knowledge of its likelihood or a reasonable belief in its probability.178. In a prosecution for robbery and murder, injuries were caused to the deceased in the process of removing earrings. The Court said that the fact that the booty was distributed among three accused and they had secreted the robbed articles. These things revealed the common intention to commit robbery.

COMMENT— 188..—When a person is involved in an offence of theft of higher magnitude, then it  becomes dacoity and when dacoity is committed with murder and also results in causing grievous hurt to others, it becomes robbery punishable under sections 395, section 396 and section 397 of IPC, 1860. In other words, when the offence of theft is committed conjointly by ﬁve or more persons, it becomes dacoity and such dacoity by those persons also results in commission of murder as well as causing of grievous hurt to the victims, it results in an offence of robbery.

In other words, when the offence of theft is committed conjointly by ﬁve or more persons, it becomes dacoity and such dacoity by those persons also results in commission of murder as well as causing of grievous hurt to the victims, it results in an offence of robbery.

In any case, sentence of ﬁve years rigorous imprisonment awarded by the trial Court and conﬁrmed in appeal by the High Court for the offence under section 395 IPC, 1860 calls for no interference.191. Considering that the value of the alleged loot including cash and mobile was only Rs. 16,550 and the young age of the accused, the trial Court sentenced him to rigorous imprisonment of only one year along with a ﬁne of Rs. 100. The High Court allowed the appeal to the extent of enhancing the sentence to ﬁve years of rigorous imprisonment along with the ﬁne imposed by the trial Court. Considering the same reasons as recorded by the trial Court the Supreme Court reduced the sentence of imprisonment to the extent already undergone, i.e., three years and two months.192."

            "sub_section_description": "The offence under this section requires two things:— (1) The dacoity must be the joint act of the persons concerned. (2) Murder must have been committed in the course of the commission of the  dacoity.195. Section 391 IPC, 1860 explains the offence of 'dacoity'. When ﬁve or more persons conjointly commit or attempt to commit a robbery, or where the whole number of persons conjointly committing or attempting to commit a robbery, and persons present and aiding such commission and attempt amount to ﬁve or more, every person so committing, attempting or aiding, is said to commit 'dacoity'. Under section 392 IPC, 1860, the offence of 'robbery' simpliciter is punishable with rigorous imprisonment which may extend to ten years or 14 years depending upon the facts of a given case. Section 396 IPC, 1860 brings within its ambit a murder committed along with 'dacoity'. In terms of this provision, if any one of the ﬁve or more persons, who are conjointly committing dacoity, commits murder in so committing dacoity, every one of those persons shall be punished with death or imprisonment for life or rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years and shall also be liable to ﬁne.196. In the ﬁrst instance, what is to be examined is whether the basic ingredient of the offence falling under sections 395, 396 and 397 of IPC, 1860, namely, participation of ﬁve or more persons was made out.197. On a plain reading of these provisions, it is   clear that to constitute an offence of 'dacoity', robbery essentially should be committed by ﬁve or more persons. Similarly, to constitute an offence of 'dacoity with murder' any one of the ﬁve or more persons should commit a murder while committing the dacoity, then every one of such persons so committing, attempting to commit or aiding, by ﬁction of law, would be deemed to have committed the offence of murder and be liable for punishment provided under these provisions depending upon the facts and circumstances of the case.198. For recording conviction for dacoity, there must be ﬁve or more persons. In the absence of such ﬁnding, an accused cannot be convicted for dacoity. In a given case, however, it may happen that there may be ﬁve or more persons and the factum of ﬁve or more persons is either not disputed or is clearly established, but the Court may not be able to record a ﬁnding as to identity of all the persons said to have committed the dacoity and may not be able to convict them and order their acquittal observing that their identity is not established. In such case, conviction of less than ﬁve persons—or even one—can stand. But in the absence of such ﬁnding, less than ﬁve persons cannot be convicted for dacoity. A similar situation arises in dealing with cases of \"unlawful assembly\" as deﬁned in section 141 IPC, 1860 and liability of every member of such unlawful assembly for an offence committed in prosecution of common object under section 149 IPC, 1860. In this case there were six accused. Out of those six accused, two were acquitted by the trial Court without recording a ﬁnding that though offence of dacoity was committed by six persons, identity of two accused could not be established. They were simply acquitted by the Court. Therefore, as per settled law, four persons could not be convicted for dacoity, being less than ﬁve which is an essential ingredient for commission of dacoity. Moreover, all of them were acquitted for an offence of criminal conspiracy punishable under section 120-B IPC, 1860 as also for receiving stolen property in the commission of dacoity punishable under section 412 IPC, 1860. The conviction of the appellant in this case for an offence punishable under section 396 IPC, 1860, therefore, could not stand and must be set aside.199."

When in the commission of a dacoity a murder is committed, it matters not whether the particular dacoit was inside the house where the dacoity is committed, or outside the house, or whether the murder was committed inside or outside the house, so long only as the murder was committed in the commission of that dacoity.200. The essence of an offence under this section is murder committed in commission of dacoity. It does not matter whether murder is committed in the immediate presence of a particular person or persons. It is not even necessary that murder should have been within the previous contemplation of the perpetrators of the crime.201. But in a case the dacoits were forced to retreat without collecting any booty, the offence of dacoity would be completed as soon as they left the house of occurrence and took to their heels. And if a murder was committed by any one of the dacoits in course of such a retreat without any booty, then only the actual murderer will be liable under section 302, IPC, 1860, and conjoint responsibility under section 396, IPC, 1860, could not be ﬁxed on others though all of them could be convicted under section 395, IPC, 1860 as attempt to commit dacoity is also dacoity.202."

But, as already noticed, to attract the provisions of section 396, the offence of 'dacoity' must be coupled with murder. In other words, the ingredients of section 302 become an integral part of the offences punishable under section 396 of the IPC, 1860. Resultantly, the distinction with regard to the number of persons involved in the commission of the crime loses its signiﬁcance as it is possible that the offence of 'dacoity' may not be proved but still the offence of murder could be established, like in the present case. Upon reasonable analysis of the language of these provisions, it is clear that the Court has to keep in mind the ingredients which shall constitute a criminal offence within the meaning of the penal section. This is not only essential in the case of the offence charged with but even where there is comparative study of different penal provisions as the accused may have committed more than one offence or even offences of a graver nature. He may ﬁnally be punished for a lesser offence or vice versa, if the law so permits and the requisite ingredients are satisﬁed.207. On the conjoint reading of sections 396 and 302 IPC, 1860, it is clear that the offence of murder has been lifted and incorporated in the provisions of section 396 IPC, 1860. In other words, the offence of murder punishable under section 302 and as deﬁned under section 300 will have to be read into the provisions of offences stated under section 396 IPC, 1860. In other words, where a provision is physically lifted and made part of another provision, it shall fall within the ambit and scope of principle akin to 'legislation by incorporation' which normally is   applied between an existing statute and a newly enacted law. The expression 'murder' appearing in section 396 would have to take necessarily in its ambit and scope the ingredients of section 300 of the IPC, 1860. The provisions are clear and admit no scope for application of any other principle of interpretation except the 'golden rule of construction', i.e., to read the statutory language grammatically and terminologically in the ordinary and primary sense which it appears in its context without omission or addition. These provisions read collectively, put the matter beyond ambiguity that the offence of murder, is by speciﬁc language, included in the offences under section 396. It will have the same connotation, meaning and ingredients as are contemplated under the provisions of section 302 IPC, 1860.208."

COMMENT— This section can regulate the punishment only in cases of an attempt to commit robbery as distinguished from a case in which the offender has accomplished his purpose and robbery has actually been committed.231. It applies to such of the offenders as are armed with deadly weapons though they do not use them in the attempt to rob or commit dacoity. It does not apply to other offenders who in combination with such persons have committed robbery or dacoity.232. The words \"uses\" and \"is armed\" in sections 397 and 398, IPC, 1860, have to be given identical meaning to resolve apparent anomaly.233. Thus, carrying a deadly weapon would be enough to attract the mischief of either section. In the charge-sheet, accused were charged under section 396. Section 398 is referred only for the purpose of sentence. Hence, the argument that when section 398 is attracted, life imprisonment cannot be awarded is untenable. Substantive offence here is section 396. But, if section 398 is attracted, minimum punishment shall be seven years. Sections 397 and 398 cannot be used conjunctively or constructively as held by the Apex Court in Paramjeet Singh v State of Rajasthan.234. In fact, as held in various Court decisions, a person cannot be convicted under section 398 unless he is armed with a deadly weapon while committing or attempting to commit robbery or dacoity.235. Section 398, IPC, 1860 gets attracted if at the time of attempting to commit robbery or dacoity, the offender is armed with a deadly weapon which will attract an imprisonment not less than seven years. When no robbery or dacoity has been committed as such, in the sense that no property was removed from the house of the complainants and nothing said to be belonging to the complainants was recovered, it would be diﬃcult to hold that there was any attempt in regard to the commission of robbery or dacoity. Scattering of articles in the house may cause a scene as if ransacked, but that does not proved the charge.236. For the offence of attempt to commit robbery the maximum punishment prescribed by law is rigorous imprisonment for seven years with ﬁne. However the discretion is left to the Court to quantify the actual sentence to be awarded. However, if at the time of attempting to commit robbery the offender is armed with any deadly weapon, the offence becomes more serious or aggravated and therefore, section 398 provides that in such circumstances the imprisonment with which, the offender shall be punishable, shall not be less than seven years. If at the time of committing robbery the offender is not armed with any deadly weapon the Court may award sentence of imprisonment for a term up to seven years and if he was   armed with deadly weapon the sentence of imprisonment shall not be less than seven years. In such circumstances the maximum sentence of rigorous imprisonment of seven years has to be awarded. It is well settled that section 398 IPC, 1860 does not create any offence but merely regulates the punishment already provided for robbery or dacoity. One cannot be convicted and sentenced separately under sections 393 and 398 of IPC, 1860.237.",

The words \"uses\" and \"is armed\" in sections 397 and 398, IPC, 1860, have to be given identical meaning to resolve apparent anomaly.233. Thus, carrying a deadly weapon would be enough to attract the mischief of either section. In the charge-sheet, accused were charged under section 396. Section 398 is referred only for the purpose of sentence. Hence, the argument that when section 398 is attracted, life imprisonment cannot be awarded is untenable. Substantive offence here is section 396. But, if section 398 is attracted, minimum punishment shall be seven years. Sections 397 and 398 cannot be used conjunctively or constructively as held by the Apex Court in Paramjeet Singh v State of Rajasthan.234. In fact, as held in various Court decisions, a person cannot be convicted under section 398 unless he is armed with a deadly weapon while committing or attempting to commit robbery or dacoity.235. Section 398, IPC, 1860 gets attracted if at the time of attempting to commit robbery or dacoity, the offender is armed with a deadly weapon which will attract an imprisonment not less than seven years. When no robbery or dacoity has been committed as such, in the sense that no property was removed from the house of the complainants and nothing said to be belonging to the complainants was recovered, it would be diﬃcult to hold that there was any attempt in regard to the commission of robbery or dacoity. Scattering of articles in the house may cause a scene as if ransacked, but that does not proved the charge.236. For the offence of attempt to commit robbery the maximum punishment prescribed by law is rigorous imprisonment for seven years with ﬁne. However the discretion is left to the Court to quantify the actual sentence to be awarded. However, if at the time of attempting to commit robbery the offender is armed with any deadly weapon, the offence becomes more serious or aggravated and therefore, section 398 provides that in such circumstances the imprisonment with which, the offender shall be punishable, shall not be less than seven years. If at the time of committing robbery the offender is not armed with any deadly weapon the Court may award sentence of imprisonment for a term up to seven years and if he was   armed with deadly weapon the sentence of imprisonment shall not be less than seven years. In such circumstances the maximum sentence of rigorous imprisonment of seven years has to be awarded. It is well settled that section 398 IPC, 1860 does not create any offence but merely regulates the punishment already provided for robbery or dacoity. One cannot be convicted and sentenced separately under sections 393 and 398 of IPC, 1860.237.",

The prosecution has to establish under section 402, IPC, 1860 that there had been an assembly of ﬁve or more persons constituted for the purpose of committing dacoity and that the accused persons were members of that assembly. If there is no clear and acceptable evidence of any assemblage of the appellants with three or more persons   for the purpose of committing dacoity then the appellants cannot be held liable under section 402, IPC, 1860.243."

            "sub_section_description": "A culprit ﬁrst intends to commit the offence, then makes preparation for committing it and thereafter attempts to commit the offence. If the attempt succeeds, he has committed the offence; if it fails due to reasons beyond his control, he is said to have attempted to commit the offence. Attempt to commit an offence can be said to begin when the preparations are complete and the culprit commences to do something with the intention of committing the offence and which is a step towards the commission of the offence. The moment he commences to do an act with the necessary Intention, he commences his attempt to commit the offence. The word \"attempt\" is not itself deﬁned, and must, therefore, be taken in its ordinary meaning. This is exactly what the provisions of section 511 require. An attempt to commit a crime is to be distinguished from an intention to commit it and from preparation made for its commission. Mere intention to commit an offence, not followed by any act, cannot constitute an offence. The will is not be taken for the deed unless there be some external act which shows that progress, has been made in the direction of it, or towards maturing and effecting it. Intention is the direction of conduct towards the object chosen upon considering the motives which suggest the choice. Preparation consists in devising or arranging the means or measures necessary for the commission of the offence. It differs widely from attempt which is the direct movement towards the commission after preparations are made. Preparation to commit an offence is punishable only when the preparation is to commit offences under section 122 (waging war against the Government of India) and section 399 (preparation to commit dacoity). The dividing, line between a mere preparation and an attempt is sometimes thin and has to be decided on the facts of each case. There is a greater degree of determination in attempt as compared with preparation.244."

COMMENT— This section provides for the punishment of those who belong to a gang of persons who make it their business to commit dacoity. Its object is to break up gangs of dacoits by punishing persons associated for the purpose of committing dacoity.

The expression 'belong' implies something more than casual association for the purpose of committing one or two dacoities by a person who was ordinarily living by honest means. It refers to those persons who habitually associate with a gang of dacoits and actively assist them in their operations. But if a person with a bad past record participates in the commission of dacoity even on one occasion in association with a well-known gang of habitual dacoits knowing them to be such a gang, it may be reasonably inferred that he belongs to that gang unless there is some other material on record to justify an inference that the association was of a casual nature.251.

ILLUSTRATIONS (a) A takes property belonging to Z out of Z's possession, in good faith, believing, at  the time when he takes it, that the property belongs to himself. A is not guilty of theft; but if A, after discovering his mistake, dishonestly appropriates the property to his own use, he is guilty of an offence under this section. (b) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence, and takes  away a book without Z's express consent. Here, if A was under the impression that he had Z's implied consent to take the book for the purpose of reading it, A has not committed theft. But, if A afterwards sells the book for his own beneﬁt, he is guilty of an offence under this section. (c) A and B, being joint owners of a horse, A takes the horse out of B's possession,  intending to use it. Here, as A has a right to use the horse, he does not dishonestly misappropriate it. But, if A sells the horse and appropriates the whole proceeds to his own use, he is guilty of an offence under this section. Explanation 1.—A dishonest misappropriation for a time only is a misappropriation within the meaning of this section. ILLUSTRATION A ﬁnds a Government promissory note belonging to Z, bearing a blank endorsement. A, knowing that the note belongs to Z, pledges it with a banker as a security for a loan, intending at a future time to restore it to Z. A has committed an offence under this section. Explanation 2.—A person who ﬁnds property not in the possession of any other person, and takes such property for the purpose of protecting it for, or of restoring it to, the owner does not take or misappropriate it dishonestly, and is not guilty of an offence; but he is guilty of the offence above deﬁned, if he appropriates it to his own use, when he knows or has the means of discovering the owner, or before he has used reasonable means to discover and give notice to the owner and has kept the property a reasonable time to enable the owner to claim it. What are reasonable means or what is a reasonable time in such a case, is a question of fact.   It is not necessary that the ﬁnder should know who is the owner of the property, or that any particular person is the owner of it; it is suﬃcient if, at the time of appropriating it, he does not believe it to be his own property, or in good faith believes that the real owner cannot be found. ILLUSTRATIONS (a) A ﬁnds a rupee on the high road, not knowing to whom the rupee belongs. A  picks up the rupee. Here A has not committed the offence deﬁned in this section. (b) A ﬁnds a letter on the road, containing a banknote. From the direction and  contents of the letter he learns to whom the note belongs. He appropriates the note. He is guilty of an offence under this section. (c) A ﬁnds a cheque payable to bearer. He can form no conjecture as to the person  who has lost the cheque. But the name of the person, who has drawn the cheque, appears. A knows that this person can direct him to the person in whose favour the cheque was drawn. A appropriates the cheque without attempting to discover the owner. He is guilty of an offence under this section. (d) A sees Z drop his purse with money in it. A picks up the purse with the intention  of restoring it to Z, but afterwards appropriates it to his own use. A has committed an offence under this section. (e) A ﬁnds a purse with money, not knowing to whom it belongs; he afterwards  discovers that it belongs to Z, and appropriates it to his own use. A is guilty of an offence under this section. (f) A ﬁnds a valuable ring, not knowing to whom it belongs. A sells it immediately  without attempting to discover the owner. A is guilty of an offence under this section.  COMMENT— Criminal misappropriation takes place when the possession has been innocently come by, but where, by a subsequent change of intention, or from the knowledge of some new fact with which the party was not previously acquainted, the retaining becomes wrongful and fraudulent.257.

Z going on a journey, entrusts his furniture to A, under  a contract that it shall be returned on payment of a stipulated sum for warehouse room. A dishonestly sells the goods.

COMMENT— The basic requirement to bring home the accusations under section 405 are the requirements to prove conjointly i) entrustment and ii) whether the accused was actuated by dishonest intention or not, misappropriated it or converted it to his own use to the detriment of the persons who entrusted it.282. Two distinct parts are involved in the commission of the offence of criminal breach of trust. The ﬁrst part consists of the creation of an obligation in relation to the property over which dominion or control is acquired by the accused. The second is the misappropriation or dealing with the property dishonestly and contrary to the terms of the obligation created.283. A trust contemplated by section 405 would arise only when there is an entrustment of property or dominion over property. There has, therefore, to be a property belonging to someone which is entrusted to the person accused of the offence under section 405. The entrustment of property creates a trust which is only an obligation annexed to the ownership of the property and arises out of a conﬁdence reposed and accepted by the owner.284. However, it must be borne in mind that section 405 IPC, 1860 does not contemplate the creation of a trust with all the technicalities of the law of trust. It contemplates the creation of a relationship whereby the owner of property makes it over to another person to be retained by him until a certain contingency arises or to be disposed of by him on the happening of a certain event.285.",

Such an act must not only be done dishonestly but also in violation of any direction of law or any contract express or implied relating to carrying out the trust.286.

Thus to prosecute a partner the prosecution must establish that dominion over the assets or a particular asset of the partnership was by a special agreement between the parties, entrusted to the accused partner.

When dispute between the parties constitute only a civil wrong and not a criminal wrong, the Courts would not permit a person to be harassed although no case for taking cognizance of the offence has been made out336. An act of breach of trust simpliciter involves a civil wrong of which the person wronged may seek his redress for damages in a civil Court but a breach of trust with mens rea gives rise to a criminal prosecution as well. The element of 'dishonest intention' is therefore, an essential element to constitute the offence of Criminal Breach of Trust.337. Breach of trust may be basically a civil wrong, but it gives rise to criminal liability also when there is mens rea.338. The difference between the two lies in dishonest intention.339. If there is a ﬂavour of civil nature, the same cannot be agitated in the form of criminal proceeding. If there is huge delay and in order to avoid the period of limitation, it cannot be resorted to a criminal proceeding.340. A civil suit was ﬁled alleging negligence and breach of contractual obligations. The Court said that a breach of contract simpliciter does not constitute any offence. The criminal complaint must disclose the ingredients of the offence. For ascertaining the prima facie correctness of the allegations the Court can look at the correspondence between the parties and other admitted documents. Criminal proceedings should not be encouraged when they are found to be mala ﬁde or otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court.341. Merely because a civil claim has been raised by the complainant regarding the breach of agreement, it cannot prevent him from initiating criminal proceedings.342. Though a case of breach of trust may be both a civil wrong and a criminal offence but there would be certain situations where it would predominantly be a civil wrong and may or may not amount to a criminal offence. The present case is one of that type where, if at all, the facts may constitute a civil wrong and the ingredients of the criminal offences are wanting. Having regard to the relevant documents including the trust deed as also the correspondence following the creation of the tenancy, the submissions advanced on behalf of the parties, the natural relationship between the settlor and the trustee as mother and son and the fall out in their relationship and the fact that the wife of the co-trustee was no more interested in the tenancy, it must be held that the criminal case should not be continued.343.

What amounts to criminal breach of trust is provided under section 405, IPC, 1860. The basic requirement to bring home the accusations under section 405 are the requirements to prove conjointly (i) entrustment and (ii) whether the accused was actuated by dishonest intention or not, misappropriated it or converted it to his own use to the detriment of the persons who entrusted it.368. Merely because the accused allegedly kept the amount in deﬁance of the oﬃcial instruction, it cannot be an incriminating circumstance to arrive at a conclusion that he has committed the breach of trust. It is a settled position of law that suspicion howsoever grave cannot take the place of proof.369. The section cannot be construed as implying that any head of an oﬃce that is negligent in seeing that the rules about remitting money to the treasury are observed is ipso facto guilty of criminal breach of trust; but something more than that is required to bring home the dishonest intention. There should be some indication which justiﬁes a ﬁnding that the accused deﬁnitely had the intention of wrongfully keeping Government out of the moneys.370. Subjecting to a civil liability would thus attract one of the ingredients of criminal breach of trust. There cannot be, however, any doubt whatsoever that a mere error of judgment would not attract the penal provision   contained in section 409 of the IPC, 1860.371. the fact that the accused puts back the money,372. or promises to do so,373. does not wipe out the offence or absolve him from liability. Where a post-master misappropriated the money entrusted to him but paid back the whole amount before being challenged, his acquittal on this ground was held to be wrong.374. But the Courts do take that fact into account as a mitigating factor and would consider light punishment as suﬃcient to meet the ends of justice.375. Where certain articles disappeared from an open godown which was being watched by a Chowkidar (watchman), it was held that the over-all incharge overseer could not be held liable under the section unless there was the proof that the articles disappeared because of his doings or non-doings.376. The offence under the section requires criminal intent or mens rea. Where in the matter of post oﬃce deposit accounts, all that was proved showed that there was negligence in maintaining them, the Court said that it could be a ﬁt case for departmental proceedings but not proceedings under section 409 because the intention to misappropriate the proceeds of the accounts was not in evidence.377."

It was held that question of misappropriation of funds does not arise.415.

Thus, in 'criminal breach of trust', the intention of the accused cannot be dishonest or mala ﬁde at the time, when he comes into possession of the property or comes to acquire dominion over the property; but, having come into possession of, or having acquired dominion over, the property, the accused develops dishonest intention and actuated by such mens rea, he converts to his own use the property or dishonestly uses or disposes of the property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal contract, express or implied, which he has made touching the discharge of such trust, or wilfully suffers any other person so to do. Contrary to what happens in \"criminal breach of trust\", the intention of the accused, in a case or \"cheating\", is dishonest from the very commencement of the transaction. There is really no consent by the person, who is intentionally induced by deception to deliver the property or allow any person to retain the property or is intentionally induced, as a result of deception, to do or omit to do anything, which he would not do or omit to do if he were not so deceived, and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body, mind, reputation or property.

The Penal Code does not contain any provision for attaching vicarious liability on the part of the Managing Director or the Directors of the Company when the accused is the Company. The learned Magistrate failed to pose unto himself the correct question, viz., as to whether the complaint petition, even if given face value and taken to be correct in its entirety, would lead to the conclusion that the respondents herein were personally liable for any offence. The Bank is a body corporate. Vicarious liability of the Managing Director and Director would arise provided any provision exists in that behalf in the Statute. Statutes indisputably must contain provision ﬁxing such vicarious liabilities. Even for the said purpose, it is obligatory on the part of the complainant to make requisite allegations which would attract the provisions constituting vicarious liability.431. In the case of Punjab National Bank v Surendra Prasad Sinha,432. a complaint was lodged by the complainant for prosecution under sections 409, 109 and 114, IPC, 1860 against the Chairman, the Managing Director of the Bank and a host of oﬃcers Since the principal debtor defaulted in payment of debt, the Branch Manager of the bank on maturity of the said ﬁxed deposit adjusted a part of the amount against the said loan. The complainant alleged that the debt became barred by limitation and, therefore, the liability of the guarantors also stood extinguished. It was, therefore, alleged that the oﬃcers of the bank criminally embezzled the said amount with dishonest intention to save themselves from ﬁnancial obligation. The Magistrate without adverting whether the allegations in the complaint prima facie make out an offence charged for, in a mechanical manner, issued the process against all the accused persons. The High Court refused to quash the complaint and the matter ﬁnally came to Supreme Court. The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, quashed the proceedings and held that the complaint was laid impleading the Chairman, the Managing Director of the Bank by name and a host of oﬃcers. There lies responsibility and duty on the Magistracy to ﬁnd whether the concerned accused should be legally responsible for the offence charged for. Only on satisfying that the law casts liability or creates offence against the juristic person or the persons impleaded then only process would be issued."

A property is stolen for the purpose of this section when its possession is transferred by theft, extortion, robbery, dacoity or criminal breach of trust or which was obtained under misappropriation committed whether in India or outside. An extended meaning is given to the words 'stolen property' which are used in the four subsequent sections. Not only things which have been stolen, extorted or robbed but also things which have been obtained by criminal misappropriation or criminal breach of trust are within the meaning assigned to these words. Section 411 provides punishment to the person who dishonestly receives stolen property. The person must have the knowledge that it is a stolen property. This section as also the succeeding sections are directed not against the principal offender, e.g., a thief, robber or misappropriator but against the class of persons who trade in stolen articles and are receivers of stolen property. Principal offenders are therefore, outside the scope of this section.

A person who dishonestly receives property and retains it, must obviously continue to retain it.

(2) That some person other than the accused had possession of the property  before the accused got possession of it and (3) That the accused had knowledge that the property was stolen.445.

Where properties looted in a dacoity were found in the possession of the accused who was the resident of the neighbouring village within three days of the occurrence, it was held that it could be presumed that he had known or had reason to believe that the properties were the stolen properties of the dacoity and as such his conviction under section 412, IPC, 1860, was quite in order.460.

Explanation.—A dishonest concealment of facts is a deception within the meaning of this section.

A   cheats; but if A, at the time of obtaining the money, intends to deliver the indigo plant, and afterwards breaks his contract and does not deliver it, he does not cheat, but is liable only to a civil action for breach of contract.

COMMENT— In most of the foregoing offences relating to property the offender merely got possession of the thing in question, but in the case of cheating he obtains possession plus property in it. The authors of the Code observe: \"We propose to make it cheating to obtain property by deception in all cases where the property is fraudulently obtained; that is to say, in all cases where the intention of the person who has by deceit obtained the property was to cause a distribution of property which the law pronounces to be a wrongful distribution, and in no other case whatever. However immoral a deception may be, we do not consider it as an offence against the rights of property if its object is only to cause a distribution of property which the law recognizes as rightful. \"We propose to punish as guilty of cheating a man who, by false representations, obtains a loan of money, not meaning to repay it; a man who, by false representations, obtains an advance of money, not meaning to perform the service or to deliver the article for which the advance is given; a man who, by falsely pretending to have performed work for which he was hired, obtains pay to which he is not entitled. \"In all these cases there is deception. In all, the deceiver's object is fraudulent. He intends in all these cases to acquire or retain wrongful possession of that to which some other person has a better claim and which that other person is entitled to recover by law. In all these cases, therefore, the object has been wrongful gain, attended with wrongful loss. In all, therefore, there has, according to our deﬁnition, been cheating\".472.",

The second class of acts set-forth in the section is the doing or omitting to do anything which the person deceived would not do or omit to do if he were not so deceived. In the ﬁrst class of cases the inducing must be fraudulent or dishonest. In the second class of acts, the inducing must be intentional but not fraudulent or dishonest.474.

It depends upon the intention of the accused at the time of inducement which may be judged by his subsequent conduct, but for which the subsequent conduct is not the sole test. Mere breach of contract cannot give rise to criminal prosecution under section 420, IPC, 1860, unless fraudulent or dishonest intention is shown right at the beginning of the transaction, which is the time when the offence is said to have been committed.477. There was allegation from one side that no payment was being made under the contract. The other side pleaded that part payments were made from time to time and the balance was withheld due to non-standard nature of the work and a letter to that effect was issued. The Court said that the controversy was wholly of civil nature. There was total absence of dishonest criminal intention to dupe contractions' right from the inception of the relationship.478. Although breach of contract per se would not come in the way of initiation of a criminal proceeding, there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that in absence of the averments made in the complaint petition wherefrom the ingredients of an offence can be found out, the Court should not hesitate to exercise its jurisdiction under section 482 of the Cr PC, 1973.479. The distinction was explained by the Supreme Court in a case involving an agreement for sale of property. The allegation in the complaint was that the seller had not disclosed that one of his brothers had ﬁled a partition suit which was pending. There   was no allegation that non-disclosure of the suit was intentional. The dishonest intention on the part of the accused at the beginning of negotiations was not made out by averments in the complaint. The High Court was wrong in declining to quash the criminal proceedings.480. The accused promised, propagated and induced the public through advertisements to invest money in a circulation scheme. Double the money was promised to a member who enrolled 14 new members. The scheme was found to be practically impossible. Thus there was an element of cheating.481."

A beverages company entered into a bottling agreement with a bottling company for bottling services for a period of ﬁve years, subsequently, however, the beverage company transferred its trade mark to another company to which the bottling agreement was also assigned. But the latter company terminated the agreement. The bottling company ﬁled a complaint for cheating saying that they had spent a huge amount in setting up their bottling unit. The complaint was quashed. There was no arrangement with the beverages company at the time when the complainant was bringing up his unit, nor did the beverages company have any intention of cheating from the start or at any subsequent stage.501. Although it is necessary that there should be misrepresentation from the very beginning, the intention to cheat may in some cases develop at a later stage in the process of formation of the contract. The respondent in this case was a co-sharer in the joint property. The other co-sharers sold it to others representing that they had onethird share in the property when in fact it was not so. It was held that no cheating was practiced in the transaction upon the complaining co-sharer. It was a fraud on others. The complainant could not launch a criminal prosecution against them.502. The illustration (b) provided in section 415, IPC, 1860, very well covers the facts of this case for cheating by the accused. The illustration provides that \"(b) A, by putting a counterfoil mark on an article, intentionally deceives Z into a belief that this article was made in a certain celebrated manufacturer, and thus dishonestly induces Z to buy and pay for the article, A cheats.\"503."

There is no immunity to the companies from prosecution merely because the prosecution is in respect of offences for which the punishment prescribed is mandatory imprisonment.518.

In fact, many a cheatings were committed in the course of commercial and also money transactions. One of the illustrations set out under section 415 of the IPC, 1860 (Illustration f) is worthy of notice now \"(f) A intentionally deceives Z into a belief that A means to repay any money that Z may lend to him and thereby dishonestly induces Z to lend him money, A not intending to repay it. A cheats.\"528. On its plain language it is manifest from this illustration that what is material is the intention of the drawer at the time the cheque is issued, and the intention has to be gathered from the facts on the record. If from the circumstances it is established that the failure to meet a cheque was not accidental but was the consequence expected by the accused, the presumption would be that the accused intended to cheat.529. The accused introduced a person to the bank only for opening an account. It was held that such act could not by itself spell out any intention to commit fraud or cheating. The evidence did not show that the introducer was in any way connected with the fraud committed on the bank by the person introduced or with the loss suffered by the bank. He was accordingly acquitted of all charges.530."

The Court held that as it is wellsettled law that a criminal's culpable offence shall not be inherited by his heirs.

This section deals with a physical injury from a physical cause.607. Section 426, IPC, 1860 deals with punishment for the offence of \"mischief\" as deﬁned in section 425.

Neither malice nor an intention to cause injury is essential for the constitution of the offence which may be committed by injury caused with only the knowledge of likelihood, which must, however, he strictly proved. The ﬁrst part of the section sets out the mens rea on the guilty mind, which is the intention or the knowledge of likelihood of causing wrongful loss or damage to the public or to any person. The second part of the section pertains to the actus res, that is to say, the criminal act, which consists in causing destruction to any property or any such change in any property or in the situation thereof as destroys or diminishes its value or utility or affects it injuriously. The express mention of \"damage\" in the section is indicative of the fact that the purview of the offence of \"mischief\" is not intended to be conﬁned only to cases of \"wrongful loss\", but also to engulf within it all such cases of damages by unlawful means. Destruction of any property within the meaning of the section carries with it the implication that something should be done to the property contrary to its natural use and serviceableness.

'Intend to cause, or knowing that he is likely to cause, wrongful loss or damage to the public or to any person'.—This section does not necessarily contemplate damage of a destructive character. It requires merely that there should be an invasion of right and diminution of the value of one's property, caused by that invasion of right, which must have been contemplated by the doer of it when he did it.611. A dominant owner, having a right of way over land belonging to another, has no right himself to remove an obstruction unless his right of way is impaired by it. If he does so, he has employed unlawful means and if loss of property is caused thereby to another, he is guilty under this section.612. It is no answer to a charge of mischief to plead that the motive of the accused was to beneﬁt himself, and not to injure another, if he knew that he could only secure that beneﬁt by causing wrongful loss to another.613. Where while taking possession of the allotted portion of a house on the basis of a valid allotment order, the goods were simply put outside the premises and no obstruction was caused to the complainant landlord to collect his goods, offences under sections 425 and 427 were not made out.614. 2. 'Causes the destruction of any property or any such change in any property, etc.'.—It is the essence of this offence that the perpetrator must cause the destruction of property or such change in it as destroys or diminishes its value or utility. The destruction of a document evidencing an agreement void for immorality constitutes this offence as it can be used as evidence for other collateral purposes.615. The accused on receiving delivery of a registered article from a Postmaster was requested to sign an acknowledgement for the article received by him, but instead of returning the same duly signed he tore it up and threw it on the ground. It was held that he was guilty of mischief.616. The 'destruction' or 'change' should be contrary to the natural use and serviceableness of the property in question. If a person unauthorisedly allows goats to graze in a forest, the grazing rights in which are restricted to holders of permits, the offence of mischief is not committed as by such an act the grass is only put to its normal use.617. The accused had a dispute about the possession of a certain land with the complainant. The complainant dug a well with a view to cultivate the said land, but the accused forcibly entered on the land and damaged the well. It was held that accused were guilty of mischief even though the complainant was a trespasser.618. Merely disconnecting electric supply does not amount to destruction of property or to such a change in property as destroys or diminishes its utility or value, and does not constitute an offence of mischief.619. A contrary view to this view of the Calcutta High Court has been taken by the Delhi High Court to say that switching off the electric supply by the landlord to the tenanted premises, even without causing damage to the distribution board or wires supplying electric current diminishes the value and utility of the tenanted premises within the meaning of section 425, IPC, 1860.620. In order to make out an offence of mischief it is necessary to show that there was wrongful loss or damage to the property. So unless the property was destroyed or underwent such a change due to the action of the accused that its utility or value was diminished, no offence under section 425, IPC, 1860, could be said to have been committed. Thus where a family took shelter in the door-way of an uninhabitable and dilapidated house by throwing away a few articles, the offence of mischief was not committed.621. Cutting off the water supply constitutes such destructive change in the ﬂat as diminishes its value or utility.622.",

Where a person owns land on which there is a drain, the water running through which is used as of right by way of easement by another person, the former is not guilty of mischief, if the drain is destroyed by him because an easement does not come within the purview of 'property' within the meaning of section 425.624.

Where a landlord, in breach of an agreement with his tenants, omitted to pump water into their ﬂats from a central reservoir without, however, interfering in any way with their taking water from the central reservoir, such omission did not constitute such a change as would make it \"mischief\" within the meaning of this section.627. There is a contrary view to this which holds that cutting off the water supply does constitute an offence of mischief.628. So also would be the case in regard to cutting off the supply of electricity by the landlord to the tenanted portion of the house.629. This latter view appears to be more reasonable."

Same as in Uttar Pradesh except that for the words \"whether before or after the coming into force of the Criminal Laws (U.P.

For Section 441, substitute the following:— \"441. Criminal Trespass.—Whoever enters into or upon property in possession of another with intent to commit an offence or to intimidate, insult or annoy any person in possession of such property, or, having lawfully entered into or upon such property, unlawfully remains there with intent thereby to intimidate, insult or annoy any such person, or with intent to commit an offence, or, having entered into or upon such property, whether before or after the coming into force of the Criminal Law (U.P.

It is a transgression of law or right, and a trespasser is a person, entering the premises of another with the knowledge that his entrance is in   excess of the permission that has been given to him.649. The authors of the Code say: \"We have given the name of trespass to every usurpation, however slight, of dominion over property. We do not propose to make trespass, as such, an offence, except when it is committed in order to the commission of some offence injurious to some person interested in the property on which the trespass is committed, or for the purpose of causing annoyance to such a person. Even then we propose to visit it with a light punishment, unless it is attended with aggravating circumstances\".650.",

Bona ﬁde claim of right, however ill-founded, nulliﬁes a case of criminal trespass.664. Where certain hutment dwellers of Bombay were facing demolition for having erected their huts on public footpaths and pavements, the Supreme Court held that no offence under the section was made out. Their act was not voluntary. It was the dictate of their moral right to survive and their state of helplessness. They did not intend to commit an offence or to intimidate, insult or annoy any person in possession and that is the gist of the offence of criminal trespass under section 441.665. Where the accused continued in possession of the tenanted premises even after the expiry of the lease period, he could not be said to be in unauthorised possession and to have committed trespass.666."

Ordinarily, a dispute between the tenant and the landlord regarding vacation of a premise after expiry of the period of tenancy is a civil dispute, unless an offence of criminal trespass can be said to have been committed. Prosecution against the tenant would not lie except the cases covered by the Orissa Amendment. Section 441, IPC, 1860, which has been deﬁned by Orissa Act, 22 of 1986, is quoted hereunder for better appreciation: ....... Whoever enters into or upon property in possession of another with intent to commit an offence or to intimidate, insult or annoy any person in possession of such property. Or having lawfully entered into or upon such property, unlawfully remains there with intent thereby to intimidate, insult or annoy any such person or with intent to commit an offence; or having lawfully entered into or upon such property, remains there with the intention of taking unauthorised possession or making unauthorised use of such property and fails to withdraw from such property or its possession or use, when called upon to do so by that another person by notice in writing duly served on him, is said to commit criminal trespass.  The aforesaid section consists of three parts. The ﬁrst two parts are same and similar to that of the original section of the IPC, 1860. The third part, with which the charge is concerned, says that if the person has lawfully entered into the premises and remains there with intention of (i) taking unauthorised possession or (ii) making unauthorised use of such property or (iii) fails to withdraw from such property or its possession or use when called upon to do so by notice in writing duly served on him, he is said to have committed the offence.671. The rigors of section 441, IPC, 1860 as amended by the Orissa Act, 22 of the 198 shall not be applicable to the following cases: (i) Statutory tenants whose tenancy is governed by any statute. (They are protected by tenancy laws like Public Premises Eviction Act, etc.)  (ii) Tenant who has entered into possession by virtue of a lease. (Rights of such tenant are governed under the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act and the Speciﬁc Relief Act and he acquires a right of possession. After determination of tenancy by notice, he would become \"Tenant holding over\"\"Tenant on sufferance\" or 'Tenant at will\" as the case may be. His possession being juridical, is protected. He can be evicted only in due process of law. The possession of such tenant cannot be equated with that of trespassers.)  (iii) Person who has entered into possession by virtue of some covenant like, agreement to sell, will etc. and/or put forth a genuine right over the property possessed.  (If a person claims a right of title coupled with possession, till the dispute is adjudicated, his possession cannot be conclusively said to be that of a trespasser and his right to possess would be subject to the result of the suit or legal proceeding.)672."

'Entering into'.—The introduction of any part of the trespasser's body is entering suﬃcient to constitute house-trespass.674. The roof being a part of a building, if any one goes on the roof of a building that will be tantamount to \"entering into\" the building within the meaning of that expression in this section.675. Section 441, IPC, 1860 would show that it is only when a person unlawfully remains in a property of another person \"with intent thereby to intimidate, insult or annoy any such person, or with intent to commit an offence\" that an offence of criminal trespass is committed. While there may be evidence in the present case that the accused/opposite party has unlawfully remained in the property belonging to the petitioner or that of the Mosque Committee to whom the petitioner is said to have donated the property, there is no evidence whatsoever that the accused/opposite party remained there with intent to intimidate, insult or annoy the petitioner or the Mosque Committee or with intent to commit an offence.676. 2. 'Building'.—What is a 'building' must always be a question of degree and circumstances; its ordinary and usual meaning is an enclosure of brick or stone work covered in by a roof.677. The mere surrounding of an open space of ground by a wall or fence of any kind cannot be deemed to convert the open space itself into a building, and trespass thereon does not amount to house-trespass.678. Even a structure with a   thatched roof, doors and shutters would come within the meaning of building if it is used as a human dwelling or place for the custody of property.679..",

Secondly.—If he enters or quits through any passage not intended by any person, other than himself or an abettor of the offence, for human entrance; or through any passage to which he has obtained access by scaling or climbing over any wall or building. Thirdly.—If he enters or quits through any passage which he or any abettor of the house-trespass has opened, in order to the committing of the house-trespass by any means by which that passage was not intended by the occupier of the house to be opened. Fourthly.—If he enters or quits by opening any lock in order to the committing of the house-trespass, or in order to the quitting of the house after a house-trespass. Fifthly.—If he effects his entrance or departure by using criminal force or committing an assault or by threatening any person with assault. Sixthly.—If he enters or quits by any passage which he knows to have been fastened against such entrance or departure, and to have been unfastened by himself or by an abettor of the house-trespass. Explanation.—Any out-house or building occupied with a house, and between which and such house there is an immediate internal communication, is part of the house within the meaning of this section. ILLUSTRATIONS (a) A commits house-trespass by making a hole through the wall of Z's house, and  putting his hand through the aperture. This is house-breaking.

(f) A ﬁnds the key of Z's housedoor, which Z had lost, and commits house-trespass  by entering Z's house, having opened the door with that key. This is housebreaking. (g) Z is standing in his doorway. A forces a passage by knocking Z down, and  commits house-trespass by entering the house. This is house-breaking. (h) Z, the door-keeper of Y, is standing in Y's doorway. A commits house-trespass by  entering the house, having deterred Z from opposing him by threatening to beat him. This is house-breaking.

Though the accused persons entered the shop lawfully they retained it unlawfully and dishonestly for more than 37 years. They were held to be guilty under this section read with section 34. The complainant died during the revision petition. The accused persons' conviction was maintained but they were released on probation and directed to restore the shop to the complainant's son.691. Allegation was that accused went to house of victim in order to commit offence of rape. Though rape was not committed at house of victim but committed at house of accused but entry of accused into house of victim was with intent to commit offence of rape. Accused is liable to be convicted under section 448 IPC, 1860.692.",

COMMENT— This section is similar to sections 449 and 450. It provides punishment for housetrespass committed with intent to commit an offence punishable with imprisonment. Where the accused was convicted of house-breaking, his object being to have sexual intercourse with the complainant's wife, it was held that the conviction was valid.703. The accused was held to be guilty of the offence under section 450 (lurking housetrespass where he entered the house at mid-night getting easy access because of acquaintance with the family and forcibly raped the victim girl ﬁnding her alone in her room. He was punished for rape and lurking house-trespass for committing an offence.704. Accused persons committed house trespass in order to commit an offence punishable with imprisonment. They went to the house of complainant with preparation by holding sticks in their hands for assaulting the complainant. Therefore, all the four accused are liable to be convicted under section 451 of the IPC, 1860.705. Where evidence shows that accused after entering the house unlawfully remained there and had even intimidated and insulted and annoyed the victim when they were called upon to quit the house. Court held that conduct of the accused will clearly come within the latter part of section 441 IPC, 1860 and the same will be punishable under section 451 IPC, 1860.706. There is enough material to show that the appellant had committed house trespass, however, not with intention to commit offence punishable with life imprisonment, hence, in such case section 451 IPC, 1860 would be attracted instead of section 450.707. The accused trespassed into the house of the victim girl who was nearly about ten years of age on the date of occurrence and committed unnatural offence on her. After ﬁnding the victim alone in the house the accused committed unnatural offence by putting his penis having carnal intercourse against order of nature. Order of acquittal is reversed by the Supreme Court.708. It was alleged that the accused trespassed into the house of the victim when she was all alone in order to commit rape. But there was no evidence of any preparation or attempt to rape. The conviction under section 452 was held to be not proper. Since the trespass was not for any pious purpose because an offence under section 354 (outraging modesty) was likely to be involved, conviction was recorded under section 451.709. In another case the Courts below observed that from the evidence of PWs 1   and 2 it is seen that theft had taken place in the room in which PW 2 was sleeping; the thief entered the house and committed theft of gold chain which PW 2 was wearing and, therefore, this act will be covered by section 451 of the IPC, 1860, i.e., housetrespass in order to commit offence punishable with imprisonment. A1 and A3 have been acquitted because nothing links them to the offence. But, similar is the case with the appellant. The only evidence against him is the alleged recovery of gold chain at his instance. That cannot connect the appellant to the offence.710. The accused was convicted for house trespass for committing unnatural offence. The accused was convicted by the trial court but acquitted by the High Court because of no corroboration of the testimony of the victim. The Supreme Court restored the conviction and observed that corroboration could not be required as a fossil formula, even if the story revealed by the victim appeals to the judicial mind as probable.711.",

COMMENT— The Legislature has enacted this section to provide higher punishment where housetrespass is committed in order to cause hurt, or to assault, or to wrongfully restrain any person.

COMMENT— Before holding a person to be guilty of offence under section 460, IPC, 1860, the prosecution must prove:— (i) that the accused committed lurking house trespass by night; or house breaking by night; (ii) that he caused, or attempted to cause, death or grievous hurt; (iii) that he did above whilst engaged in committing lurking house trespass by night or house breaking by night. On the aforesaid analysis of section, it is clear that this section applies to those persons who have actually committed lurking house trespass at night and not to those who may have accompanied their associates but did not commit the offence. Indeed, it applies to actual doers, and not the others.730. This section deals with the constructive liability of persons jointly concerned in committing 'lurking house-trespass' or 'house-breaking by night' in the course of which death or grievous hurt to any one is caused. It is immaterial who causes death or grievous hurt. Every person jointly concerned in committing such house-trespass or house-breaking shall be punished in the manner provided in the section. A person who actually commits murder in the course of committing house-breaking will attract the penalty under section 302.731. Every person who is jointly concerned in committing the offence of lurking house trespass by night or house breaking by night is to be punished with life imprisonment where death has been caused or with imprisonment which may extend to ten years where grievous hurt has been caused to any person. This joint liability is based upon the principle of constructive liability. Thus, the person who has actually committed the death or grievous hurt would be liable to be punished under the relevant provisions, i.e., section 302 or section 326, as the case may be, while committing the offence of lurking house trespass by night. It is possible that common intention or object be not the foundation of an offence under section 460 IPC, 1860. Thus, to establish an offence under section 460, it may not be necessary for the prosecution to establish common intention or object.

The principle of constructive liability is applicable in distinction to contributory liability. The Supreme Court in the case of Abdul Aziz v State of Rajasthan,732. clearly stated that if a person committing housebreaking by night also actually commits murder, he must attract the penalty for the latter offence under section 302 and the Court found it almost impossible to hold that he can escape the punishment provided for murder merely because the murder was committed by him while he was committing the offence of housebreaking and that he can only be dealt with under section 460.733. The words \"at the time of the committing of\" are limited to the time during which the criminal trespass continues which forms an element in house-trespass, which is itself essential to house-breaking, and cannot be extended so as to include any prior or subsequent time.734.

Section 467, IPC, 1860, does not require the prosecution to prove that the accused who commits forgery, has beneﬁtted thereby or any loss has occasioned to anyone thereby.48. There is a fundamental difference between a person executing a sale deed claiming that the property conveyed is his property, and a person executing a sale deed by impersonating the owner or falsely claiming to be authorised or empowered by the owner, to execute the deed on owner's behalf. When a person executes a document conveying a property describing it as his, there are two possibilities. The ﬁrst is that he has a bona ﬁde belief that the property actually belongs to him. The second is that he may be dishonestly or fraudulently claiming it to be his even though he knows that it is not his property. But to fall under ﬁrst category of \"false documents\", it is not suﬃcient that a document has been made or executed dishonestly or fraudulently. There is a further requirement that it should have been made with the intention of causing it to be believed that such document was made or executed by, or by the authority of a person, by whom or by whose authority he knows that it was not made or executed. When a document is executed by a person claiming a property which is not his, he is not claiming that he is someone else nor is he claiming that he is authorised by someone else. Therefore, execution of such document (purporting to convey some property of which he is not the owner) is not execution of a false document as deﬁned under section 464 of the Code. If what is executed is not a false document, there is no forgery. If there is no forgery, then neither section 467 nor section 471 of the Code is attracted.49.",

Precise details of all the ﬁctitious accounts as also the further ﬂow of money realized on encashment of demand drafts/pay orders have been incorporated in the charge sheet additionally, by allegedly claiming depreciation on the new machinery, which was never purchased, on the basis of forged invoices, etc.; the accused cheated the public exchequer as well. The Supreme Court held that proceedings are not liable to be quashed merely because dues of bank have been paid up.51. A deed of agreement for purchase of shares is not a valuable security.52. A person who received money from a postman under a false representation that he was the payee when in fact he was not, and signed the postal acknowledgement in the name of the payee, was held to have committed an offence under this section.53.

A bank draft is a security for the purposes of this section and the bank manager signing a forged draft is guilty of this offence.56.

The petitioner stood before the Court as surety in favour of   the accused person and ﬁled the aﬃdavit, bail declaration form and title document of the Land record-of-rights book before the Court. It was further revealed that the petitioner ﬁled the false declaration as well as false aﬃdavit in support of the said declaration. It was further found that both the documents, i.e., the declaration form as well the aﬃdavit of accused were prepared just before production of them in the Court. Admittedly, the offence was committed before the documents were ﬁled in the Court. Section 195(1)(b)(ii) of Cr PC would be attracted only when the offences enumerated in the said provision have been committed with respect to a document after it had been produced or given in evidence in a proceeding in any court, i.e., during the time when the document was in custodia legis. This being the settled position of law, there appears to be no justiﬁcation in quashing the prosecution of the petitioner-accused on the ground that provisions of section 195(1)(b)(ii) are applicable.59."

If the evidence on record indicate inducement of a belief in any manner in the woman which cannot possibly be enlisted but from which it can reasonably be inferred by ordinary prudence that she is a lawfully married wife of the man accused of an offence under section 493 IPC, 1860 the same will have to be treated as suﬃcient material to bring home the guilt under section 493 IPC, 1860.   Interpretation of the section in any other manner including an assertion that the marriage should have been performed by customary rituals or in similar manner only in order to establish that a belief of marriage had been induced, is bound to frustrate the very object and purpose of the provision for which it has been incorporated in the IPC, 1860 which is clearly to prevent the deceitful act of a man inducing the belief of a lawful marriage for the purpose of cohabitation merely to satisfy his lust for sexual pleasure.3. Where a man and woman exchanged garlands, the man promising to marry formally, and had sex as a result of which the woman became pregnant, it was held that the exchange of garlands did not amount to falsely inducing the woman to believe that she was married to the man. Section 493 was not attracted.4. Where a woman married a man with full knowledge that he was already a married man and there was no proof that the man falsely induced her to believe anything, it was held that the ingredients of the offence under section 493 were not made out.5."

        "section_comments": "In Joseph Shine v UOI,45. a Constitution bench of the Supreme Court decriminalised adultery and held section 497 of the IPC, 1860 unconstitutional as violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. Under section 397 a man who had sex with a married woman without getting her husband's permission could be charged and face punishment with imprisonment for a term up to ﬁve years, or with ﬁne, or with both, if convicted. Before, it was struck down, the cognizance of the offence was limited to adultery committed with a married woman, and the male offender alone was made liable to punishment. Thus, under the Code, adultery was an offence committed by a third person against a husband in respect of his wife. A married man was not liable if had sexual intercourse with an unmarried woman, or with a widow, or even with a married woman whose husband consented to it. Prior to the judgment in Joseph Shine case, the Supreme Court in Sowmithri Vishnu's case46. had upheld the constitutional validity of section 497, IPC, 1860. In Joseph Shine v UOI, AIR 2018 SC 4898 , the Supreme Court observed that: Adultery is different from an offence committed under Section 498-A or any violation of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 or, for that matter, the protection conceived of under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure or Sections 306 or 304B or 494 IPC. These offences are meant to sub-serve various other purposes relating to a matrimonial relationship and extinction of life of a married woman during subsistence of marriage. Treating adultery an offence would tantamount to the State entering into a real private realm. The act, i.e., adultery does not ﬁt into the concept of a crime. If it is treated as a crime, there would be immense intrusion into the extreme privacy of the matrimonial sphere. It is better to be left as a ground for divorce. For any other purpose as the Parliament has perceived or may, at any time, perceive, to treat it as a criminal offence will offend the two facets of Article 21 of the Constitution, namely, dignity of husband and wife, as the case may be, and the privacy attached to a relationship between the two.",

Therefore, in order to bring home guilt of a person under section 498, IPC, 1860, the prosecution has to prove that a married woman was enticed or taken away with an intention that she might have illicit intercourse with any person.47. Sections 361 and 366 may be compared with this section, which may come into operation when the two former sections fail to apply, but only in respect of a married woman. This and the preceding sections are evidently intended for the protection of husbands, who alone can institute prosecutions for offences under them.

ILLUSTRATIONS (a) A says—\"Z is an honest man; he never stole B's watch\"; intending to cause it to  be believed that Z did steal B's watch. This is defamation, unless it fall within one of the exceptions. (b) A is asked who stole B's watch. A points to Z, intending to cause it to be  believed that Z stole B's watch. This is defamation unless it falls within one of the exceptions. (c) A draws a picture of Z running away with B's watch, intending it to be believed  that Z stole B's watch. This is defamation, unless it fall within one of the exceptions. Imputation of truth which public good requires to be made or published.

Whether or not it is for the public good is a question of fact. Public conduct of public servants.

Publication of reports of proceedings of Courts. Fourth Exception.—It is not defamation to publish substantially true report of the proceedings of a Court of Justice, or of the result of any such proceedings. Explanation.—A Justice of the Peace or other oﬃcer holding an inquiry in open Court preliminary to a trial in a Court of Justice, is a Court within the meaning of the above section. Merits of a case decided in Court or conduct of witnesses and others concerned. Fifth Exception.—It is not defamation to express in good faith any opinion whatever respecting the merits of any case, civil or criminal, which has been decided by a Court of Justice, or respecting the conduct of any person as a party, witness or agent, in any such case, or respecting the character of such person, as far as his character appears in that conduct, and no further. ILLUSTRATIONS (a) A says—\"I think Z's evidence on that trial is so contradictory that he must be  stupid or dishonest\".

A is within the exception, if he says this in good faith, in as much as the opinion which he expresses of Z respects Z's character only so far as it appears in Z's book, and no further. (e) But if A says—\"I am not surprised that Z's book is foolish and indecent, for he is  a weak man and a libertine\". A is not within this exception, inasmuch as the opinion which he expresses of Z's character is an opinion not founded on Z's book. Censure passed in good faith by person having lawful authority over another. Seventh Exception.—It is not defamation in a person having over another any authority, either conferred by law or arising out of a lawful contract made with that other, to pass in good faith any censure on the conduct of that other in matters to which such lawful authority relates.

ILLUSTRATIONS (a) A, a shopkeeper, says to B, who manages his business—\"Sell nothing to Z unless  he pays you ready money, for I have no opinion of his honesty\". A is within the exception, if he has made this imputation on Z in good faith for the protection of his own interests. (b) A, a Magistrate, in making a report of his own superior oﬃcer, casts an  imputation on the character of Z. Here, if the imputation is made in good faith, and for the public good, A is within the exception. Caution intended for good of person to whom conveyed or for public good. Tenth Exception.—It is not defamation to convey a caution, in good faith, to one person against another, provided that such caution be intended for the good of the person to whom it is conveyed, or of some person in whom that person is interested, or for the public good.",

The term 'person' includes not only the physical body and members but also every bodily sense and personal attribute among which is the reputation a man has acquired. Reputation can also be deﬁned to be good name, the credit, honour or character which is derived from a favourable public opinion or esteem, and character by report. The right to enjoyment of a good reputation is a valuable privilege of ancient origin and necessary to human society. 'Reputation' is an element of personal security and is protected by Constitution equally with the right to enjoyment of life, liberty and property. Although, 'character' and 'reputation' are often used synonymously, these terms are distinguishable. 'Character' is what a man is and   'reputation' is what he is supposed to be in what people say he is. 'Character' depends on attributes possessed and 'reputation' on attributes which others believe one to possess. The former signiﬁes reality and the latter merely what is accepted to be reality at present.4."

The Court observed thus: One cannot be unmindful that right to freedom of speech and expression is a highly valued and cherished right but the Constitution conceives of reasonable restriction. In that context criminal defamation which is in existence in the form of ss. 499 and 500 Indian Penal Code is not a restriction on free speech that can be characterized as disproportionate. Right to free speech cannot mean that a citizen can defame the other. Protection of reputation is a fundamental right. It is also a human right. Cumulatively it serves the social interest.  The Apex Court did not accept that the provisions relating to criminal defamation are not saved by the doctrine of proportionality, because it determines a limit which is not impermissible within the criterion of reasonable restriction. The Court also held that the criminal prosecution on defamation will not negate and violate the right to speech and expression of opinion."

Imputations in a charge sheet which is sent to the employee himself does not amount to a publication.13. But where there is a duty which forms the ground of privileged occasion, the person exercising the privilege may communicate matters to a third person in the ordinary course of business. A solicitor who dictates to his clerk a letter containing defamatory statements regarding a person is not liable for defamation.14. Where the complainant's Advocate sent a notice to a party whose Advocate dictated a reply to his steno containing defamatory remarks and the same was sent to the complainant's Advocate, the Kerala High Court held that this did not amount to any publication.15. Communicating defamatory matter only to the person defamed is not publication.16. The action of a person who sent to a public oﬃcer by post, in a closed cover, a notice containing imputations on the character of the recipient but which was not communicated by the accused to any third person was held to be not such a 'making' or 'publishing' of the matter complained of as to constitute this offence.17. A notice under a Municipal Act was issued by the President of the Municipal Committee to a certain person, who sent a reply containing defamatory allegations against the President. This reply was put on the oﬃcial ﬁle by the President and it was read by the members of the Committee. It was held that there was publication of the defamation. The placing of the reply on the oﬃcial ﬁle was not a gratuitous or voluntary act on the part of the President but it was his duty to do so, and the accused knew or must have known that the contents of his reply would be necessarily communicated to the members of the Committee.18. Where the alleged defamatory words were sent to the complainant by registered post, it was held that there was no publication. There was absence of one of the necessary ingredients of the offence, namely publication. The complaint was liable to be quashed.19. Defamatory matter written on a postcard20. or printed on papers distributed or broadcast,21. constitutes publication. So is the ﬁling in a Court of a petition containing defamatory matter concerning a person with the intention that it should be read by other persons.22. When a person presents a defamatory petition to a superior public oﬃcer, who, in the ordinary course of oﬃcial routine, sends it to some subordinate oﬃcer for inquiry, there is a publication of the letter at the place where he may receive it, and publication for which the original writer may prima facie be held responsible, whether or not he expressly asks for an inquiry.23. Communication to a husband or wife of a charge against the wife or husband is publication,24. but uttering of a libel by a husband to his wife is not, as in England they are one in the eye of the law.25. Where a libel is printed, the sale of each copy is a distinct publication and a fresh offence; and conviction or acquittal on an indictment for publishing one copy will be no bar to an indictment for publishing another copy.26.   The person who publishes the imputation need not necessarily be the author of the imputation. The person who publishes and the person who makes an imputation are alike guilty.27."

It is for him to establish that the source on which he acted is a proper source on which he is entitled and he did with care and circumspection. Therefore, the editor and publisher are liable for the baseless and false matter which was published in the journal. Such an irresponsible conduct and attitude on the part of the editor and publisher cannot be said to be done in good faith.32.

The prosecution of the chairman and managing director of a company owning the newspaper for the publication of defamatory article in the newspaper by reason of their holding those posts would be invalid unless their personal involvement in the publication of the article is established.37. Where a newspaper carried extracts from a book written on one of the former Prime Ministers of India containing imputations of corruption, the editor of the newspaper was liable to be prosecuted. His plea that he was only a publisher and not the author of the extracts was held to be not tenable. It was alleged that there was a criminal conspiracy in the matter between the managing editor, resident editor and executing editor. All of them were liable to be prosecuted.38. A chief editor of a newspaper cannot say that he is not responsible for selection and publication of matters in the newspaper. A complaint against the chief editor is maintainable.39. The sending of a newspaper, containing defamatory matter by post from Calcutta, where it is published, addressed to a subscriber at Allahabad, is publication of such defamatory matter at Allahabad.40."

If the defamatory imputation is made available to public at several places, then the offence is committed at each such place.

Advocates as a class are incapable of being defamed.51. In this connection see comments under head \"Explanation-2\" infra.

The words complained of, to support a prosecution, must reﬂect on the management of its business and must injuriously affect the corporation, as distinct from the individuals who compose it. They must attack the corporation in its method of conducting its affairs, must accuse it of fraud or mismanagement or must attack its ﬁnancial position. A corporation cannot bring a prosecution for words which merely affect its honour or dignity.68. A prosecution lies for libelling Hindu widows as a class.69. Where the defamatory articles, published in a newspaper, related to the habitual immoral conduct of the girls of a particular college, but no particular girl or girls were named in or identiﬁable from the articles, and the complaint was ﬁled by a number of girls of the college, it was held that the author of the articles was guilty of defamation, in as much as the inevitable effect of the articles on the mind of the reader must be to make him believe that it was habitual with the girls of the college to misbehave in the ways mentioned so that all the girls in the college collectively and each girl individually must suffer in reputation.70.   This Explanation covers any collection of persons but such collection of persons must be identiﬁable in the sense that one could with certainty say that this group of particular people has been defamed as distinguished from the rest of the community. Public Prosecutors and Assistant Public Prosecutors at Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh were held to be an identiﬁable group and hence, could be the subject of defamation according to the Supreme Court.71. In this connection see para captioned \"Concerning any Person\" and the cases mentioned therein. The offending article must carry an imputation against a deﬁnite and ascertainable body of people. A complaint was not allowed to be continued where the article published in a magazine carried imputations against a certain community in general and not against any particular group, nor the community was found to be a deﬁnite and identiﬁable body of people and the imputations also did not relate to the complainant.72.

In order that a comment may be fair (a) it must be based on facts truly stated, (b) it must not impute corrupt or dishonourable motives to the person whose conduct or work is criticised except in so far as such imputations are warranted by the facts, (c) it must be the honest expression of the writer's real opinion made in good faith, and (d) it must be for the public good. The question to be considered in such cases is, would any fair man, however prejudiced he might be, or however exaggerated or obstinate his views may be, have made the criticism.87. Any opinion expressed in good faith made by a public servant would not amount to offence of defamation when public servant was acting in discharge of public functions. According to section 21 of the IPC, 1860, clause ﬁfth, a member of Panchayat assisting a Court of justice is within the scope of deﬁnition of \"public servant\". Hence, opinion expressed by member of Panchayat in good faith to assist Court of Justice does not amount to defamation.88. Those who ﬁll a public position must not be too thin skinned in reference to comments made upon them. Whoever ﬁlls a public position renders himself open to attack. He must accept an attack as a necessary, though unpleasant, appendage to his oﬃce.89. The law of defamation under the IPC, 1860 cannot be equated with that of contempt of Court in general terms.90.

            "sub_section_name": "Exception 9.—Good faith, individual interest or public good.—",
            "sub_section_description": "This Exception posits that the person to whom the communication is made has an interest in protecting the person making the accusation. Besides the bona ﬁdes of the person making the imputation, the person to whom the imputation is conveyed must have a common interest with the person making it which is served by the communication.117. The interest of the person referred to in this Exception has to be real and legitimate when communication is made in protection of the interest of the person making it. The privilege extends only to a communication upon the subject with respect to which the privilege extends and the privilege can be claimed in exercise of the right or safeguarding of the interest which creates the privilege.118. The regional   manager of a bank issued conﬁdential circular to branch managers of his region advising them to be vigilant while dealing with persons included in the list including the complainant. The circular was issued in his oﬃcial capacity in public interest and under instructions of the Central oﬃce. The Court said that the circular was covered by Exception 9. Therefore, even if the allegations made in the complaint were true, no offence would be made out under section 500.119. This exception relates to private communication which a person makes in good faith for the protection of his own interest. This exception covers not only such allegations of facts as can be proved true but also expression of opinions and personal inferences. It has been incorporated to protect the interests of the parties in their business transaction which are generally done bona ﬁde and, therefore, the rule of public good on which this principle is based is, that honest transaction of business and social intercourse would otherwise be deprived of the protection which they should enjoy. Whether any imputation made is with a motive or mala ﬁde intention to lower the reputation or is made in good faith is to be determined from the facts and circumstances of the case. Undisputedly, the requirement of good faith and public good, both, are to be satisﬁed and the failure to prove good faith would exclude the application of Exception 9 in favour of the accused even if the requirement of public good is satisﬁed. The words 'good faith' as appearing in exception 9th not only require logical infallibility but also due care and attention.120. This Exception refers to any imputation made in good faith, whereas the ﬁrst Exception applies only to true imputation made for the public good. That he acted in good faith must be proved by the accused.121. Question of good faith is a question of fact and has to be decided in course of the trial and at the initial stage. The journalists do not enjoy any special privilege.122. In determining the question of good faith, regard should be to the intellectual capacity of the accused, his predilections and the surrounding facts.123. Where a rustic villager objected to the appointment of the complainant as a village munsiff in the bona ﬁde belief that he was a rowdy and as such undesirable for a public post like this, it was held that he acted in good faith and was protected by this Exception.124. In order to establish good faith and bona ﬁdes it has to be seen ﬁrst the circumstances under which the defamatory matter was written or uttered; secondly, whether there was any malice; thirdly, whether the accused made any inquiry before he made the allegations; fourthly, whether there are reasons to accept the version that he acted with care and caution and ﬁnally whether there is preponderance of probability that the accused acted in good faith.125. The burden lies on the person accused to prove the bona ﬁde aspect of his publication. Cross-examination of the complainant can be used as a device for establishing goodfaith. An imputation was made in a newspaper item that the complainant lady doctor had duped the Government by presenting false transfer allowance bills. The lady doctor's sole testimony that the publication harmed her reputation was held to be not suﬃcient to sustain her complaint. The accused showed that the publication was in good faith and in public interest.126. Where the agreement for selling their properties for settling their dues was signed by the accused persons and registered before the Sub-Registrar in the presence of the accused but subsequently a publication in the newspaper was made by the accused after about two and a half months that the agreement was executed under compulsion, it was held that the publication was not made in 'good faith' and could not be brought under Exception 9 of section 499.127.   The ninth Exception to section 499 provides that it is not defamation to make an imputation on the character of another provided that the imputation be made in good faith for the protection of the interests of the person making it, or of any other person, or for the public good. Even if it is assumed that the accused No. 1 and other accused made the imputation against the respondent No. 1 that he had written the letters and thus, that imputation was made against his character, still that was made in good faith because they wanted protection of the interest of the members of the family of accused No. 1 and particularly his daughter. They did not approach any unconnected person, but police who could protect the interest of the accused No. 1 and his family members. In view of the legal position and the facts, which are clear from the complaint and the documents submitted with the complaint, it is clear that the case is clearly covered by Exceptions 8 and 9 and no case under section 500 IPC, 1860 could be made out.128."

A complaint for defamation by the person aggrieved by it can be entertained by a Court notwithstanding that the accused could have been prosecuted on the same facts under section 182 on the complaint of a public servant. The two offences are fundamentally distinct in nature, although they may arise out of one and the same statement of the accused. The defamatory statement does not fall within any of the Exception to section 499 by reason merely of the fact that it is punishable as an offence under section 182, or any other section of the Code; nor is this section included in the list of sections contained in section 195(1)(b) of the Cr PC, 1973.153. Where the imputations were against the managing director of a society, the society was held to be not an aggrieved person and, therefore, had no locus standi to ﬁle a complaint.154. A newspaper published extracts from books written on a former Prime Minister, imputing charges of corruption against him and also his family members including his sons, daughter and wife. It was held that his sons could be said to be aggrieved persons. A complaint ﬁled by one of the sons was not to be quashed.155. The continuation of the proceedings even after the death of the complainant has been held to be not proper.156. Where the allegation in the complaint was that the Kerala Police had been defamed, the Court said that Kerala Police was not a deﬁnite and determinable body and, therefore, a member of the Kerala Police was not a person affected by the defamatory statement and his complaint was not maintainable.157. When the statements in question are not directed against any person or against an identiﬁable group of individuals, the complainants cannot be said to be an aggrieved persons. The complainants have alleged defamation in respect of imputations against the character of Tamil-speaking women, which could be viewed as a class of persons. However, the appellant's remarks did not suggest that all women in Tamil Nadu have engaged in pre-marital sex.

These two provisions are totally distinct and can be tried in absence of each other.181."

If the insult is of such a nature that it may give provocation which might rouse a man to act either to break the public peace or to commit any other offence, the offence is committed.12. In judging whether a particular abusive language comes within the mischief of section 504, Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860), the Court has to see what would be the effect of the language used in ordinary course of events and not how the complainant actually behaved on being abused. Merely because a man of cool temperament did not react violently or break the peace it does not follow that no offence was committed by the accused.13. In the absence of actual words used by the accused or even a gist of it in the complaint it is not possible to say if the case falls within the ambit of section 504 (IPC, 1960), and as such the charge has to be quashed.14. Thus where the only allegation in the complaint was that when the complainant resisted the attempts by the accused to evict her forcibly from the land in her tenancy, the accused persons abused her in ﬁlthy words, the complainant not disclosing the actual words used by the accused or that she was provoked by the insulting abuse, the accused were not summoned.15.",

Section 511 Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860) is a general provision dealing with the attempts to commit offences and not made punishable by other speciﬁc section. It makes punishable all attempts to commit offences punishable with imprisonment and not only those punishable for life or death.3. A person commits the offence of 'attempt to commit a particular offence' when (i) he intends to commit that particular offence; and (ii) he, having made preparations and with the intention to commit the offence, does an act towards its commission; such an act need not be the penultimate act towards the commission of that offence, but must be an act during the course of committing that offence, section 511, IPC, 1860 is attracted.4. An attempt to commit an offence is an act, or a series of acts, which leads inevitably to the commission of the offence, unless something, which the doer of the   act neither foresaw nor intended, happens to prevent this. An attempt may be described to be an act done in part execution of a criminal design, amounting to more than mere preparation, but falling short of actual consummation, and, possessing, except for failure to consummate, all the elements of the substantive crime. In other words, an attempt consists in it the intent to commit a crime, falling short of, its actual commission or consummation/completion. It may consequently be deﬁned as that which if not prevented would have resulted in the full consummation of the act attempted. The illustrations given in section 511 clearly show the legislative intention to make a difference between the cases of a mere preparation and an attempt.5. In Om Prakash's case6. the Supreme Court has clearly held that like section 511, IPC, 1860 in section 307, IPC, 1860 to the act need not be the penultimate act.",

If the third stage, that is attempt is successful, then the crime is complete. If the attempt fails, the crime is not complete but the law punishes the person attempting the act. An 'attempt' is made punishable, because every attempt, although it fails of success, must create alarm, which, of itself, is an injury, and the moral guilt of the offender is the same as if he had succeeded. A culprit ﬁrst intends to commit the offence, then makes preparation for committing it and thereafter attempts to commit the offence. If the attempt succeeds, he has committed the offence, if it fails due to reasons beyond his control, he is said to have attempted to commit the offence. Attempt to commit an offence can be said to begin when the preparations are complete and the culprit commences to do something with the intention of committing the offence and which is a step towards the commission of the offence. The moment he commences to do an act with the necessary intention, he commences his attempt to commit the offence—the act need not be the penultimate act towards the commission of the offence but it must be an act during the course of committing that offence.7. (1) Intention.—Intention is the direction of conduct towards the object chosen upon considering the motives which suggest the choice.8. The will is not to be taken for the deed, unless there be some external act which shows that progress has been made in the direction of it, or towards maturing and affecting it. In an attempt to commit an offence, there must be intention to commit the crime combined with doing of some act adopted to, but falling short of its actual commission.9. (2) Preparation.—Preparation consists in devising or arranging the means or measures necessary for the commission of an offence.10."

It was held that she could not be convicted of an attempt to commit suicide as she might have changed her mind before jumping into the well.12. (3) Attempt.—Attempt is the direct movement towards the commission after the preparations are made.13. In State of Maharashtra v Mohd. Yakub,14. reported in the Apex Court considered the deﬁnition of 'attempt to commit crime' as the last proximate act which a person does towards the commission of an offence, the consummation of the offence being hindered by circumstances beyond his control. It was observed by the Apex Court that what constitutes an \"attempt\" is a mixed question of law and fact, depending largely on the circumstances of the particular case. \"Attempt\" deﬁes a precise and exact deﬁnition. Broadly speaking, all crimes which consist of the commission of aﬃrmative acts are preceded by some covert or overt conduct which may be divided into three stages. The ﬁrst stage exists when the culprit ﬁrst entertains the idea or intention to commit an offence. In the second stage, he makes preparations to commit it. The third stage is reached when the culprit takes deliberate overt steps to commit the offence. Such overt act or step in order to be 'criminal' need not be the penultimate act towards the commission of the offence. It is suﬃcient if such act or acts were deliberately done, and manifest a clear intention to commit the offence aimed, being reasonably proximate to the consummation of the offence. The test for determining whether the acts constitute attempt or preparation is whether the overt acts already done are such that if the offender changes his mind and does not proceed further in its progress, the acts already done would be completely harmless. But where the thing done is such as, if not prevented by any extraneous cause, would fructify into commission of an offence, it would amount to an attempt to commit that offence.15. An attempt to commit an offence does not cease to be an attempt merely because after the attempt is made and before the actual completion of the offence the offender may be able to prevent its completion by doing some other act in pursuance of a changed intention.16. An accused is liable for attempt where his failure to commit an offence is not due to any act or omission of his own, but to the intervention of some factor independent of his own volition.17. Where misrepresentations had been made and money obtained from the persons sought to be cheated by misrepresentations, there is an attempt to cheat and not merely a preparation for committing that offence.18."

A person commits the offence of attempt to commit a particular offence when accused (i) intends to commit a particular offence, (ii) he having made preparation and with the intention to commit an offence, (iii) does an act towards its commission, such an act need not be the penultimate act towards the commission of that offence but must be an act during the course of committing that offence.19."

            "sub_section_description": "An attempt is possible, even when the offence attempted cannot be committed; as when a person, intending to pick another person's pocket, thrusts his hand into the pocket, but ﬁnds it empty. That such an act would amount to a criminal attempt appears from the illustrations to this section. But in doing such an act, the offender's intention is to commit a complete offence, and his act only falls short of the offence by reason of an accidental circumstance which has prevented the completion of the offence. It is possible to attempt to commit an impossible theft and so offend against the Code because theft is itself an offence against the Code, and may therefore, be attempted within the meaning of the Code. At the same time it is necessary to show that the means adopted are apparently suitable for the fulﬁlment of the design.22. Thus where a man threatens the life of another with a child's pop gun using a cork as a projectile23. or tries to pick the pocket of a man who is well beyond the reach of his hand, no attempt either to commit murder or to steal can be said to have been committed as the means adopted are impossible of achieving the designed purpose. Similar would be the case in regard to absolutely impossible acts. Thus where the act is such that it is incapable of commission, e.g., trying to steal from an empty room or an empty pocket or trying to kill a person by shooting at a bulge in a bed thinking it to be the enemy, no criminal attempt can be said to have been committed.24. In the IPC, 1860, however, trying to steal from an empty pocket would still constitute an attempt as Illustration (b) to section 511, IPC, 1860 speciﬁcally says so. Though in England too this happened to be the law previously25. the position has materially changed after the decision of the House of Lords in Haughtons case.26. It is felt that the law in India should be changed on this score at least to bring about a uniformity of approach to this question of attempt so far sections 307 and 511, IPC, 1860 are concerned especially, after the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Om Prakash's case,27. has held that under both these sections the act need not be the last proximate act."

In support of his application, he attached certain certiﬁcates purporting to be from the Headmaster of the School and the Inspector of Schools. The University authorities gave the accused permission to appear at the examination. Later on, ﬁnding that the certiﬁcates were false and that the accused was not a graduate and was not a teacher, the University authorities withdrew the permission. The Supreme Court held that the accused was guilty of attempting to cheat and that the moment the accused dispatched his application to the University, he entered the realm of attempting to commit the offence of cheating.28. Where the accused made an alteration in his own aﬃdavit under the honest belief that it was necessary for customs' clearance, the Supreme Court set aside the conviction under section 420 read with this section.29. The offence of attempting to cheat may be committed even though the person attempted to be cheated does not believe in the representations made to him and is not misled by them but only feigns belief in order to trap the offender.30."

The dividing line between attempt to commit rape and indecent assault is not only thin but also is practically invisible. For an offence of attempt to commit rape, prosecution is required to establish that the act of the accused went beyond the stage of preparation. In a given case, where the prosecutrix was made naked and her cries attracted her uncle who came to the spot and then the accused ﬂed away, it was held that it was not a case of attempt to commit rape but was one under section 354 of IPC, 1860.31."
