{"query": "I am thinking about setting up a public trust in Maharashtra based on Maharashtra Public Trust Act by contributing my agricultural land as a corpus fund of the trust. Here is my idea: I will act as a settlor without any rights in the management of the trust, my two friends (all of them are agriculturists) will become trustees and they will utilize the land, and the general public in the community will become beneficiaries. The purpose of the trust will be to promote people's welfare through charitable/social/educational/religious activities. After settig up the trust, I plan to transfer the land to the trust on practical base (7/12 ownership change, mutation entry) at an appropriate timing.
