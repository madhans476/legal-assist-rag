The fact is that even after filing for divorce either of the spouse has the option to back out of the agreement.\n2) You can of course file for divorce in your place independently citing cruelty which is a common factor applicable in the current instance.The fact that the wife has refused to live with you is act of cruelty.\n3) Despite the fact that you have returned all the jewelry and whatever had been given during the wedding, your wife can as a counter strategy move a petition against you under provisions of Protection of Women against Domestic Violence Act 2005 or dowry harassment under section 498A of IPC. \n4) If the above happens you may have to take anticipatory Bail to avoid getting arrested.

        "query-text": "Hello experts\r\nI am asking this i n regards with my sister's unsuccessful marriage. My younger sister has been married for six years now and behaviour of her husband towards her has been remained unrespectfull. Before her marriage in 2010 she was employed with the state government job on adhoc basis and had solid chance of getting a permanent job but after marriage her husband forced her and totured her mentally to leave her job and sit at home. He, since starting had been putting questions on her character and even stopping her to take kids for a walk in colony or by standing on the terrace/balcony of their residence. She has been suffering this mental torture right from starting her marriage. Her husband even once beat his 4 years old daughter for talking to a BOY of her class after school time, questioning his own 4 years old daughter's character. He even sold all gold of my sister on the basis to help his brothers' family. He continued to stop her from working anywhere and from letting her become financially self dependent. Situation is now that my sister has an opportunity of a respected government job but her husband is still prohibiting her from taking the opportunity. When she expressed her desire he asked her to get out of his home with the kids and never to return. When he first did it three months back , i thought about giving that person a second chance and took my sister and her kids back to her husband's home. But now he has done same once again and this time my sister has compltely refused to stay with that man and wants to move out of this marriage legally . She also wants to teach him a lesson as he has ruined her whole life. My sister and her kids are staying with me at my home for last one month now. 4 days ago someone rang my door bell and said from outside the gate , \"sir, it is ur luggage\", and ran away. This happened at 12 AM. I went out and found that there were 4 bags lying on my gate's ramp. I did nt take the bags inside my home and with a thought of looking into the matter the following morning, i went to sleep. After that two police constables who were on night duty saw the bags outside my gate and rang my doorbell at 3AM. When i went out and explained them the whole situation, they searched the bags and thus we came to know that it was my sister and her kid's luggage, whixh was put there by her husband. It also contained a letter by her husband to my sister. Now i really am helpless. I have no idea how to get my sister out of this marriage and let her make her two daughters' future secure. Hopefully she will get her government job in two to three months. Please guide me.\r\nThanks and regards\r\nKuldeep bhatt",

In other words, unless there is a complete agreement between husband and wife for the dissolution of the marriage and unless the court is completely satisfied, it cannot grant a decree for divorce by mutual consent.\nThe Conditions required under section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act are as follows:\n(i)\tHusband and wife have been living separately for a period of one year or more,\n(ii)\tThat they are unable to live together,\n(iii)\t And that both husband and wife have mutually agreed that the marriage has totally collapsed, hence marriage should be dissolved\nThere are two court appearances in a mutual divorce. First a joint petition signed by both parties is filed in court. At the first motion statement of both parties are recorded and then signed on paper before the Honourable Court. Then 6 month period is given for reconciliation, and called after six months. After the first motion or at the end of the reconciliation period if both parties still don't agree to come together. Then the parties may appear for the second motion for the final hearing. So in your case better to ensure that she is present in the court in second motion time."

The same we don't have it as 1 partner has not signed it.\r\nThe same partner has also filed a suit against remaining partners for making changes in the old deed.\r\n\r\nSo can we open a fresh current account with different bank and submit a fresh partnership deed of 7 partners instead of 8 partners on temporary basis????\r\n\r\nWe can show in court but making some affidavit that such temporary provision is done to facilitate the ongoing business till the dispute is resolved. \r\n\r\nBecause taking money directly in personal account and paying GST through different account is very difficult and there is a desperate need to open a current account.\r\n\r\nPls guide",

        "query-text": "Please help me on following query - I am general category person\r\n\r\n1. In 2014, I made a complaint against my neighbour belonging to SC category since he was continuously damaging my property. My neighbour within 2 days made a false complaint against my family members under SC ST Act. He also got 2 witnesses to substantiate his lies.\r\n\r\n2. Back then I was forced to take my complain back since the complaint under SC ST Act was more grave. Also I was forced to break my boundry wall as a result of the blackmail. Subsequently, my neighbour also wrote in the compromise letter that he made the caste based allegation under anger.\r\n\r\n3. Last month, my neighbour again started damaging my property. Therefore I made a complaint to Superintendent of Police. I also requested that he is threatening to level false complaint against me and my family members. He was also made to sign a bond of 5000 Rs to maintain peace in the SDM court.\r\n\r\n4. Again this time after I made a complaint against my neighbour, he made a false complaint against me and all my family members under SC ST Act. Therefore an FIR is registered against my family members and myself under SC ST Act. It is under investigation by DSP.\r\n\r\nMy following queries.\r\n\r\n1. Whether DSP will consider the past records in which I have made complaints against my neighbour for damaging my property?\r\n\r\n2. Whether DSP will consider that my neighbour is using SC ST Act, as a tool to blackmail me and escaping criminal liability?\r\n\r\n3. Whether the fact that my neighbour in writing has previously confirmed that he made a false complaint undder SC ST Act out of anger is relevant? This was written as a part of compromise.\r\n\r\n4. How should I come outside this vicious clutches of SC ST Atrocity Act?\r\n\r\n5. Can my neighbour keep on using this act after every few years to get his work done against me?",

For secondary evidence, the testimony must indicate that the alleged photocopy was prepared from the original or that it was not prepared from a copy of the original, or that it was compared with (he original if prepared from a copy compared with the original. In the absence of any material, it cannot be treated to be a secondary evidence. It is only orally being claimed to be a photocopy without claiming that what was photographed was the original or that it was compared with the original. So, the photocopy to be admissible as evidence has to be a certified copy. No reliance can be expected on a document which is otherwise inadmissible in a Court and. that whenever \"document\" is referred in an order or is required to be produced, it must satisfy the test of admissible documents viz. original or secondary as provided in Sections 64, 65 and 66 of the Evidence Act.

Builder are expected to follow through with this, because of the anti-profiteering provision in Section 171 of the GST Act. The objective of anti-profiteering is to ensure that the benefits derived under GST, if any, should be passed on to the end user. Homebuyers however remain doubtful, even as the government is doing everything possible to ensure that builders pass on ITC on construction materials and services available under GST to homebuyers, with the hope to make housing more affordable. \nThe Government to ensure that businesses do pass on the entire benefit of lower tax incidence, including ITC to the consumers, has set up a five-member Anti-Profiteering Authority for GST. The authority, to be headed by a retired secretary-level officer, can take suo motu action, besides acting on complaints of profiteering. The authority will operate for two years before any changes and will decide on the various penalties to be levied. The primary duty of the authority would be to make businesses refund the price reduction on a proportionate basis to consumers."

According to the agreement there was no clause about extra service tax on property price.

Is GST applicable on this property as I booked it before 1st July 2017?\r\n2. If GST is applicable, then will it be applicable on the amount which I have already paid to the Builder before 1st July?\r\n3.  12% or 8%  GST will applicable for My Flat as because I belong to lower income group (LIG) and Carpet area of my booked flat is under 60sq.mt.

Earlier, this attracted service tax. Now GST has replaced service tax in these transactions.\nIn its 25th GST council meeting, it has been decided to extend the benefits to houses constructed or acquired under the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS); lower-income group (LIG), middle income group-1 (MlG-1) and middle income group-2 (MlG-2) under the Housing for All (Urban) Mission or Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) and low-cost houses up to a carpet area of 60 square metres per house in a housing project that has been given infrastructure status, as proposed by Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.\nThe new GST rate on these houses would be 12%, with one-third abutment for land cost; resulting in an effective rate of 8%.\n4. Now GST has replaced service tax in these transactions. However, there are other goods and services that continue to attract taxes in addition to the GST. \nAfter buying a property, the buyer has to register it by paying stamp duty and registration fee\u2014which are in addition to the GST. Stamp duty is levied by respective state governments and usually varies between 5% and 8% across the country. This means that GST and these other fees constitute about 20% of a property\u2019s value. \n5. You can make a complaint with RERA or can drag him to consumer court also."

I don't belong to an agricultural family, but the other two belong to the agricultural family. As a result, I can't have my name on the agricultural land. So, the plan is to buy the agricultural land in either of their names and when we convert it into commercial land, they can add my name. Even though I trust them, I would be much more comfortable if there is a way to get into legal binding here. Also, please note I am an NRI with annual income over 25L and all the earnings are from outside India. Please let me know if its possible. \r\n\r\n2. How long does it usually take to convert the land from agricultural to commercial?( i know its case by case basis, but just wondering what is the rough estimate) \r\n\r\n3. I would also like to know if there are any circumstances where an agricultural land cannot be converted in commercial( so I can check the land doesn't have any of these blockers)\r\n\r\n4. Is it possible that we create a company and buy the land in the name of the company, and three of us will be equal shareholders in that company?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nVishal",

You or your family members must be an agriculturist as on date\n2. You or your family members income shall not exceed more than 25 Lakh from the other than agricultural sources. \nAs you said, if others two are belongs to agricultural family by satisfying the aforesaid two requirements that they may buy the land. Further, your name can be include as owner once the land converted from agricultural to non agricultural i.e, Commercial purpose by following legal procedures. \nB. Once the required documents submitted before the Revenue Department which means Deputy Commissioner office that land documents would be scrutinized by the DC as to whether the land was granted or not? if granted, was there any perpetual non alienation clause or not? What is the nature of land? and all the documents will be verified as per their parameters.\nHence, it may take odd time depends upon nature of land and work load in DC office and how you involved in the conversion procedure through your network to complete all these task. According to sources, bribe also one of important matter in this procedures. Apart from these, 90 days is general period. \nC. In addition to the above clause, as far as the conversion for Commercial purpose is concerned that depends upon CDP/ODP plan is very crucial to verify as to whether the land is coming under the agricultural zone or commercial zone or Industrial zone or sensitive zone? if the land is coming under the agricultural zone is very difficult and impossible to convert the same and if the land is coming under the residential or industrial zone that land need to get the change of land use order first and later you can convert the same. Hence, you need to verify the land zone and Deputy Commissioner will verify as to whether the land belongs to any notification towards the Road proposal or any road widening or any acquisition proposal or not ? Therefore, so many things needs to be verified. \nD. You can create the Company or Partnership Firm or Limited Liability Partnership Firm, but the Company cannot buy an agricultural land unless converted the same from agricultural to non agricultural purpose. Hence, the Company or Firm can buy the land after the Conversion. However, the Company can buy agricultural land for educational institution or to achieve religious objectives by obtaining permission under Section 109 of the Karnataka Land Revenue Act, 1964."

Fathers Will was not probated. The flat still stands in my fathers name.\r\nMy brother passed away in 2017, leaving behind his estranged widow and a small shop, with no Will. The shop is in the name of the partners (brother and wife). Value of flat is 4 x value of shop.\r\n\r\nThe family has come to an agreement whereby the flat will be transferred to my name, the shop to my 4 sisters name, and I put up approx 100 lacs as owelty as my sister-in-law\u2019s share of the estate. The money left in the the bank by my brother is sufficient to pay off taxes on shop, the estate settlement charges and a small bequest to his employees and maid. Ideally if a family settlement document included the shop, then the stamp duty would need to be paid on the smallest portioned shares, which is the shop. However, since the shop was individually acquired and hence Is not a joint property, I don\u2019t think we can include it in the family settlement. Is that correct? If correct, then if we had a series of family settlement documents, and one document only specified that the house would be transferred to me, and since there is no partition, what would be the stamp duty, if any. If I also included in the document the payment I was putting into the pot towards the family settlement, what would be the duty? Would that amount be included in my cost basis. Once the family settlement document is executed, do I still need to execute another instrument such as a gift or sales deed to transfer the flat in my name? I would prefer that the a out pad to my sister-in-law.be tax free as it is a family settlement which normally is out of the purview of the tax department.\r\n\r\nCan you please recommend an overall strategy other than probating my father\u2019s Will.",

                "response-text": "Dear Sir,\nIn India, the distribution and inheritance of a person's property is governed by the Indian Succession Act, 1925. The Indian Succession Act defines a \u201cWill\u201d as the \"legal declaration of the intention of a testator with respect to his property which he desires to be carried into effect after his death\". In other words, it is a legal instrument specifying the method to be applied in the management and distribution of a person's estate after his death. Upon the death of the testator, a property is transferred/ devolves in favor of his/her beneficiaries as per the terms of the will.\u00a0There are certain legal instruments specified in the Registration Act, 1908, which require compulsory registration with competent authorities. Registering instruments that require compulsory registration as per this Act qualifies them as being valid instruments that are admissible in evidence in courts. Wills do not require compulsory registration per se under the Registration Act, 1908. Thus, even an unregistered will that has been properly executed is a valid instrument in the eyes of law.\u00a0The Delhi Municipal Act stipulates that in the event of the death of a person who is primarily liable for payment of property taxes as mentioned above, the beneficiary on whom a property devolves is required to notify the MCD about such devolution within a period of six months from the death. When giving such written notification, the beneficiary is required to produce documents proving devolution of the property in his favor. As evidence, a beneficiary can furnish the will either registered or unregistered as evidence of a lawful transfer of the property in his favor.\u00a0\u00a0However, as per a recent Circular released by the Government of Delhi, state officials have been directed to ensure that a beneficiary under an unregistered Will, now, mandatory obtains and submits a succession certificate/probate order to the MCD, in order to get the property mutated in his favor as well as for updating property records. On the other hand, a beneficiary furnishing a registered will is not required to additionally provide a succession certificate/ probate order. For the purpose of better understanding a `Probate Order' herein means \u00a0copy of a Will certified by Court of competent jurisdiction, which is to be treated as a direct evidence of the authenticity of a will thereby granting administration to the asset.\u00a0Hence in view of aforesaid, if your Will is unregistered, under such circumstances you will have to file an application under Section 276(1) of Indian Succession Act 1925 for seeking Probate orders. Section 276(1) of Indian Succession Act is reproduced here under for your better understanding:\u00a01. Application for probate or for letters of administration, with the Will annexed, shall be made by a petition distinctly written in English or in the language in ordinary use in proceedings before the Court in which the application is made, with the Will or, in the cases mentioned in sections 237, 238 and 239, a copy, draft, or statement of the contents thereof, annexed, and stating\u2014\u00a0a. the time of the testator\u2019s death,\u00a0b.\u00a0that the writing annexed is his last Will and testament,\u00a0c.\u00a0that it was duly executed,\u00a0d.\u00a0the amount of assets which are likely to come to the petitioner\u2019s hands, and\u00a0e.\u00a0when the application is for probate, that the petitioner is the executor named in the Will.\u00a0With respect to your second query, under Limitation Act no period of limitation is specifically prescribed for filing a probate application. Therefore, you can file a probate application without any charges, in case of delay. Even otherwise, if period of limitation was prescribed, even then also, you were not required to pay any extra charges. You were just required to file an application of condonation of delay, therein justifying the period of delay.\u00a0In reply to your third and fourth query, it is stated that, yes there is a Circular released by the Government of Delhi, wherein all beneficiary under an unregistered Will is now required to obtain and submit a succession certificate/probate order to the MCD, in order to get the property mutated in his favor as well as for updating property records. For the forgoing reasons, it is advisable to get the Will registered in order to ensure that the beneficiary gets the complete and legal inheritances of the property after the death of the Testator.\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, the procedure of filing a probate application is \u00a0stated as under:\u00a0The application for a probate under Section 276(1) has to be made to the competent court (a pecuniary jurisdiction may require a higher court to issue a probate for high-value immovable assets) through a lawyer.\u00a0The application must contain the time of the testator's death; a copy of the last will; and the amount, title deeds and documents pertaining to the assets in question.\u00a0After receiving the application, the court issues a notice to the relatives of the testator to file their objections (if any), for the granting of probate of a will. A general public notice is also given in a newspaper.\u00a0If there are no objections raised and/or if the Court is satisfied that the Will in question has been validly executed, it will grant probate of a will only to the executor named in the Will.\u00a0The grant of probate of a will may be cancelled by the District Judges in the respective district, if:\u00a0a.\u00a0the proceedings to obtain the grant were flawed; or\u00a0b.\u00a0if the grant was obtained by fraud, ignorantly alleging an essential, or by making false suggestions; or\u00a0c.\u00a0if the person to whom the grant was made willfully and without reasonable cause, omitted to exhibit an inventory of account\u00a0required by law; or\u00a0d.\u00a0exhibited inventory of account.\u00a0Usually, if no objections are raised, Probate can be granted within 6 to 9 months, but if objections are raised, then no time limit can be prescribed for same.\u00a0Furthermore, with respect to expenses, you would be required to pay a Court fees as mentioned in Section 19 -1 of Court Fees Act which is approximately 2% to 3% on the value of the property. Along with the court fee, you would required to pay the fee of lawyer which may depend upon the facts of your case."

Three daughters have put the witness signature on the sale deed while registering to Mr. Suresh. \r\nI have received the Notices in 2008 from Mr. Sukumar second wife claiming she has a share on the property as the property is ancestor in nature. Mr. Sukumar have two daughters from his first marriage and one son from second marriage. The lower court gave the judgement to divide the property into 4 equal shares (equal shares to Mr. Sukumar and 3 daughters). From sukmars share of 1/4th, 4 equal parts to 1 to sukamr and 2 to 2 of his daughters from first marriage and 4th part to son from his second marriage. In essence 1/16th share to second marriage son. Now my question is I have purchased this property on my hard earned money and was not aware of all these family disputes. Please advise how to ensure my property is not partitioned. Mr sukamar clearly agreed in the registered sale deed that he will responsibility for any losses. How to fight my case in Legal courts?? Does the sisters have share even now even though they have put the witness signatures on the sale deed.",

The D.V. Act has been enacted to provide a remedy in Civil Law for protection of women from being victims of domestic violence and to prevent occurrence of domestic violence in the society.\nThe Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 is essentially a civil law, but the legislation has prescribed that courts have to proceed in such cases as per the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) for the purpose of effective actions. \nIPC 498a was made to protect a woman from injury to life or limb, or mental harassment to the extent to drive her to suicide. All problems in marital life do not attract 498a, to the extent made clear in this SC judgment too. 498A IPC is a pure criminal offence in which punishment is awarded to the offenders. 498A is a criminal offence that came into existence to combat domestic violence and protect women from dowry harassment\nSection 498A IPC therefore, provided women with the only means for such protection prior to this Act. But the reluctance of women to approach the criminal justice system and the inadequacy of the criminal remedy itself are important realities of our social context.\nIn your case the notice was send from the court and counsel for respondents appeared before the court in CV case. If it is a case under 498A, the respondent (accused) bound to take bail. That is the difference here. At the time of giving evidence their presence is important other wise they become called exparty and order passed by the court if you will adduce ample evidence according to your case.

Interestingly, GPA is revocable or can even be terminated at any time unless made irrevocable in a manner known to law.\nGPA is Not Irrevocable\nThe law is that even if the parties have determined that the GPA is irrevocable it won\u2019t have the effect of transferring title to the grantee. Thus, in totality GPA does not convey ownership of the buyer; however, a GPA holder may execute a deed of conveyance in exercise of the power granted under the power of attorney and convey title on behalf of the grantor.\nTaking the judgment from the Supreme of India into consideration it\u2019s a settled law now that immovable property can be legally and lawfully transferred or conveyed only by a registered deed of conveyance and not through GPA. Thus, as GPA does not conclude complete transaction, the Supreme Court parties should consider registering the deed of conveyance.\nThe Supreme Court in the case had however, observed that GPA transactions may also be used to obtain specific performance or to defend possession under section 53A of Transfer of Property Act, 1882."

It is also against article 51 A (g) of the Indian Constitution wherein, it is the duty of every citizen to have compassion towards animals, living creatures and improve the natural environment.\nOwners should avoid their pets being teased by children and others. This angers the animal causing untoward instances for no fault of the animal.\nThe dog owner must make sure that their pet is not causing any nuisance in the neighbourhood.\nResidents keeping domestic animals or other pets shall abide by the Municipal Sanitary Bye-Laws or Regulations.\nEnsure that certain strict rules and regulations are followed so that no one is inconvenienced or affected\nEven on walks within the premises or in any other common area, the animal has to be on a leash and accompanied by the owner at all times.\nIt makes sense to go through the rules of residential complexes before renting a flat.\nIn an apartment block, you have scores of people walking in and out, from maids to milkman to children. It is essential to train the dogs so that they don\u2019t get provoked on seeing neighbours and workers.\nEnsure that your pet does not become a nuisance to others\nIt needs to be toilet trained and taught some amount of discipline.\nEnsure that your pet does not cause inconvenience for others.\nEnsure that your pet does not fight with others pets.\nBy Laws With Respect to Street Dogs:\nBeating and driving away street dogs is not allowed.\nCapturing street dogs for birth control or other medication related measures is allowed but they must be released back into the same locality.\nThere is now law barring any Indian resident to feed stray dogs. Feeding is equated as a compassionate feeling and is highly supported by the higher courts.\nBeating street dogs comes under the animal cruelty at as is a punishable offence under Section 428 and 429 of the Indian penal code.\nHostility or aggressive behavior that may lead pets to embrace an aggressive behavior is not allowed"

When wife asks for divorce husband has to accept it and put an end to marriage by way of an agreement called Khula.\nMubarat: When husband and wife mutually consent to divorce each other it is known as mubarat. The offer to divorce can be made by either husband or wife\nMUBARAT [319(3)] In Mubarat both the parties are equally willing to dissolve the marriage. Therefore, in Mubarat the offer for separation may come from either the husband or the wife to be accepted by the other. So who takes the initiative is irrelevant here. One of the important features is that here both the parties are equally interested in the dissolution of marriage so no party is legally bound to compensate the other by giving some consideration. Same conditions as Khula also apply in Mubarat.

Dr. Trimbak Bapu Godbole\u00a0had observed that every doctor must exercise reasonable \u201cstandard of care\u201d that are set out in the profession. Any breach towards these duties shall hold him liable for medical negligence.\nA medical professional or hospital shall be held liable for all actions against the patients where they have not taken proper standard of care and it has resulted in suffering on part of the patient. The burden of proof shall lie on the complainant to prove a case of negligence. They have to first establish that there was a duty of care on part of the accused and that, there was breach of such duty.\nThe State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission of Jharkhand in\u00a0Jagdish Prasad Singh v. Dr. A.K.Chatterjee\u00a0directed the opposite party to pay a sum of Rs. 25,000 to the complainant as compensation for his mental agony and physical harassment and Rs. 5,000 as litigation cost. It was observed that the accused had failed to take due care to return the precise findings in the reports. Whether harm came to the patient or not would not be the criteria for case against negligence.\nThus you have relief before the consumer forum and not by filing a PIL.\nYou may discuss with a local advocate and proceed as suggested."

It implies that the working of a partnership firm is stopped and the assets are realised to pay the various kind of liabilities. However, there is a demarcation between the dissolution of a partnership firm and the dissolution of partnership. Dissolution of partnerships refers to the termination of the partnership relationship of one partner with other partners and the firm whereas the dissolution of partnership means the end of the partnership business. If an existing partner dies, retires or is unable to pay the debt then other partners can purchase the share of the outgoing partner and continue the business under the same name.\nHowever, dissolution of partnership firm is triggered when some predefined conditions as per the Partnership Act of 1932 are met such as:\n Dissolution by Agreement\n Dissolution by Notice\n Dissolution by the Court\n Compulsory Dissolution\n Conditional Dissolution \nGive legal notice to your partner to make an dissolution agreement and divide asset and liability.\nif he reply or divide doesn't file a suit in civil court for dissolution of the firm."

Any partner may, with the consent of all the other partners or in terms of the deed of Partnership where the Partnership is at will, by giving notice in writing to all other partners, to that effect, dissolve the Partnership or retire from Partnership. A retiring partner, however, continues to be liable to third parties even if the liability is taken over by the remaining partners (S 32). Therefore in a deed of retirement it is necessary to provide that in the event of the retiring partner being held liable by a third party, the remaining partners shall indemnify him to that extent, when the liabilities are taken over by the remaining partners. Insolvency of a partner also causes compulsory retirement of an insolvent partner (S. 35). It is, therefore, generally provided in a deed of Partnership when there are more than two partners that the insolvency of any partner will not dissolve the Partnership. If a partner retires, unless there is contract to the contrary, the retiring partner cannot use the firm name, represent himself as carrying on the business of the firm or solicit the customers of the Firm (S. 36). Therefore, in a deed of retirement it is generally not necessary to make explicit that the retiring partner shall not do any of these things. But, if he is to be restrained from carrying on similar business for a specified period or in a specified area, such condition can be provided in the deed of retirement and it is legal (S 36 (2). \nTake a resignation letter from such partner and submit the same with bank with a letter of change in authorised signatories of such partnership firm account. \n Partner ship firm means working with an other person, so you need to have partner after his resignation. You just take a resignation letter on plain paper. \n \nTerms to negotiate with your Partner(s), that should find their way into the Separation Agreement include:\nFinal disposition of assets and liabilities\nThe price the Company is paying for your ownership, and how it\u2019s paid (if some form of payment terms apply)\nHow the Company will remove your name over time from any obligatory documents"

Then you have another chance to approach High Court to challenge such order.\nIf you filing quashing petition after charge sheet then High Court may ask to exhaust the remedy of discharge before the Trial Court.\nSo first option is better option.\n=========================================================\nContents in an Application For Discharge under Section 239 C.R.P.C\nThe following points must be raised in the Application:\nDepending upon the nature of the offence, it has to be asserted That no material particulars of the offence have been specified in the F.I.R and Charge sheet i.e Vagueness in allegations in F.I.R and Charge sheet.That the F.I.R and Charge sheet allegations have not been supported by evidence.That the version of the Prosecution has not been supported by any of the witnesses for the Prosecution Contradictions present in the versions of the Prosecution and Witnesses.That the allegations in the charge sheet are new and different from complaint allegations and these new allegations were not communicated to the accused to defend by the accused by producing supporting evidence.\nConclusion\nA question may crop up as to what exactly constitutes a prima-facie case. The Courts have reiterated that there must no be a single shred of evidence against the Accused. However the Courts have also held that in the event a suspicion arises against the Accused, still he would be discharged provided the suspicion is not a grave suspicion. \nIn the words of the Honble Kerala High Court The law does contemplate a situation, though it must be rare, where an indictment on the basis of a final report may be groundless. \nIn such circumstances, the court provides the safety valve provision in Section 239/240 C.r.P.C where under premature discharge can be claimed by such indictees."

Person A had 4 brothers who were all majors 20+ who had not signed the documents.\r\n1999- Person X has sold the above said land through \"Sale deed\" to a well known developer .\r\n1999-2013 : The developer has developed the land into residential plots and sold to individuals\r\n2018- Jan - I bought this plot from 4th owner through sale deed .\r\n2018-Jun : A case was filed by 4 brothers of A , that they have the share in the land and the sale was illegal etc. against the developer\r\n2019- Sep: The claimants got an interim order , though the developers filed a counter ,but the order copy says no counter filed . Still not sure if there was any gap.\r\n2020-March 26(Lock down) - A few miscreants , disturbed the land boundaries - The moment I came to know I filed a complaint and case registered (FIR).\r\n2020-May: The inspector called both of us and said will speak to developer and asked the miscreants to stop any disturbance\r\n2020-Jun : The miscreants again started nuisance to build a barricade against whole venture of 2 acres ; I managed to bring together all the owners(15) of the plots and the inspector again called both parties and lawyers . We came to know about orders etc during that time of interaction. The order was against developer not to \"Alienate\" ,but by 2015 all the plots were sold by the developer .\r\n\r\nThe developers' legal advisors are saying they will file counter in high court and say there is nothing to worry . But we as owners have decided to form an association and also fight on our rights as we are the title holders . (The claimants did not make us party while file petition). We also sense that the inspector is colluded with the miscreants. \r\n\r\nPlease help us to know chances of we losing the land and our hard earned money also advise us what should be our approach .",

In that connection he can execute an agreement of sale and grant a power of attorney that will allow the developer to further sell the property to prospective purchasers.\n- And further , as per law, if the property is self acquired property , then the owner of property is having right to transfer the same to any one , and no one can claim a right over the same, and hence the father of A has given the said property to A , and hence at the time of selling the same , the signature of other brothers were not mandatory legally.\u00a0\n- Since ,\u00a0A person A who acquired the property through his father has sold Land of 2 acres through GPA (registered) to person X\u00a0 , before 2017, hence the said GPA transfer to the builder was valid as per the Suraj lamp judgement.\u00a0\n- Hence further sale of the property to the buyers like you was a valid transaction , and the brothers of Mr A are having no right over the same .\u00a0\n- Further as the said property is using by you since last 18 years , hence also you can claim ownership on the ground of adverse possession as well."

        "query-text": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am from Bangalore and own a flat with a private terrace right, this terrace is unregistered to me and it is kept open. The builder has installed the water purifier system on my terrace from day one that provides purified drinking water to 90+ flats, this is 50% of the flats in our apartment and the installation is permanent. Every third day the maintenance team would visit my terrace to clean the water purifier and put some chemicals in it, I have provided a key to them for this purpose. \r\n\r\nThere is no legal contract or any agreement that says the water purifier be installed, it is a generic statement that is mentioned in my sale deed that the terrace should be kept open and accessible for management of any problems. The water purifier installed on the terrace has caused more issues such as damaging my inner roof and causing water leaks in my bedroom. \r\n\r\nThis is an issue from the beginning and I spent close to 1.5 lacs in 2013 to construct the waterproofing systems in the terrace to prevent water leaks but since the association doesn't maintain the area around the water purifier rightly the problems resurfaced again two years ago, when I approached the association they said they would fix the issue but haven't fixed it. I understand from news articles that selling and owning the open terrace is illegal. I understand that removing a water purifier can have problems both short and long-term. \r\n\r\nSo I am looking for the below clarifications.\r\n\r\n1. Since the builder provided terrace rights does this mean am I the owner and will have to maintain the terrace at my expense? I would like to know what is the law on terrace ownership and BBMP aspects as well.\r\n2. Even if I own the terrace, shouldn't the area around the water purifier be maintained by association here? I requested to apply a waterproof solution around the water purifier area and agreed to address it Though they said in emails they would address yet it is not addressed. When I recently sent an email, I got a not-so-great response, and seems they are not interested in addressing the issues. \r\n3. How do I make them accountable to address any problems arising from this water purifier thing? In my opinion, this wouldn't be the last issue and I am seeking a peaceful and amicable solution. \r\n\r\nEven two years ago there was a water leak happening from block joints due to some paint works carried out by the association in the terrace since the association couldn't address it on time one of my bedroom walls had a complete fungus and I spent close to 20K to fix the issue internally, the association addressed the issue externally after repeated followups, long delays and multiple escalations last year. I couldn't use this bedroom for more than 6 months.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your responses.",

They did defend the relevance of laws, though kept away from replying on my basic query I.e. why dowry prohibition act is just a tool for girl parties to take revenge and is fully inactive in stopping wrong practices of dowry in society. Why the prejudice that boy can only be culprit. I have some observation. I want some erudite lawyer to contest this. Mostly dowry was initiated by girl party and propagated by them. How I would explain. Some rich parents had not so competent girls. So if gone properly could not get good boys. To compensate this they used money or property as a leveller. The result was that good boys were all purchased by capable people and good girls from simple parents were left with leftovers only. So mismatch. Generation started changing. Boys were no more getting tempted with money. So again trouble for dabangg parents with unlikable girls. So started the kidnapping of good boys from weaker family, because they cannot apply force on equally dabangg,s son. Again good boys missing for good girls. So mismatch again. But law always seeming to favour girls is basically unfavouring the rightful people. good girls and good boys from weaker family backgrounds are the only sufferers. Core reason is the biased law.how to justify having such laws.",

        "query-text": "It is said \"Marriages are made in heaven\" only when it is amongst 2 souls - who vowed to stay together despite all odds & accepting each other as they are till their lifetime. But in our country nowadays, marriages are held between 2 families & it is truly difficult to please every single one there. However, I seem to have lost this game since last 5 years & is presently suffering from severe emotional/mental/psychological abuse from my Wife & In-Laws.\r\n\r\nI'm the only child of my parents & my parents have always longed for a \"daughter\" who would be with them & take care of them in my absence. So, we unanimously informed my in laws that we won't accept a single penny or any expensive gifts/furniture/vehicle/grants for my marriage. Mine was an arranged marriage legally registered on 23/09/12 & I socially got married on 23/01/2013. Immediately after the legal marriage, we exchanged gifts with my wife & in-laws during the Durga Puja of 2012. Thereafter one day, my father-in-law called me with my parents to their house & humiliated us there stating that we should have gifted my wife (would be) a saree instead of a Salwar Suit. Due to this, we have actually insulted them in front of their relatives. This was the beginning of my so called Married Life.\r\n\r\nMy wife is really impatient, short tempered & misunderstanding in nature from the very beginning. Now, may it be a love or an arranged marriage, it takes some time for both the families to understand/adjust to each other. My parents could never crack a joke with each other in presence of my wife as she would misunderstand that they are getting sarcastic with her. She used to become violent verbally & start abusing my parents (& sometimes even me). Many a times, me & my parents have tried explaining her that she need to be patient & stop misunderstanding us as we have no intention to humiliate/abuse her. But she opted for the opposite way rather. Many a times I have approached her parents to make her understand but they have always taken their daughter's side without listening to me or understanding my situation.\r\n\r\nIn May 2014, I got blessed with a baby girl & now she is 3+ years old. My parents took absolute care of her (during my office hours) for her entire tenure of pregnancy & always kept her at our apartment rather than asking her to stay with her parents. My daughter is also very very close to my parents & can't live without them. But with time, my wife became so severely violent towards my parents & myself that she used to abuse/insult us almost daily. Numerous days I have taken leave from my office due to her. I even suffered a professional demotion due to all these ongoing mental trauma. On 20th April 2017, she abused us in such a way that I asked her to leave my parent's apartment immediately for an indefinite period unless I procure a new apartment for her.",

Where a gift is made in writing, it is called Hibanama.

Mere fact that the donor is an illiterate person or is a woman in purdah is not sufficient to establish that the donor could not understand the legal implications of his declarations or that there was an undue influence.\nGifts must be made honestly, i.e. with a bona fide intention to give the property to the donee. A declaration of gift with an intention to defraud the creditors of the donor is voidable at the option of such creditors. However, the mala fide or fraudulent (dishonest) intention of the donor cannot be presumed only by the fact that he incurs certain debts. The mala fide intention must be fully established."

The firm remains liable to be sued by persons outside it, and cannot plead a set-off. Only suits for dissolution of the firm, and the powers of official assignees under the Insolvency Acts, are exempt from the prohibition. A small and harmonious firm dealing in a small way and mainly for ready money might be content to take these risks, mitigated as they are by the proviso of sub-s (4)(b) as to claims not exceeding Rs 100 in value. For a business of any considerable magnitude they appear sufficiently deterrent. Mandatory character\nNow, the mischief primarily intended to be prevented by the mandatory provisions of Section 69 was the hardship and difficulty to which third parties dealing with a firm were subjected in the matter of proving as to who were the partners. As to the provisions affecting the partners themselves it seems clear that the main object and intention of the Legislature was to prevent a partner from enforcing his claims against fellow partners if the firm was not registered and to compel in such a case dissolution of the firm by laying down that the court will entertain suits only when dissolution and accounts and winding up of the affairs of the firm is sought or where accounts or winding up of the affairs of an already dissolved firm is sought.\nEffect of Subsequent Registration\nHARRIES CJ of the Patna High Court explained the reasons for this approach:\n\"Subsequent registration cannot cure the initial defect. A plaint filed by an unregistered firm is in fact no plaint at all, because Section 69 makes claims arising out of a contract unenforceable if the firm is unregistered at the date of the institution of the suit. An unregistered firm has no right to sue and, therefore, a plaint filed by it has no legal effect. If at the time the plaint is filed the claim is bound to fail, how subsequent registration can improve the position. The single Judge of the Calcutta High Court held that there was no reason why the court should not treat the plaint as filed on the date of registration. But I know of no provision of law, which permits a court to treat a plaint as filed on a date subsequent, to the date upon which it was actually filed. The best course in such a case for the suer to adopt is to institute a fresh suit after registration and the court will entertain it if it is still within time.\nThere will also be this further difficulty that once a dispute between the partners has arisen, all of them may not sign the application form and consequently the firm may remain unregistered and even if registration is obtained by dropping the names of adversaries, those whose names do not figure in the registration cannot still be sued as partners. It is, therefore, advisable to have the firm registered when it is constituted. Partners cannot be compelled to sign registration documents, nor an action is allowed to so compel them. Registration of Sub-partnership A sub-partnership, (Section 29), is the agreement by a partner to share his share of the profits with certain other persons. Since the Partnership Act applies to such partnerships also, for the purposes of suits as between them registration of the sub-partnership would seem to be necessary. Such firms have been recognized as valid for registration purposes.\nScope of Sec.69 (1) And Matters Outside Its Preview\nTwo conditions are necessary to enable a partner to sue his co-partners or the- firm. First, the firm should be registered and, second, the name of the partner suing must figure in registration. The scope of the sub-section was examined by the Bombay High Court in S.H. Patel v. Husseinbhai Mohd, a case where the action was between two former partners to enforce an agreement restraining the outgoing partner from carrying on in some area any business similar to that of the firm and the court had to examine whether such suit was maintainable the firm being unregistered.\nThere are many settled laws in this regard, you may make a search in google."

If your wife is showing violent behavior towards you and your children, your first priority should be to ensure everyone's safety. Domestic violence is a serious issue that requires immediate attention. You might want to consider seeking help from professionals or support services specialized in handling such situations.\nI'm really sorry to hear about the difficult situation you're facing. In India, divorce laws fall under the Hindu Marriage Act, the Special Marriage Act, and the Indian Divorce Act, depending on the religious affiliations of the couple. For a mutual divorce, both parties need to agree to the terms of the separation. If your wife is willing to agree to a mutual separation, you can file for a mutual divorce under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act, which requires both parties to have lived separately for at least one year before filing the petition. However, if your wife is not cooperative and is showing violent behavior, it's crucial to prioritize your and your children's safety. In cases of domestic violence, you can seek legal help and protection.\u00a0It's essential to document instances of abuse or violence and gather evidence to support your case. This could include seeking medical help for any injuries, keeping records of abusive behavior, and gathering witnesses if possible. You can reach out to us for further assistance"

Beneficiaries of the wills are two different persons however beneficiary of the 1998 will has been excluded from the 2004 will by clearly writing that the executor of the will does not want to give anything to her. However it is now mentioned anywhere in 2004 will that 1998 will has been cancelled. There is a standard language written in both the will that this is my first and last will.\r\n\r\nSo Sir/mam, according to you which will would be validated by the honorable judge?",

Manavala Chetty and\u00a0Ors. v. P. Ramanujam Chetty and Anr. (1971) a single judge of the Madras High Court on the duty of the court of construction to give intention to the wishes of the testator opined:\n\"It is the obvious duty of the Court to ascertain and give effect to the true intentions of the testator and also avoid any construction of the will which will defeat or frustrate or bring about a situation which is directly contrary to the intentions of the testator. At the same time, it must be borne in mind that there are obvious limits to this doctrine that the Court should try to ascertain and give effect to the intentions of the testator. The law requires a will to be in writing and it cannot, consistently with this doctrine, permit parol evidence or evidence of collateral circumstances to be adduced to contradict or add to or vary the contents of such a will. No evidence, however powerful it may be, can be given in a Court of construction in order to complete an incomplete will, or project back a valid will, if the terms and conditions of the written will are useless and in-effective to amount to a valid bequest, or to prove any intention or wish of the testator not found in the will. The testator's declarations or evidence of collateral circumstances cannot control the operation of the clear provisions of the will. The provisions of the\u00a0Indian Succession Act\u00a0referred to earlier indicate the limits of the Court's power to take note of the testator's declarations and the surroundings circumstances, i.e., evidence of collateral circumstances.\"\n\u00a0\nSection 73 of Indian Succession Act, Sub-section (1) & (2) says:\n(1) No unprivileged will or codicil, nor any part thereof, which has been revoked in any manner herein before required, & showing an intention to revive the same.\n(2)\u00a0When any Will or codicil, which has been partly revoked and afterwards wholly revoked, is revived, such revival shall not extend to so much thereof as has been revoked before the revocation of the whole thereof, unless an intention to the contrary is shown by the Will or codicil.\n\u00a0\nSo, the only way in which an unprivileged will or codicil can be revoked have been specified there to be\n(1) marriage\n(2) another will or codicil\n(3) some writing declaring an intention to revoke the same & executed in the manner in which an unprivileged will is required to be executed, or\n(4) the burning, tearing or otherwise destroying the same by the testator, etc.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf the mode adopted by the testatrix is not one of the four modes which are prescribed in\u00a0Section 70 of Indian\u00a0Succession Act, the revocation of the unprivileged will or codicil cannot be brought about. Therefore, it is necessary to see the contents of both the wills for concrete opinion. Intention of words needs to be looked into.\n\u00a0\nYou may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.\n\u00a0\nGopal Verma,\nAdvocate on Record & Amicus Curiae,\nSupreme Court of India"

Please see the following judgment of Supreme Court on the issue of GPA sales.\n========================================================================================\nNo property sale on power of attorney: Supreme Court\nProperty sales through the common practice of general power of attorney (GPA) will not give ownership title to the buyer.\nIn a landmark judgment that is expected to send a large number of property owners into a tizzy, the Supreme Court held that the GPA method of immovableproperty sales is not a valid form of transfer of property.\nA three-judge bench presided over by Justice R. V. Raveendran said that property can be lawfully transferred only through registered sale deeds.\n\"A power of attorney is not an instrument of transfer in regard to any right, title or interest in an immovable property,\" the bench said, after interpreting various provisions of the law concerning property sales. However, the bench said the judgment will not affect \"genuine transactions\" under the GPA.\nThe judgment delivered on Wednesday would have an impact on both freehold and leasehold properties and affect the mode of transfer of property in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) where GPA sales are very common. Even though it can cause some hardship to those who have already purchased property through the GPA, the order will help curb evasion of duties, flow of black money into real estate and also save people from being cheated by unscrupulous owners selling the same property to several people.\n\u2022\tFlat sold by builder to third party whem my Agreement to sale was valid\nI had executed a Agreement to sale on one flat at Agra U.P. in 02/11/2012 with a validity of 15 months ,after 15 months the builder with mutual consent and reason that the the construction work is not over renewed it for another 12 months upto 28/01/2015,again with the same reason it sought and extension of another 6 months of agreement to sale which was made and agreement to sale was extended upto 22/07/2015.\nAfter this we issued a notice to the builder and on reply to notice the builder through its legal counsel sought again time upto 15/10/2015.Subsequently again a notice was given on 17/10/2015 to execute the sale deed but the builder again replied by letter and sought extension upto 15/07/2016 with the same reason that flats are incomplete.After 15/10/2016 the builder is untraceable and recently he was arrested on forgery charges and currently in jail.On enquiry I came to know that the builder sold my flat that was having valid agreement to sale to third party with sale deed dated 28/06/2014.During this period my agreement to sale was valid but now builder is in jail what is the legal remedy and the party having sale deed has occupied the flat .now what is the legal remedy me to get my flat back.\nSection 53A in The Transfer of Property Act, 1882\n1[53A.

Usually if you file a case before the court or handled by arbitrator it normally requires 6 to 18 months to conclude the adjudication.\nWhen a partner dies, subject to any contract to the contrary, partnership is dissolved. Section 42 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 (\u201cAct\u201d) provides for dissolution of partnership on occurrence of certain contingencies which includes \u2018death of the partner\u2019 as one of those contingencies. Plain reading of the Section 42 would show that, subject to the contract between the partners, a firm stands dissolved by death of a partner. However, in cases where the terms of the partnership deed are silent on continuation of partnership\u2019s business, a contract to continue the partnership after the death of a partner may be implied from the conduct of the parties. This means that where it is evident that such an intention was present, the nominee or legal representative of the deceased partner can take the place of deceased partner and business of the firm can be continued with the presumption that the partnership was never dissolved on the death of that partner. The above legal position is based on two assumptions- (a) there are more than two partners in the firm, and (b) the legal representatives are interested in taking forward the business of the firm."

A GPA will give broad authorizations to the individual you grant it to.\nIf you get GPA notarized through Any notary in USA, the same will still require to be\u00a0authenticated by the Indian embassy or consulate.\nYou can get \u00a0the GPA attested directly by the Indian embassy or consulate in that country any, it will be considered to be a valid notary.\nYour brother or father \u00a0to whom the GPA is granted should get the deed registered in the Sub-Registrar office in the area where property is situated or the place of residence.\nThe GPA shall have get the sale deed executed in you name, these conditions you should mention in your GPA deed itself also.\nFor transfer of owner ship in India there is requirement of a registered sale deed to be executed, if the same gets executed in you name, you will be the owner an will acquire all the rights of the owner.\nIn case of transfer of property by NRI, the stamp duty, registration fees are all the same as are in case of purchase of property by a resident.\u00a0Non-resident Indians have an advantage in terms of tax benefits. They can enjoy the same tax benefits that an Indian resident is entitled to on purchase of a property. NRIs can claim a deduction of INR 1 Lakh under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. If the property is sold within two years of its purchase\nThere is no difference of process.\npros of the process of having a GPA execute a sale deed in you name is that you won't need to come to India.\ncon of the process is that there are many chances where improper execution of GPA leads to problems or legal issued later on.\n\u00a0\nWhen it comes to purchase of property making the same in person is the safest route. But having said that if you draft a proper deed through with good legal assistance there are less chances of there being a legal issue later.\n\u00a0\nThank you"

Thus being from agri family is not a need, regardless of it you can buy agri land.\n3) In Karnataka, the Karnataka Land Revenue Act 1966 has prescribed the procedure to convert agricultural land to non-agricultural, under Section 95 of the Act.\nThe purpose for the change in use of land must be specified. The Deputy Commissioner may grant permission and may even impose conditions. The law prescribes a penalty in case of violation of the procedures.\n4) Conversion involves seeking the approval from the competent revenue authority which is the Collector, Sub-divisional Officer (SDO) or Tehsildar. The process can also be undertaken online through govt site.\nThank you"

In case, a person wishes to use it for non-agricultural purposes like residential, commercial, industrial, etc. then legal permission must be obtained by paying a nominal fee to the District Commissioner. Hence, the process is often referred to as DC Conversion.\nThe process includes obtaining No Objection Certificate from the Town Planning Authority under Section 95 of the Karnataka Land Revenue Act. 1964.\nLand conversion is not permitted for all properties. DC conversion may be cancelled or withdrawn by DC without prior notice to the applicant.\nIf you are planning to purchase a site which has not been converted by the DC then it will become your duty to apply for the process of the conversion for which the following documents are to be submitted along with the application form:\nOriginal record of Rights and Tenancy Certificate.\nPhotocopy of Atlas of the land- which shows the actual measurement of the land for conversion in meters and must be signed by the concerned authority of Department of Survey Title and Land Records.\nPhotocopy of Revenue Survey Map of the village that shows the location of the land.\nSite Plan- in case the conversion is proposed for construction purpose.\nAny other information required by the authority.\nThe authority, on receiving an application, requests the department of town and country planning (DTCP) to issue NOC for converting the land.\nNow you can think whether you would like to go ahead with the purchase of the site or not."

The mutual fund company has told me I need to get either a succession certificate or a letter of administration. (they are ok with either).\r\n\r\nMy question is which one should I go for? My mother did not create a will. Since there is no will, would a letter of administration be applicable, or is succession certificate the only option? I have tried going through the Indian Succession Act 1925, but I am not able to find clarification on whether one should do letter of administration or succession certificate if no will is present.\r\n\r\nThe religion is Hindu. Her heirs are me and my father (I am the only child), and my father is ok with me claiming the proceeds, and is willing to provide no objection letter if required.

Northern India Transport Insurance Co. observed as under: (SCC p. 788, paras 67) \n \n\t\u201cThe pecuniary loss to the aggrieved party would depend upon data which cannot be ascertained accurately but must necessarily be an estimate or even partly a conjecture.

Once such a defence is taken, the onus is on the insurer. But even after it is proved that the licence possessed by the driver was a fake one, whether there is liability on the insurer is the moot question. As far as owner of the vehicle is concerned, when he hires a driver, he has to check whether the driver has a valid driving licence.\n\tThereafter, he has to satisfy himself as to the competence of the driver. If satisfied in that regard also, it can be said that the owner had taken reasonable care in employing a person who is qualified and competent to drive the vehicle.\nxvi] National Insurance Co. Ltd.

Geeta Bhat and Ors. reported in A.I.R. 2008 S.C. 1837 wherein it was held that notwithstanding the fact that licence possessed by the driver is fake one, the insurance company would not be absolved from the liability of reimbursement for the final amount of compensation payable by third party to the traveller.

During the registration of sale deed and while signing the documents, I have observed a statement in my sale deed document that \"Vendor earlier executed a Sale Deed vide Doc.No. 0000/15, dated 03.06.2015 in favour of Mr. XXXX ... Subsequently, of Mr. XXXX due to his personal reasons requested the Developer to cancel his allotment and return the amounts paid towards the said Plot. The Developer agreed for the said request of Mr. XXXX and returned the amounts paid by his and both the Developer and of Mr. XXXX executed a Cancellation Deed vide Doc.No. 00000/15 dated 20/07/2015 cancelling the said Sale Deed.\" (Document numbers are quoted as 0000 for confidentiality)\r\n\r\nThen I questioned the Vendor but he convinced me that plot was registered as a collateral security and now they are cancelling the earlier registered sale deed to make it a clear title. Please note, before we went for registration, HDFC bank has approved the loan. So I thought bank has verified the legality and it is safe to proceed further. In fact said investor has come to the registrar office and he was one of the witnesses in my sale deed registration too. Then I agreed for it and continued with registration process. My sale deed has references to the said Cancellation of Sale Deed Doc. No. too. However, Vendor has not informed the same (cancellation of sale deed) to the bank when my loan request was submitted. During cheque disbursement, branch manger saw the linked documents and Cancellation Deed and said they cannot disburse the cheque until the documents are re-verified. Now Vendor promising me that he will take care of the issue and there won't be any problem. \r\n\r\nI have gone through various reviews in internet and observed that as per 'The Specific Relief Act, 1963', cancellation of Sale Deed should be ordered by Court and Registrar cannot cancel the sale deed. \r\n\r\n1) Is my understanding correct on 'The Specific Relief Act, 1963'?\r\n2) Does said Investor or his legal heirs will have any legal rights on the property? \r\n3) Can you confirm whether the Cancellation of Sale Deed is valid? As we didn't go through the process of appearing before the court?\r\n4) Am I in safe situation or do I have to take any preventive steps at this moment?",

A Full Bench of the Madras High Court in the case of Muppudathi Pillai Vs. Krishnaswami Pillai, AIR 1960 Madras 1 elaborately discussed the provision of Section 39 (New Section 31) and held:- \n12. The principle is that such document though not necessary to be set aside may, if left outstanding, be a source of potential mischief. The jurisdiction under Section 39 is, therefore, a protective or a preventive one. It is not confined to a case of fraud, mistake, undue influence, etc. and as it has been stated it was to prevent a document to remain as a menace and danger to the party against whom under different circumstances it might have operated. A party against whom a claim under a document might be made is not bound to wait till the document is used against him. If that were so he might be in a disadvantageous position if the impugned document is sought to be used after the evidence attending its execution has disappeared. Section 39 embodies the principle by which he is allowed to anticipate the danger and institute a suit to cancel the document and to deliver it up to him\n59. After giving our anxious consideration on the questions raised in the instant case, we come to the following conclusion: \u2013\n(i) A deed of cancellation of a sale unilaterally executed by the transferor does not create, assign, limit or extinguish any right, title or interest in the property and is of no effect. Such a document does not create any encumbrance in the property already transferred. Hence such a deed of cancellation cannot be accepted for registration. (ii) Once title to the property is vested in the transferee by the sale of the property, it cannot be divested unto the transferor by execution and registration of a deed of cancellation even with the consent of the parties. The proper course would be to re-convey the property by a deed of conveyance by the transferee in favour of the transferor. (iii) Where a transfer is effected by way of sale with the condition that title will pass on payment of consideration, and such intention is clear from the recital in the deed, then such instrument or sale can be cancelled by a deed of cancellation with the consent of both the parties on the ground of non-payment of consideration. The reason is that in such a sale deed, admittedly, the title remained with the transferor. (iv) In other cases, a complete and absolute sale can be cancelled at the instance of the transferor only by taking recourse to the Civil Court by obtaining a decree of cancellation of sale deed on the ground inter alia of fraud or any other valid reasons. \n60. Having regard to the conclusions arrived at as aforesaid, the questions referred are answered accordingly. The appeals are referred back to the concerned Court for deciding the case on merits"

Once the vendor has divested himself of his ownership over the property then he retains no control or right over the said property and he cannot purport to create any document in regard to the same.\nThere is no provision in the Transfer of Property Act or in the Registration Act, which deals with the cancellation of deed of sale. Registration Act confers no power with the Registrar to cancel a document which had validly been registered as per the Act.\nSection 62 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 which provides that contract which need not be performed. By that provision, any novation, rescission and alteration of a contract can be made only bilaterally. A deed of cancellation will amount to rescission of contract and if the issue in question is viewed from the application of Section 62 of the Indian Contract Act, any rescission must be only bilaterally.such cancellation deeds which are executed bilaterally by both the parties to the earlier document can be registered by the Registering Officer, provided, the other requirements of the Indian Registration Act are satisfied. \nIn your case a bilateral deed is executed so it may be valid .The better things is Mr. XXXX has only the power to create a relinquishment deed in favour of Builder if he wish to cancel the earlier sale deed ."

This\nsection is manifestly in two parts. Whereas the\nword used in the first part is \u2018may\u2019 the word used\nin the second part is \u2018shall\u2019.

In these cases, the petitioners challenged the action of the respondents Municipalities in highhandedly demolishing their property without following any provisions of law and without paying any compensation.\nW.P.No.13603 of 2003:\n2. The petitioner is the owner and occupier of the building bearing door No.7-6-23, situated in Narsapur Municipality and he was paying taxes regularly. A part of the said building is used for his residence and the other part is used for his clinic, since he is a medical practitioner. There was a road to the northern side of the building. The Narsapur Municipality wanted to widen the road and put marking on the houses of either side of the road. When the Narsapur Municipality did not pay any compensation, the neighbours of the petitioners building filed W.P.No.6430 of 2003 before this Court. This Court passed an order on 10.04.2003, after hearing both sides, and the said order was a general order made applicable to all but not confined only to the parties in the writ petition. The petitioner was under the impression that the respondents would follow the said order in respect of his property also. But, on 24.06.2003, respondents, without issuing any notice, highhandedly and arbitrarily entered his premises and demolished a part of his building. He stated that he did not give any consent or agreed to remove the building. In the process of demolition, the furniture and other articles in the clinic of the petitioner were badly damaged. The officials of the Municipality, though are public servants, took law into their hands and demolished the building indiscriminately. Even though markings were made on the houses of both sides of the road, buildings on one side of the road were only demolished in order to help the other side owners. Thus the Municipality acted arbitrarily. In those circumstances, the petitioner challenged the action of the Narsapur Municipality for taking possession of his land to an extent of nearly 60 square yards and sought compensation for the damage caused to the furniture and other articles in the building to the tune of Rs.3,00,000/-. He sent a representation on 27.06.2003 to the respondents by registered post with acknowledgement due and though they have received the same on 28.06.2003 but no reply was given.\n3. No counter-affidavit was filed by the respondents even after ten years. This Court, noticing that similar type of cases are coming before the Court frequently, by an order dated 31.03.2011, directed the Chief Secretary to Government to file an affidavit stating whether a circular as directed by this Court in case of Bantharam Bichappa and Others V. District Collector, R.R.District was issued, and if it was issued, whether any action was taken against those officials who have not complied with the same. This Court while passing the said order also noticed a decision in Keshav Prashad V. Commissioner and Special Officer, MCH, Hyderabad and others , wherein a Division Bench of this Court, while dealing with the case of demolition of a construction for the purpose of road widening, observed that in view of the Constitutional mandate under Article 300-A, the right to property cannot be taken away except in accordance with law.\n4. Pursuant to the said orders of this Court, the Chief Secretary to Government filed an affidavit on 26.12.2012 stating that the Government issued G.O.Ms.No.243, MA & UD (J1) Dept., dated 28.06.2011, issuing instructions to take action strictly as per the judgments of this Court in cases relating to acquisition of private properties and not to enter into private properties except through due process of law. Those instructions were also issued to Secretariat Departments/Head of Departments/District Collectors directing to issue necessary instructions to all the Subordinate Officers to follow the above directions invariably, failing which, it was stated, that it would be viewed seriously and appropriate disciplinary proceedings would be initiated against the officers violating those instructions. A perusal of the above GO would indicate that the orders of this Court in W.P.No.9780 of 1999, dated 28.03.2000 and W.P.No.13603 of 2003, dated 31.03.2011, were taken into consideration while issuing those instructions.\nW.P.No.17769 of 2006:\n5. This writ petition was filed challenging the action of the respondents in demolishing two storied front portion of the house property of the petitioner bearing Door No.15/303 in Ward No.15, Subedarpet Road, Nellore, to an extent of 468 square feet without initiating proceedings under the Land Acquisition Act.\n6. It is the case of the petitioner that she is the owner of house bearing D.No.15/303 situated in Ward No.15 of Subedarpet Road, Nellore. The said house was gifted to her by her mother at the time of her marriage in the year 1974. Her name was also mutated in the records of the municipality. While so, on 07.12.2002 she was called to the municipal office for negotiation for acquiring their house property for the purpose of road widening. Her husband attended the meeting and they expressed their willingness for acquisition on condition of payment of a reasonable compensation. Subsequently, another meeting was held on 03.08.2003 and they were offered alternate sites. Thereafter it was stated that no Government land was available with the Corporation and the petitioner along with others required to attend the meeting on 17.12.2004. As the husband of the petitioner is staying at a different place, he could not attend the meeting on that day and a notice was affixed on 17.12.2004 at 9.30 p.m. asking the petitioner to show cause why the building should not be removed for the purpose of road widening and they were asked to submit their explanation on or before 18.12.2004. When the petitioner came to know that the respondents were proposing to acquire 468 square feet of land along with two storied building and meagre compensation of Rs.3,64,000/- was fixed, a representation was submitted on 18.12.2004 stating that the proposed compensation of Rs.3,64,000/- was inadequate and the respondent was requested to initiate land acquisition proceedings. Instead of giving reply, the respondent demolished both ground floor and 1st floor on 18.12.2004 by using a proclainer. A word was sent to the husband of the petitioner to attend the office of the 3rd respondent and the husband of the petitioner was handed over a cheque for Rs.3,64,000/-. A legal notice was issued to the 3rd respondent on 24.01.2005. When no reply was issued to the said notice, the petitioner approached this Court by filing W.P. No.15533 of 2005. The said writ petition was disposed of at the admission stage by order dated 19.07.2005 directing the respondents to hear the petitioner personally and consider her representation dated 18.12.2004 and pass appropriate orders thereon. Again another notice was issued on 20.10.2005 and the same was served on the respondents. It was followed by another notice dated 27.10.2005. Ultimately, a final legal notice was issued on 20.01.2006 which was served on the respondents on 23.01.2006. When there was no response, a contempt case was filed in C.C. No.496 of 2006 and a notice was ordered in the said case on 06.06.2006. Upon receipt of the notice, the 3rd respondent issued a telegram on 22.06.2006 asking the petitioner to appear on 24.06.2006 to consider her representation dated 18.12.2004. Accordingly, the husband of the petitioner appeared and submitted his representation on 24.06.2006 along with estimates of damage caused to the building as well as the household articles by licensed surveyor. In those circumstances, when no action was taken on the said representation, the present writ petition was filed.\n7. A counter-affidavit was filed on 03.02.2011 stating that the husband of the petitioner received the cheque issued by the 3rd respondents for Rs.3,64,000/- towards compensation without any protest on par with other affected persons and the order of this Court in W.P. No.15533 of 2005 dated 19.07.2005 was received by them on 29.7.2005, but, since the concerned Town Planning Supervisor, who dealt with the subject, was dismissed from service on allegations pertaining to other municipality and did not hand over the connected files in time, action could not be taken. Later on, pursuant to the notice of the respondent, the petitioner attended the office of the Municipal Office on 24.06.2006 for personal hearing. It was intimated to her that compensation was paid with consent and the compensation was received at Rs.7,000/- per square yard on par with other affected persons and that the work of road widening was already completed and the road is in use and the additional compensation cannot be paid at that stage. Thus, the application of the petitioner dated 18.12.2004 was disposed of.\n8. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that there was no consent of the petitioner for demolition of the building without payment of proper compensation and the receipt of amount of Rs.3,64,000/- was not towards full and final settlement of the compensation. Had the petitioner agreed for the said amount, the petitioner would not have pursued the matter in 2005 and 2006 by sending notices and representations.\nW.P.No.20105 of 2006:\n9. This writ petition was filed by a widow aged about 55 years along with her two sons seeking a direction to the respondents to pay compensation for the land in T.S.Nos.103 and 104 of M.G. Cloth Market Road, Chirala taken possession from them and also for a direction to the respondents to pay the said compensation at the prevailing market rate.\n10. It is their case that the husband of the first petitioner and the father of petitioners 2 and 3 was the absolute owner and possessor of an extent of 224 square yards of the property situated in T.S.No.104 along with construction thereon bearing door No.14- 256 of Mahatma Gandhi Cloth Market Road, Chirala. He was also the owner of the land of an extent of 337 square meters situated in T.S.No.103 along with construction thereon bearing door No.14-257 and 258 of M.G.Cloth Market Road, Chirala. The Chirala Municipality passed a resolution on 20.10.1982 which was accepted on 29.05.1984 proposing to widen the road and extension of scheme road (M.G.D.T.P. Scheme Road) and addressed a letter to the District Collector, Prakasam District at Ongole for initiating land acquisition proposals. The District Collector, in turn, addressed a letter to the concerned Revenue Divisional Officer to complete preliminary formalities for acquiring the land. The Revenue Divisional Officer, in turn, directed the concerned Mandal Revenue Officer to inspect the site and submit a report for fixing the market value. At that stage also, the Chirala Municipality requested the District Collector to complete the process of acquisition as early as possible, by letter dated 11.06.1986. When the same was pending, the Chirala Municipality demolished the compound wall and a portion of the construction lying in the above door numbers in the year 1984. Though a portion of the property was demolished in the year 1984, the possession of the property was taken only on 15.04.1987 and neither land acquisition proceedings were initiated nor compensation was paid to the petitioner.\n11. In the meanwhile, the husband of the first petitioner and father of petitioners 2 and 3 died on 15.08.1989 and the case was prosecuted by the petitioners. One Councillor of the Chirala Municipality could take the compensation along with interest in respect of the portion of his property taken for the purpose of road widening on 13.09.1989. On the representation of the petitioners, the Director of Municipal Administration addressed a letter on 05.01.1990 asking the respondents as to how the amount of compensation was paid to the Councillor exclusively ignoring the claim of others. The petitioners submitted number of representations including one on 25.07.2006 which was received by the respondents on 26.07.2006. When no action was taken for two decades, the petitioner filed the present writ petition.\n12. A counter-affidavit was filed by the Commissioner of Chirala Municipality admitting the proposal to acquire the properties of land owners for road widening of a scheme road in T.S.Nos.103 and 104 of Chirala. The Chirala Municipality made correspondence with the revenue officials for acquisition of land on negotiations in respect of seven properties. The property of the petitioners was also affected to 337 and 491 respectively for widening of proposed 30 feet wide scheme road. The allegation that they demolished the compound wall and a portion of construction lying in the above property was denied. It was stated that they negotiated with the land owners for leaving the proposed portion to be widened voluntarily for public convenience and accordingly some of the land owners have accepted and removed a portion of their properties. The people of Chirala Municipality are utilising the same road since 1984 to till date. Some of the land owners did not claim any compensation and they left the properties excluded for widening purpose and some sold them to third parties also. It was also admitted that they have paid compensation to the Councillor on 30.09.1989. It was also stated that at that time none of the affected parties demanded payment of compensation, but they voluntarily removed the compound walls and allowed traffic for 17 years. But, surprisingly after 17 years, the representation dated 25.07.2006 was received from the petitioners for payment of compensation, and by not giving reasonable opportunity, the present writ petition was filed. The petitioners claim was barred by limitation and they cannot claim any right of compensation.\n13. In all the above three cases, the properties of the petitioners were demolished for the purpose of road widening highhandedly without issuing proper notice or giving sufficient time to the petitioners to take steps for voluntarily removing the structures while offering the amount of compensation. The respondents consistently took a stand that the petitioners consented for demolition of their properties for the purpose of road widening and they kept quiet, but started demanding payment of compensation at a later point of time. But the record belies their stand. The petitioners have been vigorously pursuing their cases and never accepted for demolition of their properties without receiving any compensation. The law also speaks of payment of compensation. It is well settled that the petitioners cannot be deprived of their right to property without due process of law.\n14. As stated supra, this Court in W.P.No.6430 of 2003, dated 10.04.2003, examined the issue and passed the following order: In P.Lakshmana Rao V. Executive Officer [2005 (5) ALT 246 (DB)], a Division Bench of this Court issued directions to be followed by Municipal authorities, Panchayat authorities and Revenue authorities for acquiring the land for public purpose. Having regard to the decision of the Division Bench, I have considered similar issue in a number of writ petitions and culled out various principles of law to be followed by the Government while acquiring/utilizing the private land for road widening. The principles were reiterated by my learned brother, Sri Justice B.Sudershan Reddy in M.Madhavi Latha V. Rajendranagar Municipality [2001 (2) ALT 482]. The principles laid down by the Division Bench are as follows:\n(1) Where a property is required for public purpose viz., widening of roads or for any other purpose, the authorities straightaway cannot take law into their hands and jump into the premises, dispossess or evict the occupants or demolish the property.\n(2) If the authorities concerned want to take action for eviction/dispossession of the occupants or demolition, they shall issue 60 days prior notice notifying as to the nature of the property, the property to whom it belongs and the proposed action calling for explanation/objections, if any, from the occupants. On receipt of such objections, if there is any objection as to the ownership of the property, the authorities should determine the extent of encroachment or unauthorised occupation and also determine whether the property in question belongs to Government/any other local self Government or authority or the occupants and pass appropriate orders within three months from the date of receipt of the objections, after affording an opportunity of being heard to the occupants.\n(3) In case where demolition of private property has already been made, the authorities shall determine the damages on the basis of the assessment to be made by the Engineer of the Roads and Buildings Department and disburse the amount of damages quantified forthwith.\n(4) If the demolition is in respect of local bodies Government property, the question of damages does not arise. In such event, the occupant shall be entitled to remove the material used for the construction.\n(5) In case of demolition of private property, the authorities concerned shall determine the loss caused to the occupants on the basis of the assessment to be made by the Engineer of R & B Department and on such assessment of damages, the concerned authorities shall take appropriate steps to disburse the amount quantified forthwith.\n(6) If there is any claim for grant/assessment of the property, the concerned authorities shall consider the same in accordance with law taking into consideration the eligibility and the entitlement of occupants, after making enquiry and till such claim is decided, there shall be status quo obtaining as on today regarding the structures.\nThe writ petition is disposed of in terms of the above directions. The respondents are further directed to maintain status-quo obtaining as on today till the claim is decided. No costs.\n15. This Court in way back in 2000 in Keshav Prashads case (2 supra), considered the issue as to whether the constructions raised by the owners could have been demolished for the purpose of widening of the road without their consent. In the said case, when the owner approached this Court seeking compensation for the demolished portion of the building, the Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad put forward a plea of consent of the owner before demolishing the property and when the owner denied such consent before this Court, this Court accepted the plea of the owner and held that the action of the respondent Municipal Corporation was wholly illegal and held that having regard to the provisions of Article 300(A) of the Constitution of India, such a constitutional right could not have been taken away except in accordance with law i.e., by taking recourse to the statutory provisions of acquisition by the State, by invoking the Doctrine of Eminent Domain or by purchasing the land upon holding the negotiations thereon.\n16. That was a case that arose out of the illegal action taken by the Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad. But in the case of highhanded and illegal action of taking possession of the land by the Irrigation Authorities in Bantharam Bichappas case(1 supra), this Court held that every citizen in this country has a right to posses property and the same cannot be deprived ordinarily except in the interests of the State, subject to the limitation prescribed by law. It was also held that the land was taken, was put to use and no notification to acquire the land was issued. In that case also, the officers were issued a notice and were given an opportunity to file their reply. Though they have not justified their action, they tried to explain by taking recourse to public interest and put forward the usual plea of taking possession with the consent of the owners. No such consent was produced before the Court. It was held that even if it was accepted that the owners had given oral consent for handing over the possession to the officers concerned, the officers were not within their rights to take over the possession because those officers were acting as the Agents of the Government and the Government could enter into a private property only after assumption of jurisdiction which could be assumed only after issuance of notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act. It was also held that no officer of the State Government is authorised to enter upon or take possession of the land belonging to private individuals unless and until a notification under Section 4(1) is published. However, during the pendency of the above case, notification was issued, 80% of compensation was paid to the owners and an award was also passed. This Court, noticing the said facts, held as follows:\nIn order to avoid such incidents in future, I direct that a copy of this order be sent to the Chief Secretary to the Government of Andhra Pradesh and he be requested to issue a circular to all the Government Officials directing them not to enter into private properties except through due process of law which would mean, after assuming the jurisdiction to acquire the land or property in accordance with the provisions of Land Acquisition Act.\n17. Even though that decision was rendered in the year 2000, only another decision in the year 2011 prompted the Government to issue G.O.Ms.No.243, MA & UD (J1) Dept., dated 28.06.2011, but the authorities continued to ignore the law and the orders of the Government while acquiring the private properties for the purpose road widening. The action of the authorities is clearly arbitrary and violative of Article 300(A) of the Constitution of India.\n18. Section 42 of the Andhra Pradesh Municipalities Act, 1965 (for short, the Municipalities Act) deals with the procedure for acquisition of immovable property under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 and it reads as follows:\n42. Procedure for acquisition of immovable property under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894:- (1) Any immovable property which any municipal authority authorised by this Act to acquire may be acquired under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, (Central Act 1 of 1894), and, on payment of the compensation awarded under the said Act in respect of such property and of any other charges incurred in acquiring it, the said property shall vest in council.\n(2) Where a municipal authority proposes to acquire any immovable property otherwise than under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, it shall obtain the previous approval of the District Collector therefor. While according his approval, the District Collector shall determine the value at which the property is to be acquired and every such acquisition shall be subject to the previous sanction of the Government.\n19. Section 172 of the Municipalities Act enables the Municipal Council to take up certain activities and it includes acquisition of land for the purpose of widening the road and it reads as follows:\n172. Powers of municipal authorities:- (1) The council may-\n(a) lay out and make new public streets;\n(b) construct bridges and sub-ways;\n(c) turn, divert or with the special sanction of the Government\npermanently close any public street or part thereof;\n(d) Widen, open, extend or otherwise improve any public street.\n(2) The owners and occupiers of any land or buildings which are acquired for, or affected by any such purposes shall be paid such reasonable compensation as may be determined by the executive committee.\n20. Further Section 174 of the Municipalities Act also enables the Municipal Council to acquire any land and buildings for improvement of streets and the relevant portion of it reads as follows:\n174. Acquisition of land and buildings for improvement of streets:- (1) The Council may acquire\n(a) any land required for the purpose of turning, diverting, opening, widening, extending, or otherwise improving any public street, or of making any new public street, and the buildings, if any, standing upon such land; and\n(b) any land outside the proposed street alignment, with the buildings, if any, standing thereupon:\nProvided that in any case in which it is decided to acquire any land under clause (b) of this sub-section, the owner of such land may retain it by paying to the council an annual sum to be fixed by the council in that behalf, or a lumpsum to be fixed by the council, not being less than twenty-five times such annual sum and subject to such conditions as the council thinks fit as to the removal of the existing building, if any, the description of the new building, if any, to be erected, the period within which the new building, if any, shall be completed and any other similar matters.\n(2) .\n(3) .\n(4) .\n(5) .\nThe above provisions indicate the power of the Municipality to acquire land or other immovable property for the public purpose under various circumstances. Though those salutary provisions exist, the authorities did not take action and highhandedly resorted to demolition of the properties. The properties of the petitioners were demolished and no legal proceedings were taken for payment of compensation in accordance with law. In almost all the cases, the plea taken by the respondents was that the owners consented for demolition and the action was justified in public interest. The respondents forgot the fact that the petitioners also form part of the public and their right to property is protected, though not as a Fundamental Right, but as a Constitutional Right under Article 300-A of the Constitution of India. That right of the petitioners cannot be violated except in accordance with law. The petitioners are entitled to be paid compensation in accordance with the provisions of the Municipalities Act as applicable to the individual cases. Though this Court was considering the identical issue time and again on number of occasions, the respondents have been following the law in breach only forcing the affected parties to approach this Court repeatedly.\n21. In view of the above facts, these writ petitions have to be allowed and consequently they are allowed directing the respondents to initiate action afresh under appropriate provisions of Andhra Pradesh Municipalities Act, 1965 and pay compensation to the petitioners to the extent of their properties affected and the said exercise shall be completed within a period of six months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. The amount paid to the petitioner in W.P.No.17769 of 2006 shall be deducted from the compensation amount determined under the provisions of Andhra Pradesh Municipalities Act, 1965. The respective Municipalities shall pay an amount of Rs.10,000/- each to the petitioners in the Writ Petitions towards damages for violating the Constitutional rights of the petitioners. Miscellaneous Petitions pending, if any in these writ petitions, shall stand closed"

In cases where the terms of the partnership deed are silent on continuation of partnership\u2019s business, a contract to continue the partnership after the death of a partner may be implied from the conduct of the parties. Section 42 of the Act does not apply where there are only two partners, since there cannot be a contract between the partners that on the death of one of them, the partnership will not be dissolved.\n In cases where the terms of the partnership deed are silent on continuation of partnership\u2019s business, a contract to continue the partnership after the death of a partner may be implied from the conduct of the parties. This means that where it is evident that such an intention was present, the nominee or legal representative of the deceased partner can take the place of deceased partner and business of the firm can be continued with the presumption that the partnership was never dissolved on the death of that partner. The above legal position is based on two assumptions- (a) there are more than two partners in the firm, and (b) the legal representatives are interested in taking forward the business of the firm.\nDissolving a partnership firm is different from dissolving a partnership. In the former case, the firm ends its name and hence cannot do business in the future. But in case of dissolving a partnership, the existing partnership is dissolved\u2013 by consent or on happening of a certain event, but the firm can retain its existence if remaining partners enter into a new partnership agreement.Dissolving a partnership firm means discontinuing the business under the name of said partnership firm. In this case, all liabilities are finally settled by selling off assets or transferring them to a particular partner, settling all accounts existed with the partnership firm.Any profit/ loss is transferred to partners in their profit sharing ratio as agreed by them in the partnership deed.\nDeath of a partner dissolves the partnership and the rights of the representatives of the deceased partner would depend on the provisions of the partnership deed.In the absence of any agreement or decision by arbitration, accounts will have to be prepared as on the date of death and the profit or loss ascertained. Apart from this additional point regarding the deceased partner\u2019s share of profits up the date of his death, the treatment in accounts is not different from that in case of retirement. After ascertaining the amount due to the deceased partner, the balance in his capital account should be transferred to an account opened in the name of his executors.\nSection 37 of Indian partneship act says Where any member of a firm has died or otherwise ceased to be a partner, and the surviving or continuing partners carry on the business of the firm with the property of the firm without any final settlement of accounts as between them and the outgoing partner or his estate, then, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, the outgoing partner or his estate is entitled at the option of himself or his representatives to such share of the profits made since he ceased to be a partner as may be attributable to the use of his share of the property of the firm or to interest at the rate of six per cent. per annum on the amount of his share in the property of the firm: Provided that whereby contract between the partners an option is given to surviving or continuing partners to purchase the interest of a deceased or outgoing partner, and that option is duly exercised, the estate of the deceased partner, or the outgoing partner or his estate, as the case may be, is not entitled to any further or other share of profits; but if any partner assuming to act in exercise of the option does not in all material respects comply with the terms thereof, he is liable to account under the foregoing provisions of this section.\nIn your case the existing partners started a new firm .So getting the share it must be file settlement of accounts suit of the firm. Upon realization, all assets will be sold off in the market, and the cash realizing out of such a sale will be used for paying the liabilities. Assets or liabilities may also be taken over by the partners for which the respective partner capital accounts will be adjusted by such amount. Capital contributed by each partner will be repaid to him in the capital contribution ratio."

Such cases have to be decided by labour court within a period not exceeding\u00a0Three Months.\nIf you are manager or executive level employee, you can file a case against the company in the civil court under order 37 of Court of civil procedure. This is faster than the usual slow procedure in civil courts, called a summary suit.

This is a reference to a Special Division Bench,\nunder the second proviso to Rule 1 Ch. II of the High Court Appellate Side Rules. The particular\nquestion of law referred for determination by the\nSpecial Bench is: \n\"What is the proper valuation of a suit for ejectment of a licensee upon revocation or termination of his licence for purposes of (1) Court-fees and (2) jurisdiction? Is there any difference in the matter between a case of revocation of licence and a case of termination as distinguished from revocation of licence?\"\n2. Facts, in so far as they are material for determination of this reference, lie within a short compass and are hereinbelow stated.\n3. The plaintiffs, who are the petitioners, filed a suit for eviction of the defendant opposite party, whom they described as a licensee, on the ground that the licence in favour of the defendant had been revoked. There were also certain other reliefs claimed by the plaintiffs, for example, mesne profits, but with those other reliefs I am not concerned at this stage. The relief, in so far as ejectment was concerned, was valued at Rs. 100/-, which according to the plaintiffs was the value of the said relief, and Court-fee was paid accordingly.\n4. The defendant in his written statement objected to the valuation of the relief as to ejectment and also objected to the Court-fee paid thereon. He contended that the suit had not been properly valued and the Court-fee paid was insufficient.\n5. On the pleadings, an issue, amongst others, as to valuation of the suit, for the purposes of the Court-fees, was framed.\n6. The learned Munsif heard the issue as a preliminary Issue, in the suit, and decided against the plaintiff. An extract from the order of the learned Munsif is set out below:\n\"In view of the decision reported in Satish Kumar v. Sailabasini Devi, AIR 1949 Cal 621, the valuation for the purpose of Court-fees in such a suit is governed by Section 7(v) of the Court-fees Act and the plaintiff is not entitled to put his own valuation on the suit. Relying on a case reported in Chandi Charan Das v. Sushilabala Dasi, , the learned lawyer for the plaintiff argues that the subject-matter of the suit is not the properties in respect of which the plaintiff claims relief but the relief itself. This would appear from the above decision itself, and in the above case their Lordships were concerned with the valuation of the suit only for the purpose of jurisdiction and not for the purpose of Court-fees. That apart, the above decision did not disturb the previous decision or valuation for the purpose of Court-fees and that decision was not overlooked. The learned lawyer for the plaintiff has also referred to a case reported in Prabirendra Nath v. Narendra Nath, , out this does not relate to Court fees matter. He has next urged that that valuation of the suit property cannot be ascertained in this case as the plaintiff has a very limited interest of tenancy therein. This contention has some legs to stand upon, but I find from the plaint itself that licence fee of Rs. 40/- p.m. was payable by the defendant to the plaintiff in respect of the suit property and on this basis I value the suit property at Rs. 7200/- under Section 7(v) of the Court-fees Act.\"\nSo far as the valuation of the suit at Rs. 100/-, for the purposes of jurisdiction, was concerned the learned Munsif, apparently did not disturb the valuation. Aggrieved by the order the plaintiff moved this Court.\n7. P. N. Mookerjee and Niyogi, JJ., who recommended the reference to a Special Division Bench, made the following observation:\n\"This has resulted in a very unsatisfactory state of things and the position has become somewhat anomalous, the suit, so far as ejectment is concerned being valued at Rs. 100/- for the purpose of jurisdiction and at Rs. 7200/- for the purpose of Court-fees.\"\n8. Their Lordships further observed that in view of several unalike decisions and the chaotic state of the law, on the point, as a result thereof, a reference to a Special Division Bench was plainly necessary and eminently desirable for an authoritative pronouncement of the law on the point,\n9. It is necessary for me, therefore, to examine, in the first place, the catena of case law on the point, in order to find out the guidance they may offer or the conflict of opinion they may raise. I shall first of all examine the reported decisions of this Court, in order of chronology:\n10. (i) Basiram Christian v. Ganesh Chandra Das Gupta, 24 Cal WN 187 Notes. In that case the plaintiff inter alia, prayed that upon a finding that he was in possession of the disputed property on the strength of a Mirash Karshapatta and adverse possession and upon a finding that the principal defendant was a licensee, whose licence was put an end to, a permanent injunction might be granted against the defendant restraining him from coming upon the land, after having removed him therefrom. The plaintiff also claimed damages. The plaintiff valued the suit both for the purposes of Court-fees and jurisdiction at Rs. 146/-\n-- Rs. 100/- being the value of ejectment and injunction and Rs. 46/- being the value of damages. The defendant disputed the valuation as arbitrary and contended that the value of the suit would be the value of the land, which was much more than Rs. 100/-. The learned Munsif upheld the plaintiffs valuation on the ground that the value of the subject-matter of the litigation was the value of the right of a licensee in the land and that right, according to law, had no value. Even if it be looked upon as a suit for recovery of possession, the learned Munsif observed, the possession of the licensee was the subject-matter of litigation, which the plaintiff wanted to recover from the licensee, and such possession had little or no value. On the matter being taken by the defendant, to the High Court, under Section 115, C. P. C., Newbould J., discharged the Rule, with the observation that in revision he was not prepared to say that the decision was wrong.\n11. (ii) AIR 1949 Cal 621 : This was a case of recovery of possession of house from a licensee, whose licence had been revoked. The plaintiff had put his own valuation to the relief claimed and paid Court-fees thereon. A. N. Sen, J., dissented from the decision in 24 Cal WN 167 (Notes) and also a Patna High Court decision, reported in Mt. Barkatunnissa Begum v. Mt. Kaniza Fatima, ILR 5 Pat 631 : (AIR 1927 Pat 140), which had taken a similar view. He cared to follow a decision of the Bombay High Court, reported in Ratilal v. Chandulal, AIR 1947 Bom 482 and observed.\n\"After a licence has been revoked all that the plaintiff requires is the recovery of the premises and that, it seems to me, would be the subject-matter of the suit. The plaintiff in the present case seems (seeks?) for nothing more and I hold that the subject-matter of the suit is the premises sought to be recovered. In this connection, I would refer to the provisions of Section 7(xi)(cc), Court-fees Act. There a special provision, has been made for the recovery of immovable property by a landlord from his tenant, including a tenant holding over after the determination of the tenancy. Now, if this provision had not been there, a suit by a landlord for recovery of possession of land from a, tenant, holding over after the tenancy had been determined, would have been governed by Clause (v) of Section 7. The Legislature thought fit to provide that such a case will not be governed by Clause (v) and it made a provision In Clause (xi) regarding Court-fees payable in such a case. There is no corresponding provision made by the Legislature in respect of a licensee whose licence has been revoked. It seems therefore, that the Legislature intended that in the case of a licensee the valuation of the suit should be governed by the provisions of Clause (v) of Section 7, Court-fees Act.\"\n12. (iii) . This was also a case of recovery of possession from a licensee, whose licence had been revoked. The suit was valued for the purpose of jurisdiction at Rs. 110/-. Objection was raised to the effect that the Munsif's Court had no pecuniary jurisdiction to try the suit. The objection succeeded. Before this Court both parties agreed that the Court-fees payable on the plaint should be in accordance with the provisions of Section 7(v) of the Court-fees Act, 'according to the value of the subject-matter'. It was not also disputed that taking the subject-matter to be the property, the value would be, for the purpose of Court-fee, well beyond the jurisdiction of the learned Munsif. The dispute centred round the point as to what would be the basis of valuation of the suit for the purpose of jurisdiction.\n13. Das Gupta, J., (sitting with Debabrata Mookerjee, J.), before whom the case came up for hearing, held that for the purposes of jurisdiction the subject-matter of the suit was not the property in respect of which the plaintiffs claimed relief but the relief itself, which was that the licensee should leave the land and the structures thereon.\n14. His Lordship gave several reasons for his conclusion: (a) Section 8 of the Suits Valuation Act (an Act passed to prescribe the mode of valuing certain suits for the purpose of determining the jurisdiction of Courts with respect thereto) provided that in suits other than those referred to in the Court-fees Act 1870, Section 7, paragraphs v, vi and ix and paragraph x. Clause (d), Court-fees were payable ad valorem under the Court-fees Act, 1870, the value as determinate for the computation of Court-fees and the value for the purposes of jurisdiction shall be the same. But in determining the value of a suit in which, like the suit before their Lordships, Court-fees were payable under Section 7(v) of the Court-fees Act, no assistance was to be had from the Court-fees Act because Section 8 deliberately excluded it from the application of the rule that the value as determinable for the purposes of Court-fees and the value for the purposes of jurisdiction shall be the same. It was, therefore, necessary, his Lordship said, to ascertain the value for the purposes of jurisdiction without assistance from the Court-fees Act but bearing in mind the language of Section 6, C. P. C., that 'in so far as otherwise expressly provided nothing herein contained shall operate to give any Court jurisdiction over suits the amount or the value of the subject-matter of which exceeds the pecuniary limits (if any) of its ordinary jurisdiction', (b) his Lordship did not fully agree with the view of the Bombay High Court reported in AIR 1947 Born 482 in which Macklin, J., held that in plain English the subject-matter of a suit under Section 7(v) was what the suit was about; it was not the same thing as the object of the suit --the object of the suit being the claim, in other words possession of the house; Macldin, J., held that where the suit was for possession of land, houses or garden the suit was to be valued according to the subject-matter and where the subject-matter was land the value was to be determined according to Clauses (a), (b), (c) or (d) of Section 7(v) and where the subject-matter was a house or garden the value was to be deemed to be the market value of the house or garden. Das Gupta, J., found no reason to differ from the view of Macklin, J., in so far as the valuation of such a suit for Court-fees was concerned but disagreed with the interpretation in so far as the valuation of such a suit for jurisdiction was concerned. According to his Lordship the distinction sought to be made between subject and object of the suit was misleading and even if not so his Lordship was unable to see how the fact that the Legislature had used the words in that particular sense in the Court-fees Act would justify the conclusion that in the Civil Procedure Code also the Legislature used the words in the same sense, (c) His Lordship gave certain Illustrations. In a lecture on the question whether Shakespeare and Bacon were identical persons, the subject-matter was neither Shakespeare nor Bacon but their identity; a club considering the question whether members should come in dhoti, the subject-matter was the desirability of the members attending the club in dhoti; also in a suit to enforce a right of irrigation from a tank, the subject-matter was neither tank nor the land to be irrigated but the right of irrigation. So also in a suit on a claim of ancient rights enjoyed by a house, the house was not the subject-matter but the relief which the plaintiff claimed.\n15. His Lordship held that as in all cases a suit is brought for a relief, the subject-matter is the relief. The fact that this relief is asked for in respect of movable or immovable properties does not make the property the subject-matter of the relief.\n16. In a suit for possession from a licensee on revocation of licence, the relief asked for was that the licensee should leave the property -- the value of this was obviously less than the value of the property over which the licence had been given. On such line of reasoning his Lordship held that the plaintiffs valuation of the suit at Rs. 110/-, for the purpose of jurisdiction, was not inadequate.\n17. His Lordship distinguished the decision by A. N. Sen, J., in AIR 1949 Cal 621, as concerned with the valuation of a suit for Court-fees alone.\n18. (iv) Hafiz Mohammad v. Haji Abdur Rub, . In that case, Lahiri, J., (sitting with Guha Ray, J.), held that a suit by a Mutwalli to recover possession of a Waqf property, alienated by a former mutwalli, where no declaration was prayed, was governed by Section 7(v) of the Court-fees Act and must be valued for the purposes of Court-fees accordingly. His Lordship further held that the subject-matter of the suit was the interest of the plaintiff in the land or building or garden. Where a plaintiff sought relief only as a mutwalli, his interest in the disputed property would be much narrower than the interest of a full owner and such interest need not be valued at the same figure as his interest as a full owner.\n19. (v) Birendra Kumar Dutta v. Charu Chandra Butt, . This was a case where the plaintiff filed a suit for declaration of title and recovery of possession of a masonry building on the allegation that the defendant in possession was a licensee and that a licence had been revoked. The suit was valued at Rs. 100/-. Sen, J., refused to recognise the distinction between valuation for the purposes of Court-fees and valuation for the purposes of jurisdiction in such a suit and held that such a suit was governed by Section 7(v) of the Court-fees Act and since the subject-matter was incapable of precise valuation, the plaintiff's valuation must be accepted. His Lordship criticised the decision in (supra), in the following language:\n\"In that case the Division Bench accepted the valuation put by the plaintiff of Rs. 110/- only, although if the market value of the land and the premises were accepted, the value would be much more. Mr. Banerjee has sought to distinguish this ruling by pointing out that their Lordships in the Division Bench case just cited were dealing with the valuation for the purposes of jurisdiction and not with the valuation for the purposes of Court-fees. I am however, unable to hold that there can be any distinction between the valuation for the purposes of jurisdiction and the valuation for the purposes of court-fees in such a suit. Section 8 of the Suits Valuation Act no doubt refers to suits other than those suits which are governed by Section 7, paragraphs (v), (vi), and (ix) and paragraph (x) Clause (d). Section 8 lays down that in such suits the value for court-fees and the value for jurisdiction shall be the same. This does not mean that the value for court-fees and for jurisdiction shall be different in a case governed by Section 7, paragraphs (v), (vi) and (ix) and paragraph (x) Clause (d). These cases are governed by Part I of the Suits Valuation Act. There is nothing in this Part to show that the value for the purposes of jurisdiction shall be less than the value as determined for the purposes of court-fees. On the other hand, when the suit is valued according to the subject-matter, it is clear that the same value shall govern the valuation for jurisdiction as well as the valuation for court-fees.\"\n20. (vi) Manik Chand v. Sudhir Kumar, . This was also a case where the plaintiff claimed khas possession of a premises on eviction of a licensee, whose licence had been revoked. The prayer of declaration of title, originally made, was omitted and, therefore, there was no question of application of Section 7(iv)(c) of the Court-fees Act and Section 7(v)(b) was the only provision of the Court-fees Act that was applicable. The trial Court, being of the opinion that ad valorem Court-fees was payable on the value of the property in suit, made an enquiry under Section 8-C of the Court-fees Act and directed the plaintiff to pay Court-fees on Rs. 12,000/-. The order was challenged on the ground that the subject-matter of the litigation was not the property but the right of the plaintiff to eject the licensee. It was contended before this Court that the value of this right must be less than the market value of the property. Das Gupta, J., (Guha, J., agreeing with him) observed;\n\"If the Legislature had contented itself by merely saying that in suits for possession of lands, buildings or gardens the amount of fee payable shall be computed according to the value of the subject-matter, there would have been much scope for the argument that the word 'subject-matter' should not be taken to be the same as the land, buildings or gardens. The Legislature Itself, however, proceeded to add that such value should be deemed to be 15 times the net profits which have arisen from the land, building or garden during the year next before the date of presenting the plaint, or, if the Court sees reason to think that such profits have been wrongly estimated, fifteen times such amount as the Court may assess as such profits or according to the market value of the land, building or garden, whichever is lower, and then if, in the opinion of the Court, such profits are not readily ascertainable, or assessable, or where there are no such profits, according to the market value of the land, building or garden.\"\nHis Lordship referred to the view expressed by A. N. Sen, J., in the case reported in AIR 1949 cal 621 and by Macklin, J., in AIR 1947 Bom 482 (supra), and thereafter further observed:\n\"Though the view taken above which, as I have staled earlier, was also the view taken by Sen J., in this Court, might result in hardship in many cases, I am unable to see how, on an interpretation of the Statute according to recognised rules, it is possible to escape the conclusion that this view is right. It is certainly possible to say that the subject-matter of a suit is really the relief for which the suit is brought. It was in that view that this Court held in , that the valuation for the purpose of jurisdiction should be made in such cases where a plaintiff asks for possession of the land from a licensee not on the basis of the market value of the land but on the valuation of the relief he wants to obtain by getting rid of the licensee. As was, however, pointed out in that very case, the interpretation of the word 'subject-matter' may well be different when the question of Court-fee has to be considered under Section 7(v) of the Court-fees Act.\nx x x x x x I can see nothing that would justify any different conclusion. Reference has been made to a decision of this Court in , where Lahiri and Guha Ray, JJ.. held that in a suit by Mutwalli to recover possession of the property it was the interest of the Mutwalli in the disputed property which forms the basis of the valuation and not the interest of the full owner. I am un able to see how this decision is of any assistance to the present petitioner. It is certainly true that the market value of anything has to be ascertain ed in respect of the particular interest. In one case it may be the landlord's interest, in another case it may be the tenant's interest and in another case it may be licensee's interest. So, when the plaintiff comes to Court as a mutwalli and his interest is to be valued, it is only reasonable to say that it is the market value of the mutwalli's interest which forms the basis. That is what was decided in Hafiz Mohamad's case, . Applying that rule to the present case,' the position is that the plaintiff's case being that of a full owner entitled to obtain possession from the licensee, it is his interest as full owner which is to be calculated.\"\nI need now to refer to three unreported decisions of this Court in order of chronology:\n21. (I) Civil Revn. Case No. 880 of 1948, Ratan Lal Goenka v. Krishna Kishore, decided by R. C. Mitter and Roxburgh, JJ., on [deleted] (Cal). In this matter, the plaintiff instituted a suit to eject the defendant on the allegation that the defendant had been let into the house as a licensee but since then his licence has been revoked. He valued the suit for the purposes of Court-fee at the figure of Rs. 2000/- and paid Court-fee on that valuation. An objection was taken that the Court-fee paid was insufficient inasmuch as the value of the house was much more than Rs. 2000/-. The Subordinate Judge directed the plaintiff under Section 8-A of the Court-fees Act to give a statement of valuation. The plaintiff moved against the order and contended that even though the case came under Section 7(v) of the Court fees Act, the plaintiff could be required only to pay Court-fees on the value not of the property, which he sought to recover, but on the value of the licence. The plaintiff relied, in support of his proposition, on the decision reported in ILR 5 Pat 631 : (AIR 1927 Pat 140). Their Lordships dissent-\ned from the Patna view and observed that the subject-matter of the suit was the house and therefore, the plaintiff must pay Court-fees on the value of the house, that is to say, land and building, in terms of Clause (v) of Section 7, i.e., fifteen times the net profit of the preceding year or if there was no net profit, according to the market value of the house, i.e., the land and building. Although of that opinion, their Lordships observed that it was an anomaly that for the recovery of property from a tenant a lesser amount of Court-fees had to be paid Tinder Clause xi(cc) of Section 7, viz., one year's rent and for recovery of possession from a licensee, whose right was more precarious than that of a tenant, a larger amount of Court-fee must be paid. But in respect of that anomaly, their Lordships observed, the Government alone may give relief, under Section 35 of the Court fees Act.\n22. (II) Civil Revn. Case No. 233 of 1949, (Benoy Krishna Das v. Mihir Lal Das) decided by K. C. Chunder, J., on July 15, 1949 (Cal). This was also a suit for possession of a bouse from a licensee, on revocation of licence. The plaintiff valued the suit at Rs. 100/- and the defendant questioned the valuation and contended that the suit must be valued at the value of the property. The trial Court negatived the contention of the defendant. Thereupon, the defendant moved this Court in revision. In making the Rule absolute, Chunder, J., observed that from general principle it was apparent that after revocation of, the licence there was a determination of the same and the previous licensee became a trespasser; there can be no question that a suit to eject a trespasser falls within Section 7(v) of the Court-fees Act: The case of a tenant was in pari matcria; he was also a trespasser after the determination of his tenancy by a notice to quit. But there was a special provision, in Section 7(xi)(cc), in case of, a tenancy. Where there was a special provision, his Lordship observed, the general provision of Section 7(v) would not apply. There was thus an anomaly causing greater hardship to licensers, who had revoked licences, than to landlords, who had determined a tenancy. His Lordship then, observed:\n\"But the law itself appears to be clear and, as far as this Court is concerned, now settled, A suit to recover possession from a licensee after revocation and determination of the licence is chargeable with Court-fee under Section 7(v), The value will be the subject-matter of the suit, that is, the house or portion of the house or land or building of which recovery of possession is sought and in accordance with the section the valuation will be 15 times the net profit of the preceding year, or if there is no such net profit, then according to the market value of the house or building or land or portion thereof.\"\n23. (III) Civil Revn. Case No. 1083 of 1958 (Bidyanand, Surekha v. Budhram) decided by Sen, J., on June 23, 1959 (Cal). In this case also a plaintiff, who had revoked a licence, sought to recover possession of a house from a licensee and valued the suit at Rs. 210/-. The defence was that the suit must be valued at Rs. 2000/-, being the market value of the house. The trial Court upheld the contention of the defendant. The plaintiff moved this Court in revision. His Lord-\nship referred to some of the cases hereinbefore referred to, namely, , and observed:\n\"The kind of relief sought being identical, it should make no difference whether the plaintiff seeks declaration of title as well as recovery of possession or seeks recovery of possession only as against a licensee whose licence has been revoked, in either case the valuation for the purpose of jurisdiction and Court-fees should be the same.\" Lastly, it is necessary for me to refer to two other decisions of this Court, in which the point for my determination collaterally arose, in order to complete the survey.\n24. (a) Kishori Mohan Ghosh v. Barada Pada, 98 Cal LJ 1. In this case the plaintiff sued to recover possession of a plot of land from a licensee, whose licence had expired. The suit was valued at Rs. 2000/- for value of land. On enquiry under Section 8-C of the Court-fees Act, it was found that the value of the land was Rs. 65,000/-. On the basis of the licence fee, which used to be paid, however, the valuation, under Section 7(v) of the Court-fees Act would come up to Rs. 8280/-. The trial Court accepted the latter value. The defendant moved against the order. It was contended that licence fee could not be treated as profits \"which have arisen from the land\". Chakravartti, C. J., (Labiri, J. sitting with him) observed:\n\"Had it been necessary in this case to decide whether licence fees dam be properly regarded as 'profits which have arisen from the land', I would be inclined to hold that they could be so regarded. It ought not to be forgotten that the Court-fees Act is looking at the matter from the point of view of the plaintiff in a suit for ejectment and the only profit which it can possibly have in contemplation must be the profit derived by the plaintiff. If rent yielded by a plot of land can be said to be profit arisen from the land about which I think there can be no dispute, I fail to see why a licence-fee cannot equally be said to be profit arisen from the land. ..\nIt is, however, not necessary for me to pursue this point further and come to a final decision, inasmuch as this case may be decided, as I have already said, on its own special facts. The language of Clause (a) of Section 7(v) is 'the net profits which have arisen from the land... ... during the year next before the date of presenting the plaint.' It is thus clear that in order that the clause may apply, it is necessary that there should be some profit during the year immediately preceding the date on which the plaint was presented. It appears that the plaint in the present suit was filed on 20-6-1950, which may be taken to correspond roughly to Ashar, 1357 B. S. According to the plaintiff's own case, the licence came to an end in Chaitra, 1354 B. S. It is thus clear that between the date on which the licence is said to have, expired and the date on which the plaint was presented, there was an interval of about three years. If that was so, the petitioner was clearly a trespasser on the land and not a licensee during the year prior to the date of the presentation of the plaint and, necessarily there could be no question of the plaintiff having derived any profit from the land by way of a licence fee paid to him during the previous year. It will be obvious that even assuming that licence fee is profit arisen from the land within the meaning of Clause (a) of Section 7(v) of the Court-fees Act, such fee will have to be paid or payable for the year immediately preceding the date on which the plaint is presented. When during the previous year no licence fee wag paid and no amount was claimable as such fee, there was no profit arisen from land and therefore Clause (a) of Section 7(v) would be clearly excluded. This fact, to my mind, is sufficient to dispose of the case and to enable us to hold in favour of the petitioner.\nThe question, therefore, is if Clause (a) of section 7(v) does not apply, what provision of the Act does. It appears to me that the answer is furnished by Clause (b) of the same section. That clause says that if in the opinion of the Court net profits which have arisen from the land during the year next before the date of presenting the plaint are not readily ascertainable or where there are no such profits, the suit should be valued according to the market value of the land. On the facts I have already stated, the present case is one where there were no profits during the year next before the date on which the plaint was presented. The second part of Clause (b) of Section 7(v) is thus attracted and, therefore, the suit ought to be valued according to the market value of the land.\"\n25. (b) . In that case the point arose whether the owner of an immovable property was entitled, on the termination of a licence, to bring a suit against his licensee for a mandatory injunction 'directing him to vacate the property.' The trial Court had decreed the suit. The first' appellate Court reversed the decree, one of the grounds for reversal being that the plaintiff-appellants were not in possession of the disputed property. On second appeal Renupada Mukherjee, J., held:\n\"As a licensee, the respondent has got no interest in the disputed house and his possession cannot therefore exclude the possession of the rightful owners, viz., the appellants, in the eye of law. The appellants came into possession of the disputed house as soon as the licence was revoked before the institution of the suit. It was not necessary for them to bring a suit for possession upon declaration of their title. The learned Appellate Court referred to a case in support of its view that a suit for injunction is not maintainable like the present because the appellants were not in possession at the date of the suit. This case is reported in Bhramar Lal v. Nanda Lal, 18 Cal WN 545: (AIR 1915 Cal 23). But that case is clearly distinguishable on facts from the present case. In the case cited the plaintiffs brought the suit on the footing that the defendants were trespassers. It was, therefore, held that in such a case the plaintiffs could not sue the defendants simply for an injunction but must sue for recovery of the land in suit. In the present case the plaintiffs alleged and established that the defendant-respondent was merely a licensee, That being the case the possession of the house lay with the appellants through the respondent and not with the respondent who had no independent or separate interest in the house. The lower Appellate Court, therefore, committed an error in law in holding that the appellants were out of possession and so they must sue for recovery of possession.\"\nI have now to consider several decisions of some other High Courts, which have some bearing on the point under consideration.\n26. (a) Ram Raj Tiwari v. Girnandan Bhagat, ILR 15 All 63. This was a suit to eject a tenant at fixed rates. Sri John Edge, C. J., 'and Aikman, J., held that such a suit was one for possession of land within the meaning of Section 7(v) of the Court-fees Act 1870, and the valuation of such suit for the purposes of Court-fees and of jurisdiction was the value of the subject-matter of the suit, that is to say of the tenancy right, not of the land itself nor of merely one year's rent.\n27. (b) AIR 1927 Pat 140; ILR 5 Pat 631. In this case the plaintiff filed a suit alleging that she had allowed her daughter and her husband to lives in a house belonging to her but later on revoked the permission. On their refusal to vacate, she brought a suit for declaration of her proprietary interest and recovery of possession. She valued the suit at Rs. 400/-. The trial Court returned the plaint on the ground that the subject-matter of the suit was beyond its pecuniary jurisdiction. An appeal against the order failed. Thereupon, the plaintiff moved the High Court in revision. Kulawaht Sahay, J., (Ross, J., sitting with him) disposed of the Rule with the following observations:\n\"The whole question is whether the suit as framed asks for a declaratory decree and for Consequential relief. In my opinion the suit as framed is a suit for ejectment. The prayer for determination of the plaintiffs title was only incidentally made in the plaint. It is not denied on behalf of the defendant that at the time they entered the house the plaintiff was the owner of the house. They set up a subsequent gift from the plaintiff. The plaintiff denies that she made any gift to the defendants. If the defendants can succeed in proving the oral gift, the suit will certainly be dismissed; but the valuation of the suit is to be determined not upon the plea taken in the, written statement but upon the allegations as made in the plaint. The plaint merely asks for a decree for ejectment of the defendants. The case comes, in my opinion, under Section 7, Clause (v) of the Court-fees Act, and the court-fee payable is according to the market value of the subject-matter of the suit. The subject matter of the suit is the right to eject the defendants and the value of that right is the value at which the defendants' right to remain in the house under the licence of the plaintiff may be valued: See ILR 15 All 63: (1892) All WN 240. The plaintiff valued it at Rs. 400/-. The Court does not say that this valuation is an unreasonable one. The plaintiff, however, has put in a petition for leave to amend the plaint in order to make her position clear. In my opinion she ought to be given an opportunity to amend the plaint.\"\n28. (c) Manikkam Pillai v. Nagasami Ayyar . This was a suit by a landlord to eject the defendants, who occupied a holding under him but had encroached upon part of a bed of a tank. Curgenven, J., held that recovery or possession was an essential element of any suit filed to turn out an encroacher. He further held that a tank-bed had no market value because it was unsaleable except as accessory to some other property. No means existed for ascertaining what, in the event of such a sale, its value would be. Hence it was impossible to apply the provisions of Section 7(v) of the Court-fees Act, because the value of the subject-matter was not determinable. The only course was to assess court-fees under Sch. II, Article 17-B of the Court-fees Act (equivalent to Sch. II, Article 17(vi) of the local amendment applicable to West Bengal).\n29. (d) Sitaramji v. Raghunath Das . In that case the dispute was between two rival Sarbarahkars for their right to manage as Sarbarahkar and the beneficial ownership of the temples was not denied. The deity was deemed to be in possession of land, buildings and gardens as required by Section 7(v) of the Court-fees Act. Ismail and Malik, JJ., (Malik, J., delivering the judgment) held that the value of the subject-matter should not be the value of the property and it being impossible to estimate at money value the subject-matter, Sch. II, Article 17 of the Court-fees Act should apply.\n30. (e) AIR 1947 Bom 482. This was a suit for possession of a house from a defendant, said to be a licensee. Macklin, J., (Bavdekar, J., sitting with him) held that this Court-fee was payable under Section 7(v)(e) of the Court-fees Act according to the market value of the house. His Lordship's reasons are set out below:\n\"The High Court of Patna relies upon a decision of the High Court of Allahabad passed in 1892, before the Court-fees Act was amended so as to make special provision for a suit by a landlord against his tenant for possession of property leased on the basis of the lease: See ILR 15 All 63. Their Lordships agreed unhesitatingly that the case fell within Section 7(v), Court-fees Act, and on the analogy of this case the High Court of Patna also agreed that the case of a licensee suing for possession of immovable property on the basis of the licence also fell under Section 7(v). In each case, as here, the real question of determination was the value of the subject-matter of the suit, and that involves the determination of the subject-matter itself. In the landlord and tenant suit the High Court of Allahabad held that the subject-matter could not be treated as the land itself as the landlord had through his tenants proprietary possession and what was sought in the suit was to free the land from the possession of the tenants holding as tenants at fixed rates, that is to get rid of the tenants and their tenant-rights. Apparently there the Court thought that the subject-matter of the suit was getting rid of the tenants and their tenant-rights. In the licensee case before the Patna High Court the Court thought that the subject-matter of the suit was the right to eject the defendants and the value of that right was the value at which the defendant's right to remain in the house under the licence of the plaintiff might be valued. In neither case did the Court treat the subject-matter as being the property itself, although it was of the property itself that possession was sought. In defence of the order of the lower Court it is argued that this is the correct, way to look at the question, since the subject-matter in a case of this kind ought not to be regarded as the entire house with all the rights involved therein but merely one aspect of the house. But with all respect to the learned Judges who decided the two cases cited, I think that they are entirely wrong. In plain English the subject-matter of a suit is what the suit is about. It is not the same thing as the object of the suit. The object of the suit is the claim, in other words, possession of the house. The subject of the suit is the house. That this is the correct view to take is, I think, clear also from the wording of Section 7(v), itself. The section says that suits for the possession of land, houses or gardens are to be valued according to the subject-matter, and the Sub-section goes on to say that where the subject-matter is land, the value shall be determined according to Clause (a), (b), (c) or (d) and where the subject-matter is a house or garden, the value shall be deemed to be the market value of the house or garden. In other words, the section contemplates the subject-matter of a suit for the possession of land as being the land and the subject-matter of a suit for the possession of a garden as being the garden and the subject-matter of a suit for the possession of a house as being the house, and there is no suggestion to 'be derived from the section itself or, so far as I know, from anywhere else that the subject-matter ought to be taken to be anything else. I can imagine hard cases arising out of this provision; I can imagine cases where paying the Court-fee on the value of a house might in all the circumstances be an unduly heavy price to pay in the event of the suit being lost. But we cannot do anything about that. The law seems to be as I have said; and if the law is harsh, it can always, be amended.\"\n31. (f) Gajanan Nanaji v. Rajeshwar Krishnaji, AIR 1950 Nag 237: ILR 1950 Nag 432. This was a suit for possession of a shop in a market building by a permanent lessee thereof. Bose, C. J., held that such a suit was clearly a suit for possession of a house. Therefore, the subject-matter, so far as possession was concerned, was the house and not the possession of the leasehold right which was intangible and not capable of physical possession. The valuation, therefore, depended on the market value of the house and not on the value of the leasehold rights in it. His Lordship observed:\n\"The learned counsel for the plaintiffs relies on ILR 5 Pat 631: AIR 1927 Pat 140, where the learned Judges have applied Section 7(v), Court-fees Act. But the learned Judges do not state which part of the section applies. Their reasoning is that the subject-matter of the suit in a case like this is not the house but the leasehold rights in it. If that is so, then with the utmost respect I cannot see how Section 7(v) can apply because that is limited to cases where the subject-matter is either a house, garden or land.\n \n Section 7(v) runs: 'In suits for the possession of .........houses ...... according to the value of the\nsubject-matter and such value shall be deemed to be \n \n x x x \n \n \n(e) Where the subject-matter is a house ......\naccording to the market value of the house.' \n \n Therefore, the Court is bound to apply the market value in every case where possession is sought of a house. \n \nNow this suit is clearly for possession of a portion of a house, therefore the subject-matter is, so far as the question of possession is concerned, the house. It docs not matter what the interests in the house consist of because the suit is not for possession of the leasehold rights -- these are intangible and are not capable of physical possession. The tangible physical object of which possession is sought is the house; therefore the subject-matter of the suit, so far as possession is concerned, is the house. With all respect to the learned Patna Judges, I am unable to agree with their reasoning.\"\n32. (g) Martandrao Tatyaji v. Tarabai, AIR 1952 Madh B 123. This was a suit by a husband to recover possession of portion of a house from his first wife, whom he described as his licensee. Mehta, J., held that where the suit was for possession of house from a licensee the Court-fee was payable under Section 7(v)(e) of the Court-fees Act according to the market value of the house. His Lordship followed the cases reported in AIR 1947 Bom 482 and AIR 1949 Cal 621 and dissented from the view expressed in AIR 1927 Fat 140: ILK 5 Pat 631.\n33. (h) Nidugonda Rudramani v. Chaduvula Sri Sailam, . This was also a suit for ejectment of a licensee from a house, on revocation of licence. Chandra Reddy, J., observed that Section 7(xi)(cc) cannot have any application to a suit to recover possession of the property from a licensee, because a licensee is riot a tenant. His Lordship further observed:\n\"Counsel for the petitioners next argued that in any event the case is not governed by Section 7(v)(e) of the Act as the subject-matter in dispute, is not the house itself but something less namely, the right of the defendants to remain in the house. According to him, Section 7(v)(e) of the Act applies only when the suit is based on title and not to a case like the present where the plaintiffs revoke the licence and the dispute in the suit is only the right of the licensee to remain in the house.\nThe basis of the argument is --'AIR 1927 Pat 140'. No doubt the above case lends support to his argument. The learned Judges took the view that a suit for ejectment of a licensee after the revocation of the licence was under Section 7(v), Court-fees Act and the Court-fee payable is according to the market value of the subject-matter of the suit. According to them, the subject-matter of the suit is the right to eject the defendants and the value of that right is the value at which the defendants' right to remain in the house under the licence of the plaintiff may be valued.\nX X X Sub-clause (e) of Clause (v) of Section 7 makes provision for the recovery of possession of garden or house. So a suit for recovery of possession of a house has to be valued under that Sub-clause when once it is found to come under Section 7(v), Court-fees Act.\nNor am I able to appreciate the force of the observation that the subject-matter of the suit is the right of the licensee to remain in the house. If the basis of the suit is the revocation of the licence I do not see what right the licensee has to remain in the house. He is in the position of a trespasser and he has no right to continue in possession of the house.\nIn support of their conclusion the learned Judges relied upon a decision of the Allahabad High Court in ILR 15 All 63. That was a suit to eject a tenant at fixed rate on the allegation that the tenant committed acts inconsistent with the purposes for which the land was let. The question incidentally arose whether the suit should be valued as one for possession of land within the meaning of para 5 of Section 7, Court-fees Act. It was decided that para 5 of Section 7 applied to such a case. It was further observed that: 'the subject-matter cannot be treated as the land itself, as the landlord-plaintiff has through his tenancy, proprietary possession, and what is really sought is to free the land from the possession of the tenants', that is to get rid of the tenants. For the reasons mentioned above I find it difficult to agree with the rule stated therein.\nSection 7(v) is limited to cases where the subject-matter is either a house, garden or land. If possession of any of them is sought, it must be valued as provided for in that section and possession is made for the recovery of possession of house under Sub-clause (e) requiring computation of Court-fees on the basis of the market value.\nA Bench of the Bombay High Court in AIR 1947 Bom 482 expressly dissented from AIR 1927 Pat 140. The view taken by them was that a suit for possession of a house on the allegation that the defendant was in possession as a licensee has to be valued under Section 7(v)(e), Court-fees Act. Repelling the argument that the subject-matter in a case of this kind ought not to be regarded as the entire house with all the rights involved therein but merely one aspect of the house, the learned Judges observed that 'the subject-matter of a suit is what the suit is about. It is not the same thing as the object of the suit'.\nThe same view was taken in a recent case by the Calcutta High Court in AIR 1949 Cal 621. In AIR 1950 Nag 237, Bose, J., expressed his dis-agreement with the principle enunciated in AIR 1927 Pat 140 and reached the same conclusion as the learned Judges in AIR 1947 Bom 482, though there is no reference to that case.\nI express my respectful agreement with the rule stated by the Bombay High Court in AIR 1947 Born 482 and hold that the present case is governed by Section 7(v)(e), Court-fees Act and Court-fee has to be paid on the market value of the house.\"\nThese are all the cases I need refer to in this context.\n34. It appears from the examination of ease law that there are five different lines of opinion on this point, namely,\n(i) The value of the subject-matter of a suit to eject a licensee is the right of the licensee. Even viewed as a suit for recovery of possession, the possession of the licensee is the subject-matter, of the litigation and as such is of lessor value than the value of the property. This is the view to be found in the cases in 24 Cal WN\" 167 (Notes), AIR 1927 Pat 140: ILR 5 Pat 631. The decision in , inclines to this view, though it does not decide the point. ILR 15 All 63 also supports the reasoning behind this view.\n(ii) In a suit for possession from a licensee, Section 7(v) of the Court-fees Act applies and since the subject-matter cannot be valued precisely, the valuation put by the plaintiff must be accepted.\nAlternatively, if it be held to be governed by Section 7(iv)(c) of the Court-fees Act, the plaintiff would be entitled to put his own valuation because no objective standard of valuation is available. This is the view to be found in . . ...\n(iii) In such a suit Court-fee must be paid on the value of the property, which is taken to be the subject-matter. This is the view to be found in Civil Revn. Case No. 880 of 1948 (Cal), Civil Revn. Case No. 233 of 1949 (Cal), AIR 1949 Cal 621, , AIR 1947 Rom 482, AIR 1950 Nag 237, AIR 1952 Madh B 123 and AIR 1954 Mad 20p. The decision in 98 Cal LJ I also inclines to this view.\n(iv) In such a suit the subject-matter of the suit is not the property in respect of which the plaintiff claims relief but the relief itself. The relief is that the licensee should leave the land and structures thereon. The value of this is obviously very, less ordinarily than the value of the property over which the licence, was said to have been given. For the purposes of jurisdiction, the valuation need not be made on the basis of the market value of the property or the capitalised value; of the profits thereof. This is the view we find in the case .\nSen, J., is the strongest critic of this view point and his Lordship's views are to be found in the cases in and Civil Revn. Case No. 1083 of 1958 (Cal).\n(v) The remaining point of view is that in such a suit court-fees must be assessed under Sch. II, Article 17, because the value is indeterminate. This is the view to be found in the cases in and . With this view I do not agree, because in my opinion such suits are covered by Section 7(v) of the Court-fees Act.\n35. From the above analysis it appears that there is a preponderance of judicial opinion in favour of the point of view as in number (iii) referred to above.\n36. It also appears from the review of case law hereinbefore made that the two decisions and (both by Das Gupta, J.,) are not reconcilable, unless it be held that his Lordship confined his observations in the case, , only to valuation of a suit for the purposes of jurisdiction.\n37. The answer to the question before me ought to be sought, in the first place, in what the position of a licensee is, after his licence is revoked. In my opinion a licensee, whose licence has been revoked, becomes a trespasser, just as a tenant, whose tenancy has been determined becomes a trespasser, unless law makes him a statutory tenant. That a licensee becomes a trespasser, after revocation of his licence finds support front the decisions in 98 Cal LJ 1 and Civil Revn. Case No. 233 of 1949 (Cal) (supra), and also from another decision reported in Minister of Health v. Bellotti, 1944 KB 298. In the latter case, to house the defendants and others evacuated from Gibralter, during the last Great War, large blocks of flats, were requisitioned and furnished by the Commissioner of Works and then handed over to the Minister of Health, who granted licences to evacuees to reside in them. Difficulties as to discipline having arisen, letters were sent on behalf of the Minister to the defendants requiring them to leave their rooms together with their dependants, taking all their possessions with them, within one week. Attempts to expel them having failed, the Minister commenced proceedings for damages and injunction. Lord Greene, M. R., held that although the time given to vacate was unreasonable, the letters were valid notices revoking the licences and as, by the time the proceedings were commenced, sufficient time had elapsed for the defendants to vacate their rooms, the Minister, was entitled to injunction restraining the defendants from trespassing in the blocks of flat.\n38. If a licensee, whose licence stands revoked, becomes a trespasser, then a suit for eviction of such a person undoubtedly would be a suit for possession of land, house or garden and must be valued according to the value of the subject-matter under Section 7(v) of the Court-fees Act. Nobody has as yet gone to the length of holding that the subject-matter of a suit for possession against a trespasser is not the property in respect of which the plaintiff claims relief but the relief itself namely, that the trespasser should leave the property. Viewed from this point of view, all difficulties, as to the meaning of the word 'subject-matter' should disappear.\n39. The word 'subject-matter' is used in section 6 of the Civil Procedure Code, which is to the following effect:\n\"Save in so far as is otherwise expressly provided, nothing herein contained shall operate to give any Court any jurisdiction over suits, the amount or the value of the subject-matter of which exceeds the pecuniary limits (if any) of its ordinary jurisdiction.\"\n40. Order 7, Rule 11, C. P. C., inter alia provides:\n\"The plaint shall be rejected in the following cases;\n(a) ..\n(b) where the relief claimed is under-valued, and the plaintiff, on being required by the Court to correct the valuation within a time to be fixed by the Court, fails to do so:\n (c) ... . ........... \n \n (d) .. ... .. .. \n \n \n The words 'value of the subject-matter' in Section 6 and the words Value of the relief in Order 7, Rule 11, Code of Civil Procedure have, in my opinion, been used in identical sense and the value of the subject-matter is, without more, the value of the relief. \n \n41. I have already observed that the subject-matter of a suit for eviction against a licensee, whose licence stands revoked, and who thereupon becomes a trespasser, is the property which is sought to be recovered. That being so, the value of the relief must be the value of the subject-matter, namely, the property and that must be valued, in accordance with Section 7(v) of the Court-fees Act.\n42. It remains for me now to consider whether for the purpose of jurisdiction, such a suit I need be valued differently. That appears to be the view taken in the case . Das Gupta J., emphasised on Section 8 of the Suits Valuation Act, which is to the following effect:\n\"Where in suits other than those referred to in the Court-fees Act, Section 7, paragraphs v, vi and ix and paragraph x, Clause (d), court-fees are payable ad valorem under the Court-fees Act, 1870, the value as determinable for the computation of Court-fees and the value for the purposes of jurisdiction shall be the same.\"\nHis Lordship, therefore, observed that in determining the value of a suit, in which Court-fee was payable under Section 7(v), no assistance was to be had from the Court-fees Act because Section 8 deliberately excluded it from the application of the rule that the value as determinable for the purpose of court-fees and the value for the purposes of jurisdiction shall be the same.\n43. Section 8 of the Suits Valuation Act no doubt excludes Section 7(v) of the Court-fees Act But Section 8 is in Part II, which deals with 'other suits'. Part I of the Suits Valuation Act deals with 'suits relating to lands'. The word 'land' is defined in Section 5 of the Bengal General Clauses Act as follows:\n\"In all Bengal Acts made between the first day of June, 1867 and the commencement of this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context:\n(1) 'land' includes houses and buildings and corporeal hereditaments and tenements of any tenure, unless where there are words to exclude houses and buildings or to restrict the meaning to tenements of some particular tenure;\n(2) ..\nIn the ordinary legal sense, the word 'land' comprehends trees standing on the land and everything else of a fixed and permanent nature thereon. Therefore, in Part I of the Suits Valuation Act, the word 'land' may be taken to include houses, garden lands or gardens.\n44. Section 3 of the Suits Valuation Act, appearing in Part I, is to the following effect :\n\"(1) The 'Government of a Part A State or a Part C State' may make rules for determining the value of land for purposes of jurisdiction in the suits mentioned in, the Court-fees Act, 1870, Section 7, paragraphs (y) and (vi) and paragraph (x), Clause (d).\n(2) The rules may determine the value of any class of land, or of any interest in land in the whole or any part of a local area, and may prescribe different values for different places within the same local area.\"\nNo such rule has, however, as yet been prescribed by the Government.\n45. But, Section 8 of the Suits Valuation Act provides for no guidance as to how a suit for possession against a licensee, whose licence stands determined, shall be valued for the purposes of jurisdiction such suits being governed by Part I of the Suits Valuation Act, which does not include Section 8.\n46. Then again it is difficult to conceive, that the valuation of such a suit for the purpose of jurisdiction shall be other than what is its valuation for, the purpose of Court-fees. The subject-matter being identical for both the purposes, as I have already indicated, the valuation for the purposes of jurisdiction and Court-fees must be the same.\n47. I have now to consider whether there is any difference between revocation of a licence and termination of a licence. The word 'revocation' means the calling back of a thing granted. The word 'termination' or 'determination' means not only premature extinction, but the coming to an end, in any way whatever. A 'termination' or 'determination' may automatically happen because of defluxion of time, agreed upon, or it may be caused in any other way, as for example, determination of a tenancy by a notice to quit. A revocation of a licence and determination of a licence has the same effect, namely the licence comes to an end. The only difference that I can visualise between the use of two expressions is that a revocation has to be caused or made by the person revoking it; termination or, determination may automatically happen and also may be caused or made by the person desirous of termination or determination. But when a suit is brought for possession against a licensee, either on revocation or oh termination of the licence, the suit is, in either case, a suit for eviction of trespasser. They must be valued either for the purposes of Court-fees or for jurisdiction in the same manner.\n48. The view which I take must operate harshly On those who may seek eviction of licensees, on determination of their licences. While a landlord who seeks to evict a tenant, on determination of the tenancy, has to pay a lesser amount of Court-fee, calculated on the basis of Section 7(xi)(cc), an owner shall be required to pay more and larger amount of court-fees, under Section 7(v)(a) of the 'Court-fees Act, if he wants to evict a licensee, namely, \"(a) according to the value of the subject-matter, and such value shall be deemed to be fifteen times the net profits which have arisen from the land, building or garden during the year next before the date of presenting the plaint, or if the Court sees reason to think that such profits have been wrongly estimated, fifteen times such amount as the Court may assess as such profits or according to the market value of the land, building or garden, whichever is lower;\"\nBut I am unable to give relief against such hardship. Law is an objective thing and there it stands, whether it entails any hardship or does not.\n49. In the view that I take, I answer the questions referred to the Special Bench as follows:\n(1) Valuation of a suit for ejectment of a licensee, upon revocation or termination of his licence, either for purpose of Court-fees or for the purpose of jurisdiction shall be made under the provisions of Section 7(v) of the Court-fees Act.\n(2) There is no difference in the manner of such valuation between a case of revocation of licence and a case of termination of licence as distinguished from revocation of licence.\n50. Let the case be now placed before the learned Chief Justice, with the answers given to the questions, for necessary direction.\n51. There will be no order as to costs in this reference.\n52. Mr. Alok Gupta appeared before the Special Division Bench as Amicus Curiae, because there was nobody to represent the opposite party. Government Pleader also did not appear before the Special Bench. I am thankful to Mr. Gupta for the assistance he gave to me in resolving my doubts.\n53. Let a copy of this judgment be forwarded to the Superintendent and Remembrancer of Legal Affairs, Government of West Bengal, so that he may know of our views and take steps under section 3 of the Suits Valuation Act or Section 35 of the Court-fees Act, so as to remove the hardship which the law causes to the litigant public in such matters.\nGuha, J.\n54. I agree.\nP.N. Mookerjee, J.\n55. I agree in the answers, proposed by my Lords. The divergent views have all been carefully collected, neatly analysed and elaborately discussed by my Lord (Banerjee, J.) and I would only refer here to the substance or essence of the matter, which stands as follows:\n56. The licence having ended, -- and that is how these plaints proceed, --be it by revocation or termination otherwise, the licensee has become a trespasser, and the suit against him must, accordingly, be treated on that footing both for purposes of jurisdiction and Court-fee, in the absence, of course, -- which is the admitted and obvious position here, as shown by my Lord, -- of any effective statutory provision to the contrary.\n57. From the above point of view, the true position has been fully discussed and admirably set out by my Lord (Banerjee, J.) and I need only express any respectful concurrence with him on the"

The offending goods can be confiscated and heavy fines and penalties imposed. There are also provisions for arrests and prosecution to deter them from smuggling and commercial frauds-which seriously affect the economy and even society at large when it comes to sensitive goods like drugs, arms and ammunition. The following paras briefly indicate the provisions in law for seizure, confiscation of goods, imposition of penalties by adjudication. Later paras indicate the arrests and prosecution provisions.\nSeizure\nAn officer of Customs can seize any goods, if he has reason to believe that the same are liable to confiscation, under the Customs Act. The proper officer may also seize any document or things that may be relevant to any proceedings under the Custom Act. However, the person from whom these documents are seized is entitled to make copies of the same.\nThe person from whom the goods are seized is issued a show cause notice, usually within six months. However, the Commissioner of Customs, on sufficient cause being shown, can extend the time period for issue of Show cause notice, by a further six months.\nIn case the seized goods are perishable or hazardous in nature or is prone to depreciate in value over time or for reasons of constraints in space, the government can notify these goods and these goods can be disposed off before the conclusion of the proceedings eg. All electronic goods, Currency, Liquors, P&P medicine, Gold, Silver etc.\nConfiscation\nThe word \u2018confiscation\u2019 implies appropriation consequential to seizure. The essence and the concept of confiscation is that after confiscation, the property of the confiscated goods vests with the Central Government.\nThe adjudicating authority makes the decision regarding confiscation of goods. The specific/ different categories of violations under which the import or export goods are liable to confiscation, are enumerated in Section 111 and 113 of the Customs Act. In general, the goods that are attempted to be smuggled into or out of the country, by route other than land routes or is attempted to be cleared by way of misdeclaration in quantity, description or value etc are liable to be confiscated. The import or exported goods are also liable to confiscation if there is an intention to evade Customs duty or to fraudulently avail the benefits available under various export promotion schemes, such as duty drawback, DEPB, 100% EOU etc."

This means that the police have the power to grant bail to you, in case any FIR is registered against you. In case of bailable offence, it is rather your right to get bail. Assuming that she goes to police to lodge an FIR, and police approach you, offer them bail, and you should be saved from arrest. So no need to fear about arrest.\nYou said that the complaint which she would file is false. So as regards the falsity of her report, that should become clear to police during investigation, as a consequence of which police souldn't file charge-sheet in the court. \nBut if this doesn't happen and still police file charge-sheet against you in the court, then you will have to face the trial, and during trial, destroy the prosecution case and to establish your innocence.\nIn case of your acquittal, afterwards, you may file a civil suit for damages for malicious prosecution, and may be for defamation (if that happens because of her false complaint to police), against the complainant. But that is something to be thought much later, and at that stage, you are advised to consult a lawyer after acquittal judgment.\nHope this helps.\nAdv. Nahush S. Khubalkar"

(Paragraph \u2013 17)It is for the plaintiff to decide how and in what manner she should live as she is the best judge ofher requirement. Once it is found that she requires accommodation under the occupation of thedefendant, the decree for eviction must follow. (Paragraph \u2013 20)The West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act does not require an owner / landlord to change and alterthe nature and character of her house. (Paragraph \u2013 17)For the appellant : Mr. S. P. Sarkar,Mr. Utpal Majumder,Mr. Sanjay Bose.For the respondent : Mr. Ushanath Banerjee,Mr. Saptangshu Bose, 2Mr. Aniruddha Chatterjee.The Court: 1. This is an appeal against judgement and decree dated November 23, 1990passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Seventh Court at Alipore in Title Appeal No. 15 of1989 reversing the judgement and decree dated December 12, 1988 passed by the learned Munsif,Second Additional Court at Alipore in Title Suit No. 23 of 1987.2. This appeal arises out of a suit for eviction, inter alia, on the ground of reasonablerequirement.3. The defendant is the appellant before this Court.4. Shearing unnecessary details, the plaintiff, who has been an well-known film and stageartist and the owner of the suit house, filed this suit for recovery of possession of the ground floorflat, inter alia, on the ground that she has been suffering from osteo- arthritis and spondylitis and assuch she needed the suit flat situated in the ground floor as she has been virtually incapable ofclimbing of stairs. On or about January 5, 1980 at the time of rehearsal of a drama, the plaintiff fellfrom the stage to the ground floor of the hall and sustained serious injuries, particularly, in the leftside of her body. She was confined to her bed for some time. After the incident she was unable toclimb stairs without difficulty. As she had regular pains in her legs, she consulted orthopaedicsurgeon, who advised her not to climb stairs. At present, the plaintiff has been occupying the thirdand the fourth floor of the suit building. As she was facing immense difficulty in reaching herpresent accommodation by climbing of stairs, she needed the ground floor suit flat reasonably forher use and occupation.5. The learned trial judge, by the judgement and decree dated December 12, 1988,dismissed the suit holding, inter alia, that the plaintiff was performing as an artist in stages and as 3such it could not be said that she was feeling any short of difficulty in climbing of stairs as allegedby her. The learned judge suggested that a lift could be installed by the plaintiff for reaching herpresent occupation.6. The plaintiff, being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgement and decree passedby the learned trial judge, preferred an appeal in the court of the learned District Judge, District 24Pargnas at Alipore. Eventually, the appeal was transferred to the court of the learned AdditionalDistrict Judge, Seventh Court at Alipore.7. The learned Additional District Judge by the judgement and decree dated November 23,1990, allowed the appeal and consequently, decreed the suit for recovery of khas possession.8. The defendant has filed this second appeal before this Court challenging theaforementioned decree.9. Mr. S. P. Sarkar, learned senior advocate, appearing for the appellant, submits that thestory of illness of the plaintiff is concocted for the purpose of this suit and she procured, being awell-known artiest, tailor-made certificates from the orthopaedic surgeon for the purpose of thissuit. Mr. Sarkar strenuously submits the plaintiff did not give up her profession either as a stageartiest or as a film artist and, therefore, it is clear that the seriousness of her illness is nothing but amyth. Mr. Sarker submits that the learned judge in the lower appellate court erroneously decreedthe suit, relying upon certificates issued by the doctors long after filing of the suit regardless of thefact that she peruses an active career in the stage and in the film with a busy schedule even after heralleged illness. Mr. Sarkar submits that the requirement of the plaintiff is not genuine inasmuch asshe inducts Calcutta Motor Training School, during the pendency of the present suit, at a monthlyrental of Rs. 75/-( Rupees seventy five ) only per month. Mr. Sarkar submits that as the plaintiff did not utilize the available vacant space in the ground floor, it is impossible to believe that therequirement of the plaintiff is genuine.10. The plaintiff deposed as plaintiff\u2019s witness no. 1 in the suit. She stated that in 1980 sheused to perform as an artist in a drama, Amar Kantak. On January 5, 1980, during a rehearsal atNetaji Mancha, she accidentally fell down on the ground from the stage. She sustained heavyinjuries in the left portion of her body. She was treated by doctors including Dr. A. R. Sahu and Dr.Sunil Kumar Thakur. She could not attend her professional calls for about six months. Thereafter,she again joined the profession on the advice of her well-wishers as also for her subsistence. Shewas advised by her attending physician not to climb stairs.11. Dr. Amiya Ranjan Sahu, the plaintiff\u2019s witness no. 6, was a professor and Head of thedepartment of the Radiology, R. G. Kar Government Medical College at Calcutta. Dr. Sahu opinedthat the plaintiff was a patient of osteo-arthritis and spondylitis of lumbo sacral spine.12. Dr. Sunil Thakur, who deposed as the plaintiff\u2019s witness no. 4, possessed the followingqualifications: M.B.B.S., M.S. (General Surgery), M.S. (Orthopaedic Surgery). The certificateissued by the Dr. Thakur was exhibited as exhibit no. 12 in the suit. Dr. Thakur stated that headvised the plaintiff not to do any strenuous work on the knees including climbing of stairs. Hestated that he gave such advice to the plaintiff so that severity of her illness be not increased infuture. Dr. Thakur emphatically suggested that climbing of stairs would aggravate disease of osteoarthritis.13. It was suggested that the certificate issued by the Dr. Thakur was tailor-made and wasmanufactured at the instance of the plaintiff for the purpose of the suit. The learned AdditionalDistrict Judge, in my view, rightly held that there was no justification for Dr. Thakur to colludewith the plaintiff and to issue certificate and prescription falsely. The learned Additional District Judge scanned the evidence of the doctors, that is, plaintiff\u2019s witnesses nos. 4 and 6 and found thatit could not be held that the prescriptions and certificates issued by the doctors were false andmanufactured document created by the plaintiff for this suit.14. From the materials on record, it is clear that the plaintiff is suffering from osteo-arthritisand spondylitis of lumbo sacral spine. The plaintiff categorically deposed that she was facing greathardship in climbing of stairs. Dr. Thakur, a reputed orthopaedic surgeon, advised the plaintiff notto climb stairs and to take rest as far as possible. Dr. Thakur suggested climbing of stairs by theplaintiff would aggravate the disease of the plaintiff.15. The plaintiff is an aged lady. She is a patient of osteo-arthritis and spondylitis of lumbosacral spine. I hold that she is in difficulty in climbing of stairs and as such she needs to stay in theground floor. Her present accommodation in the third and the fourth floor of the building is notconfluent with her health as she needs to climb stairs to reach the third and the fourth floor of thebuilding.16. Mr. Sarkar, learned senior advocate for the appellant, drew my attention that theplaintiff, in spite of her serious illness, did not give her profession either as a stage artist or a filmartist. The plaintiff stated in her evidence that she resumed her profession after about a gap of sixmonths on the advice of her well-wishers and for her subsistence. She is appearing in the stages andin the films for her maintenance. Such continuation of her professional career could not mean thatshe is not suffering from osteo- arthritis and spondylitis, particularly having regard to her age.17. The learned trial judge suggested that the plaintiff could easily instal a lift for reachingher present accommodation in the third and the fourth floor of the building. It is easy to suggestsomebody to instal a lift, but it is not easy to instal a lift. The Courts are to consider the genuinenessof the requirement of the plaintiff on the existing state of affairs. It was not permissible to suggest 6the plaintiff to instal a lift when it is not known wherefrom the fund should come. The court shouldnot give gratuitous advice or indulge in fanciful speculation. The West Bengal Premises TenancyAct does not require an owner \u2013 landlord to change and alter the nature and character of her house.Moreover, the plaintiff cannot be forced to spend a huge sum of the money for installation of a liftto accommodate a ground floor tenant, who has been paying Rs. 285/- ( Rupees two hundred eightyfive ) only as the monthly rent for a self contained flat in a posh locality at Kolkata.18. It is true that the plaintiff inducted a tenant, Calcutta Motor Training School, during thependency of the suit, but such tenancy was created in respect of a garage. There are two garages bythe side of the kitchen of the defendant and Calcutta Motor Training School was inducted in one ofsuch garage. It is not expected, considering the status of the plaintiff, to ask the plaintiff toaccommodate herself in the aforementioned garage.19. The defendant is in occupation of a flat consisting of one bed room, one drawing room,one store-cum-dinning room, one kitchen and some oval shaped covered space. From the report ofthe learned Advocate Commissioner it is clear that such covered space cannot be used as anindependent room. Considering the background of the plaintiff and the accommodation availablewith the defendant in the suit premises, there is no scope to grant a decree for partial eviction.20. I found that the plaintiff is suffering from osteo-arthritis and spondylitis of lumbo sacralspine. She has difficulties in climbing of stairs. Her attending doctors advised her not to climb stairsas climbing of stairs shall aggravate her illness. She is an aged lady. She is reputed and well knownfilm and stage artist. She is entitled to stay in the ground floor of her house. Her desire to stay in theground floor is not a fanciful, but it is a genuine necessity in the present condition of her health.She has no other suitable accommodation. This eviction suit has been instituted on the ground ofreasonable requirement of the plaintiff. The ground has been proved. Therefore, the plaintiff is 7entitled to get a decree for eviction. It was for the plaintiff to decide how and in what manner sheshould live as she is the best judge of her requirement. Once it is found that she requiresaccommodation under the occupation of the defendant, the decree for eviction must follow.21. The findings of fact by the learned judge in the lower appellate court in grating a decreefor eviction on the ground of reasonable requirement are based on materials on record. It is notpossible to up set such findings of fact under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure. I am ofthe view that this appeal involves no substantial question of law requiring interference by this courtin second appeal.22. There the appeal is, therefore, dismissed. The judgement and decree passed by thelearned judge in the lower appellate court are affirmed.23. I, however, direct the parties to bear their respective costs in this appeal.24. Xerox certified copy of this judgement and decree, if applied for, are to be supplied tothe applicants expeditiously.(Subhro Kamal Mukherjee, J.)\n\u00a0\nHope this helps.\nPlease feel free to ask me if you have any other queries.\nRegards"

        "query-text": "Hi All,\r\n\r\nI recently got married on 6th June 2016, in the court (against my and my husband's family). We dated 2.5 years before we took a decision as there were many conflicts between the families. Cutting the long story short, he did tell me that he is having some business setbacks, so for initial 6 months i have to support him financially as we are both independent (to which i agreed). The man i thought I married was my well wisher and my protector, but as soon as we got married, he was a different human being. \r\n\r\ni was paying the rent, bills, my car and his car's emi's, grocery, going out, phone bills (basically everything). One night we both went out and we both had few drinks, but he was a bit over the limit, he dropped me home and asked me to go upstairs whilst he would park his car (please note: my phone battery was dead, and the charger was in the car in my handbag, which he knew and will get it with him on his way back home).  We lived on third floor. After i came back home i waited for him for 15 minutes but he didnt turn up. I then called him from my landline (the ringer doesnt work on the handset), which he replied that he met a friend downstairs and is coming shortly. So i lied down in bed and i dont know when did i fall asleep to wake up to hear shouting and howling outside the door. I quickly ran to open to see he called up my mother (widow) that your daughter is sleeping with a man and not opening the door for past one hour, the landlord was there and so was the maid who lives next door. \r\n\r\nhe came inside once they left and he bashed me so badly by throwing phone on my face for which i had a swollen black eye, he kicked me several times by throwing my on the floor, he then dragged me from my hair from one room to another accusing me of sleeping with someone. \r\n\r\nmy mother rang the police meanwhile and he left straightaway. So he later bribed the cops which he told me later not to arrest him. Also the SHO gave him a warning, as me and my mother thought we wont press any charges till i get back to normal. I had 6 bruises on my body including my black eye. I was traumatized. He apologised to everyone and admitted to his mistake in the police station and also gave in writing that he has lifted hand on me, and will never do it again, and if done again, a serious action should be taken against him.\r\n\r\nso thereafter i came back to my mothers home and called up his mother (who was not in talking terms with me), but I had to tell her what her son did to me. Anyways, he apologised million times to my mum and me and swore that he would never do it again. I thought to give it few days till I make my final decision. So within 10 days I told him that I cant be in this marriage as I am horrified and he cant beat me up so much if he loved me truly. \r\n\r\nThereafter he went home and told everything to his mother, who came to speak to my mother with him and abused my mother so much and made her so much against me. I was at work when him and his mother came at my mums house and humiliated, harassed and abused my mother beyond imagination. \r\n\r\nShe then called my mother the following day that she is with a lawyer and the divorce cannot be filed till the marriage completes one year and then she started abusing my mother again. Is there any possible thing legally that can be done to get an early or out of court divorce, as I am 34 and I as it is married so late, I ll waste another one year through court procedure. Please advise as I feel helpless. Many Thanks for reading my story.",

Therefore you can make a gift deed and transfer this property to your wife. Generally the gift deed is preferred where the transfer is being done between the relatives.Therefore you should go with the gift deed instead of sale deed. If your sister did not raise objection at the time of partition therefore at the later stage she cannot claim any share in the property because she is prevented to do so by the rule of estoppel under section 115 of the Indian Evidence Act."

So the 100 cents, under the law would be divided in to 4 parts equally i.e. your sister, your mother, and you two brother. (Unless there is mutual partition deed, or WILL of your later father).\nIf your sister goes to the court, then she can ask for revocation of sale already made by your brother of his 45 cent, and if you do gift deed or sale (makes no difference) she can also seek revocation of the same. The court, in a given facts of the case, may or may not revoke such deed is different thing, but legally that remedy exist to her. \nAdditionally, whether you do gift deed or sale deed, it make no difference, because first of all you have to pay equal stamp duty on the document, and second it has to be compulsory registered, and gift is as good as conveyance, except that in conveyance consideration passes, and in gift no consideration passes. So either make no difference, as in civil law suit both are vulnerable against other vested rights. \nSo answer to your question is\n1) It make no difference if you do gift or sale deed. \n2) Since sister is not included, she can at any time file law suit and seek her share in the property for the entire 100 cent, whether sold, gifted or otherwise held. \nI am practice in Gujarat High Court. Should you have any query then feel free to ask. \nRegards\nVivek N Mapara"

That Section 53(1) of such Act does not affect any law relating to insolvency only implies that it does not derogate from any law relating to insolvency. There is, therefore, the recognition on the general law of this country for a creditor to regard the transfer of an immovable property by the debtor to be fraudulent in some circumstances.\u201d\nYou may ask your lawyer to refer to Dunlop case at High court of Calcutta.\nHope this information is useful."

        "query-text": "In 2017, I met him on matrimonial website. I was 30+ years and was getting a lot of pressure from family to marry. I wanted to marry a non-smoker and non-drinker and was finding difficult to get such a person. He projected himself as the most innocent man on this planet. He had four sisters and that made me believe that he would understand what marriage means for a woman. He took money from me to get possession of a shop that he had purchased so that he could give the shop on rent and get married to me. He took possession of the shop but in kept delaying the marriage with some or the other reason. In 2010, he disappeared. I tried contacting his mother and sisters but they did not respond. I filed police complaint of cheating. He contacted me and told me that he had went into hiding in some village as he had threat to his life from local goons from whom he had taken money. He married me in the village temple and his friends had taken a video clip of the marriage. He promised to come back to Mumbai soon but continued staying in that village citing reason of local goons still searching for him. Though I had taken my police complain back, the police arrested his mother and produced her in court. For this, he blamed me. I paid all the court charges, his mother made me sign on stamp paper that all my money was returned and I was not married to him. I did everything I could at that time to get his mother out and though she was released on bail the case to quash FIR took another 5-6 months for which I paid. After that he always kept blaming me. After marriage I left my mother's house as I was now expected to live in my husband's house. But he did not come to Mumbai. So I took house on rent and stayed alone. The landlord and brokers used to ask for marriage certificate but whenever I asked him, he made excuse that he had lost his pan-card and driving license and will register the marriage after he comes to Mumbai. Then he said that he had got into a big trouble with the local politician who had trapped him in a false case and he had to pay him money. He used to call me once in 15 days and all other time his phone was switched off because he was afraid of those local goons tracing him. He took a lot of money from me saying that once this problem is solved he will come and stay with me. From 2013 to 2016 he took lakhs and lakhs of money from me. Whenever I spoke about going to police, he taunted me and made me feel guilty about going to police everytime. In May 2016, he came to Mumbai but did not stay with me. He took my car and went to stay with his mother but expected me to give him money to start business as he did not want to do job. I gave money but within a week the money was spent and he did not feel any remorse about it. He took my car saying he could not move openly in Mumbai as the local goons were still searching for him. Also, he said he will start travel business with the car. I had already taken huge loans to give him money and all my salary was going in paying his EMI and when he refused to take up a job and instead sit at his mother's house entire day, I questioned him. But everytime I asked him anything he simply blamed me for giving him tension. After 6 years of staying alone and giving him so much money to enable him come back to Mumbai, he still made me stay alone. He did not make me meet his mother or family. When I asked him for marriage certificate he refused saying that I will file a Dowry case in case I get marriage certificate. He reduced my status from wife to a live-in partner. I found this very disrespectful and was too shock to see 9 years of my trust being broken. In Sep-2016 I got paralysis and I informed him and requested him to come and take me to doctor. But his response was unexpected. He did not come and instead switched off his mobile and since then is not in contact. His refusal to give me marriage certificate, has brought a lot of disrespect to me. And when I got paralysis, his disappearing act hurted me more. Now I realize that he married me in 2010 only to get out of the police case. Later he kept blaming me for the police arresting his mother and all these years he took revenge by abusing me mentally and financially. He also kept taunting me that I married him for his 1 BHK house. Whenever I tried to explain him that the money, investment, house that I spent after him would had anyways got me a bigger house than that, he abused me and my mother. He spoke the most dirty thing about my mother and sister and said that he said it out of anger. I tried to be as good as a wife possible and tried to do all my duties of wife to keep this marriage, but it was always a one-sided effort. I married to give happiness to my mother but instead had to listen to dirty words against my mother from this man. Even during illness, I had to continue job as I could not afford to lose the job as I had to pay EMI of loan taken for him. While I struggled so much, he used to sit and watch porn videos day and night, move around in my car, spend my hard-earned money lavishly. He made me wait 3 years for marriage and then next 6 years to get the basic happiness of living together with husband. He never wanted marriage but he was still on matrimonial website to fool women and take money. Can I file a case of Cruelty and Fraud? How long is the case expected to go on assuming everything that I said is 100% true? How much will the advocate charge for such a case?",

I tried contacting friends and family to get to know his whereabouts as any other alliance that I've received. he was in Kerala and I was in Bangalore. In the two months that I got to know him, he did come to meet me and got his family to meet me too claiming that he was serious about the relationship. But by early December 2017 I broke it off with him as I discovered that neither was he employed, he also had a lot of debt on his head. This was not something that I was agreeing to get into. But more importantly, he expected me to have sexual relationship with him before marriage which I was not consenting to. He used to try and emotionally black mail me into having sex with him every time he would come to meet me in Bangalore. Not able to handle his anger tantrums when I used to say no to it, he would get verbally abusive. Fearing a physical abuse I asked him to leave my place when he had come to visit in December 2017 and that was the end of this less than two month relationship with this man. He tried to get in touch with me and I blocked him in every possible way after I clearly and in explicit manner told him that I don't want to do anything with him. Meanwhile I also managed to get in touch with his ex wife after I broke up with him through sheer coincidence and she confirmed that she filed a divorce from him due to physical and sexual abuse. This reaffirmed my decision of staying away from him forever. He on the other hand started getting new numbers and calling me again and again to try and get back. While I kept blocking him. Scared of how abnoxious his behaviour can get I thought it was safe for me to change my appartment. I incurred a lot of expenses in this process to move and get another place. I was quite comfortable in my old place and it was safe and convenient for me to got to my work place. This moving caused me a great deal of inconvenience, emotionally and financially. I got in touch with his dad over the phone and explained that if I continue to get harrassed by his son, I will have to take the help of the police to get him to stay away. He apologized on his son's behalf and said that he will talk to his son tot ell him to stay away. For a while there was peace after which he again started sending mails to get in touch with me. I did not reply to any of his mails or messages and ignored it hoping it would die down, but it did not. I tried reading up online of how to file a complaint on harassment but I do not have his address which seems to be a requirement to file a complaint online. It's been more than a year and he still tries various ways of contacting me. And I keep blocking him in every avenue. My dad passed away ten years back and I only have my mother and another unmarried sister in my family. This is causing me great deal of stress and I fear for my and my family members safety.",

The court said the amount of maintenance or permanent alimony must be sufficient to ensure that a woman lived with dignity after separating from her husband.\nIts order came on the man's plea challenging a Calcutta high court order directing him to pay her Rs 23,000 per month. Though the apex court said there was nothing amiss in the high court order, it reduced the amount by Rs 3,000 on the ground that the man had remarried and hence needed to provide for his new family.\nHOW TO CALCULATE ALIMONY\nDear Madam,\nMy answers as follows.\n1)what is the max alimony I can claim from him?\nAns: The quantum of maintence must be based of SC judgment which says 25% of salary must be maintenance. Thus it must be calculated as follows\nSalary Rs.2 lakhs per month\n25% comes to Rs.50,000 multiplied by 12 Months = Rs.6 per year.\nIf you live for another 20 years it comes to Rs.6 lakhs multiplied by 20 = Rs. 1crore 20 lakhs. \nYou get total compensation of Rs.1 Crore Rs.20 lakhs. \n2)can I ask for a property?\nAns: You have no right over property but its notional income may be added to the salary .\n========================================================================================\n \nPRAYER\n\t HENCE THE APPLICANT HUMBLY PRAYS \nA)\tto take cognizance for the offence punishable u/s 498A IPC and punish Respondent No.1 to 3 as per law and extend police protection to the deponent,\nB)\tPass orders u/s 19, based upon S.17, granting separate residence for herself and her three children at a monthly rent of Rs. 20,000/- and advance of Rs. 5,00,000/-.\nC)\tPass orders u/s 18, in totality against Respondent No.1 to 3,\nD)\tPass orders u/s 20(i) granting Rs.25,000/- per month as maintenance for applicant and maintenance at the rate of Rs. 5,000/- each per month to her three children.\nE)\tPass orders granting Rs. 5,00,000/- for setting up house hold requirements, in granted residence, to make it livable, as the applicant cannot return to the house of Respondent No.1 as he is residing in the house of respondent No. 3, which is legally prohibited,\nF)\tPass orders granting litigation expenses of Rs.1,00,000/- as the applicant made to wander from pillar to post for getting legal aid to attend the Hon\u2019ble Court, whereas, the Respondent No.1 falsely filed Divorce Petition.\nG)\tThe applicant also filed interim application supported by affidavit u/s 23(1) and (2) of D.V.Act,\nH)\tThat any other order/s, this Hon\u2019ble Court deems fit, to meet the ends of justice, be passed."

Jeth ji told us that they have dinner by 6:30 to 7:30pm(fixed). My brother told them that my sister comes home at 7:00pm from duty and it's not possible for her to prepare dinner at such a time. Jeth ji said \"we have maid in our home to cook dinner and other homely tasks and Jyoti(me) will not have any problem in our home after marriage\". \r\nOne day jaith ji came and asked me my gross salary. Father in law asked me if I had a CPF (Contributory Provident Fund) account mentioned in pay slip. I showed them my pay slip and there was nowhere mentioned about CPF. This way they were able to see my pay slip and asked several questions regarding deductions. I had taken a loan of Rs 4 lakh, 2 years ago ( much before marriage) for some homely task. My in-laws got angry over this loan and said me your brother must repay it. They many times said me \" tumhare bhai ne Hume kuch samaan nhi diya.\r\n I asked my husband that I come home by 6:45 to 7:00 pm and it's difficult for me to cook dinner by 7:30pm. I said him to change their dinner time or have a maid for preparing dinner and I will pay for the maid. My mother in law said \" Tum chahe kitni badi officer kyu nahi ho tumhe ghar ka kaam karna hi padega\". I agree them but problem was not making food but their fixed time. My mother in law pressurized me to quit job many times. I couldn't. I am a government servt. in AIIMS Delhi. I am a laboratory technician and sometimes I have to stay late in the hospital regarding emergencies.\r\nMy job has given me financial strength. My husband works in private sector earning 20,000. If I quit the job not only I will loose financial strength, my husband's income is not sufficient to meet the needs.\r\nHe has severe ego regarding my income and forces me to quit job. I never belittle him on his salary. He is too sensitive, that when even I pay for while buying something in market he yells at me and says \"Don't try to show you earn more than me. I have some fights with him as he doesn't let me do important tasks just because of his ego. He gets angry when my family or friends phones me. My in-laws get resented if I visit my maternal home even for a single day. \r\nMy mother in law says to me \" you fight a lot with my son aur yaha rahna hai to humare tarike se raho ya fir divorce lo\". My husband says he has no advantage from me being his wife so take divorce. Now I am living at my maternal home.\r\nWe held a meeting in my uncle's home to discuss the issues but my in-laws are highly adamant in their demands. Jeth ji threatens regularly my relatives to either bring Jyoti(me) back to in-laws home or take divorce. They don't want to initiate any step by themselves and force us. Jeth ji even tried to defame me by coming my office in AIIMS and tried to convince my office colleagues that this girl and her family is doing wrong to them. \r\nHelp me sir .",

So No need to worry on this front too.\nEven if your wife goes for revision in sessions court, generally a private complainant against an order of acquittal can be exercised only in exceptional case where the interest of public justice require interference for the correction of a manifest illegality or the prevention of a gross miscarriage of justice (Kaptan Singh vs. State of Madhya Pradesh (1997) 4 supreme 211\nSo your wife unless she shows that there is an exceptionally exceptional case and her claim has been ignored by the lower court, she has no chance of getting the acquittal dismissed.\nSo all you need to do is to ensure that the appeal petition fails on the grounds of NOT being an exceptional case.\nHope this information is useful"

        "query-text": "In the night of 24.01.2012, my Father was looted at knife point by 4 looters at Highway No. 8, near Pardi in Gujarat. He was traveling in a rented car which was taken from Vapi through a travel agency. He was looted of all his belongings like gold chain, diamond ring, cash, mobile etc. Later after investigation it was found that the driver of the rented car was involved in this crime. My father had installed an anti theft software in his looted mobile which helped the Police to nab the criminals. \r\nIt has been now more than 5 and a half years of the incident and STILL WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED OUR LOOTED BELONGINGS AND CASH RECOVERED FROM THE LOOTERS, BY THE POLICE. After the arrest of the criminals, we were told by the police that all the looted items and cash were recovered. The victim, My father passed away in 2014. Later, on the advice of local Police station, we hired one lawyer, available in the Pardi(Valsad, Gujarat) Court premise who started processing the documents required to receive the looted items from the Court after we agreed to pay his related fees. He asked me to bring one elderly member from our family in front of Judge so as to get the order passed from the Judge. I followed Lawyer\u2019s direction and bought my late father\u2019s younger brother (my real Uncle) in front of Judge. For this lawyer even took part of the decided fees in advance,. I had paid in cash and have no receipt for the said payment. Later in January 2015, after our continuous follow up, the Lawyer confirmed that related order to receive the loot recovered items have been issued by the Judge. Since then, I have been following up with the said lawyers through phone and some time in person to receive the looted materials. But, the Lawyer keeps giving reasons and excuses to postpone the issue. I work overseas and hence cannot follow up in Person all the time. I try to see the lawyer once in a year during my visit to India, while at the same time keep following up through phone. \r\nI would like to have legal advise on following two issues:\r\ni.\tI want to get the looted items (gold chain, diamond ring, cash, mobile etc.) belonging to my father which was recovered from the looters. As understood from Police, all recovered looted material and cash was deposited in the court.\r\nii.\tConsidering the unprofessional approach and working of the assigned Lawyer(as mentioned above) what can be done against him legally. Is there chance that the looted materials belonging to my fathers have been taken away by the Police and said Lawyer, from the Court without our information.\r\n\r\nAwaiting response from Lawyers of Kanoon.com for above issues.

The total number of share holders is around 30 to 40 with the 4 directors who started the company holding majority of shares (around 60%). Recently i came to know that there are management issues prevailing the company and the managing director has asked other 3 directors to leave and the managing director newly appointed his wife and brother as directors and bought over the shares from the relieving directors. I asked for balance sheet and P&L of the company as shareholder over email, but they are not willing to give and asked me to visit their office to see balance sheet and P&L statement, for which i cannot travel. After which, for my clarification, i downloaded companies' financial statements from MCA and found that in their filling the auditor has made observations that company is in violation of section 185 and Section 197 of companies act. The managing director (majority shareholder) has been drawing a salary of 10 to 12 lakhs per annum while the profit of the company is less than 2 lakhs per annum and now with recent appointment of his wife and brother as directors, he and his family drawing salary way more than profit leaving very little for shareholders. When i asked about these details, managing director does not provide answers and details. Also, they have not called me to any AGM meetings and all the decisions are taken unanimosly by the managing director itself. As a shareholder where how do i impose my rights in the company in this context. Where to complain if i dont get supportive response from the company management.

We scarcely lived together for a total of 6 months, rest of the days she would create an issue and will leave to her mom's place. In 2016 October, she wanted to go home as her mom is not feeling well. So we visited and she urged to stay back, which I agreed. After that, she never came home. It's been 1 year since, I tried to make contact, and she is avoiding it and have been asking for divorce. Even elders from my family visited her place, but no use. I recently came to know that she is posting pictures of herself and someother guy as her boyfriend. Her father is a lawyer. Now, they called us up and said that, this marriage will not work out, so we will get divorced. I agreed. \r\n\r\nNow the issue starts: \r\n\r\nThey say that they will write up the draft and sign it and give us, which we will have to apply in court and get ex-parte decree. They say they are not willing to come to the court as it is a prestigious issue since they are also in the same profession. They are asking for 5 lakhs rupees. They say that they won't mention even the 5 lakhs as alimony. I told them, that either they will have to mention it alimony or come in person to the court and say that they don't want alimony in front of the judge to be recorded. They are not ready to do either. All they say is, they want divorce and they will sign the draft. No mention of alimony. I'm afraid, if I do that, whether in the future they might appeal on it to get alimony. \r\n\r\nCan you please advice, whether should I have to take the draft and file ex-parte or make them appear in court? \r\n\r\nSecondly, is there any way that the ex-parte decree cannot be revoked later? \r\nPlease advice.",

Currently, Truth Labs is operating from its 6 metropolitan offices located in Hyderabad, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore and Kolkata.\n\u00a0\nIn\u00a0A. Sivagnana Pandian vs M. Ravichandran on 23 December, 2010 of Mdras High court it was held that\u00a0\nThe expression that there is no scientific method available anywhere in the country or State, more particularly in the Forensic Science Department for scientific assessment of the age of handwriting to offer opinion is far from acceptance. A careful survey of the above authorities would unveil a fact that settled plans of actions for experiments are very much available and when one steps into such experiments, there is further scope for upswing in the technology. It is bounden duty of the official concerned to follow the procedures.\nIt was even note\u00a0 that\u00a0even anterior to 1964, in a decision rendered by the Supreme Court, in Shashi kumar Banerjee's Case,\u00a0before the trial Court, the expert had stated that the determination of the age could be ascertained definitely by a chemical test. It reveals that even prior to 1964, chemical tests were in application to find out age of ink. Now, the science in this branch has prospered to considerable dimensions and it cannot hereafter be contended that it is not possible to ascertain the age of the ink by scientific method and exact result could not be secured. The scientists/experts should appear before the Courts with opinionated evidence in this regard, on their successful accomplishment of this assignment.\nIn furtherance, it was held that:\n29. Adverting to the facts of the present case, since various scientific avenues are available for finding out the age of the ink in a document, it must be subjected to tests as suggested by various scientists. I follow the ratio in the decisions in Kalyani Baskar's case and T.Nagappa's case above, and direct to refer the disputed document to such examination in order to provide an opportunity to the accused, when a good material is available, to rebut the presumption as per law, by non-destructive method in this regard.(Emphasis supplied).\n30. If the expert concerned considers that such examination would destruct a part of the document or the document itself, they may report the fact before the Court and the Court thereafter shall pass further orders for the proof of the facts on the basis of pleadings and other evidence. Latching the opportunity to the accused in the attempt at the stage of rebutting the presumption under\u00a0Section 118(a)\u00a0and\u00a0139\u00a0of the Negotiable Instruments Act is not at all \"fair trial\". As per the settled law, every opportunity shall be extended to the accused to establish his defence.\n31. In this situation, it is also regarded that it is the view of the Supreme Court that some delay in taking steps for referring the document to the wisdom of the expert cannot be a legal embargo for entertaining the plea."

The main aim of passing this statute is to make it easy for your designated attorney to access your finances and, in that way, take care of your property.\n\nDefinition:According to the \u2018Section: 1A\u2019 of \u201cPOWER OF ATTORNEY ACT, 1882\u201d, \u201cA \u2018Power Of Attorney\u2019 includes any instruments empowering a specified person to act for and in the name of the person executing it\u201d.\n\nMeaning:The term \u2018Power Of Attorney\u2019 is an authority given by an instrument by one person, called as the donor or principal, authorising another person, called donee or agent to act on his behalf. There may be possibility of giving \u2018Power Of Attorney\u2019 by two or more persons jointly to one or more persons. Here a legal authority is given by the principal to the agent which may be broad or limited and an agent can take all necessary decisions i.e. financial, property related matters and all other matters where principal cannot be present to sign or in the case of principal\u2019s illness and disability. A paper signed by principal giving powers to an agent is sometimes itself called a power of attorney. A paper giving a power of attorney should be clear and understandable.\n\nImportance of Power of Attorney: A power of attorney document is an extremely important part of estate planning yet one of the most misunderstood. It is often convenient or even necessary to have someone else act for you as there is advancement in the business and commerce transactions. As many people confuse the power of attorney (POA) with a will (Probate), but these documents are two very different things and have two very different functions. A will comes into effect on the day person die. A POA applies during a person\u2019s lifetime and ceases to apply when he dies. So you actually need both a POA and a will as they complement, and do not overlap, each other. To add a twist to the subject, there are two types of POA: one for property and one for personal care. These two types are completely separate. They deal with different areas of your life and both are required for effective estate planning.\n\nClassification of Attorney:The Power of Attorney can be classified into two categories which includes:\n\nGeneral Power of Attorney:A general power of attorney is one by which an instrument is executed by the principal authorising the agent to do certain acts in general on his behalf. The word \u2018General\u2019 here means that the power must be general regarding the subject matter and not general with regard to powers in respect of a subject matter. If the subject matter is not general but restricted to something either specific or specifically mentioned by the principal while drafting an instrument then it will not constitute a general power of attorney. It is otherwise called as limited power of attorney.\n\nSpecial Power of Attorney:A special power of attorney is one by which a person is appointed by the principal to do some specified act or acts. In this type of power of attorney, an agent conferred with a power to do specific act in a single or specified transactions in the name of the principal.\n\nIII.\u00a0Durable Power of Attorney:\u00a0A Power of Attorney which specifically says otherwise, agent\u2019s power ends if principal become mentally incapacitated. However, a power of attorney may say that it is to remain in effect in the event of future incapacity of the principal. A power of attorney that says this is called a durable power of attorney.\nTo ascertain whether power of attorney is of general or special in nature, the subject matter in respect of which power is conferred Is to be seen accurately. The power of attorney is the unilateral document wherein donor or the principal gives authoritative power to the agent by signing the document and the agent\u2019s sign is not always required.\n\n\nPersons Competent To Execute:A power of attorney can be executed by any person who is competent to enter into a contract. However, the married women can execute powers of attorney even if they are minors. A company while executing power of attorney must make conformity with the \u2018Articles of Association\u2019 and its common seal. A person must be competent to give power to the appointed person so that it will not affect the legality of the instrument/deed of power of attorney.\n\nAuthentication of power of Attorney:As per Indian law, a power of attorney is a legal document that has to be properly framed, using the right legal terminology and setting out the objectives and responsibilities that you wish to authorise the appointee to carry out on your behalf. If a person wants to authorise someone to act as a power of attorney on his behalf, it must be signed and notarised by a certified notary advocate, who is able to declare that you are competent at the time of signing the document to issue the said power of attorney. You will need to show your ID to the notary advocate before he/she is able to certify and issue the document. It must be executed and authenticated by the registrar or sub-registrar of assurances as per the \u2018Registration Act, 1908\u2019.\n\nPresumption About Power of Attorney:A power of attorney is legal written document which has more legal value and the authenticated attorney will be presumed by the court as legal document under \u2018Indian Evidence Act, 1872\u2019. According to the Section: 85 of \u2018Indian Evidence Act, 1872\u2019, which provides that the court shall presume that every document purporting to be a power of attorney, and has to be clearly authenticate and executed before the notary or magistrate. If there is any issue arises concerning to the genuineness of the attorney then proof of its execution can be called for the verification.\n\nLanguage of The Power of Attorney:An instrument of power of attorney must always use the language known to the donor and if the donor is an illiterate person then scribe and identifier should explain all the contents of the document in the language known by the donor and it has to be certified by the donor that he has understood all the contents and then he has to put thumb mark on the document. Lastly the administrative officer will take the oath from the donor stating that he knows all the contents of the document and he knows the identifier. A sign and seal must be put by the administrative officer after complete verification of the document.\n\nOriginal Documents To Be Verified:A power of attorney which is accurately authenticated by the notary or any magistrate, an affidavit has to be filed with all the original documents of the power of attorney authorising an agent to do certain acts. All the documents will be verified by the court and then court will register power of attorney by putting seal and sign. It is very much essential to make the power of attorney valid.\n\nPowers of Attorney by Two or More Persons:A power of attorney may be executed by two or more persons jointly in favour of one or more persons and when there are several persons as attorneys a complete authorisation in letter to be given by one of them for acting severally. A clause should be included while drafting the deed of power of attorney that all the attorneys should act jointly or separately.\n\nDuration of Granted Power:A general power of attorney remains in force unless expressly revoked or determined by the death of either of the party. A special power of attorney will be in force until the specified act is not completed. Duration of the power will depend upon the type of the attorney or there may be a fixed period of power granted by the principal which must be included in the deed.\n\nRevocation of Power of Attorney:A power of attorney may be revoked at any time by the principal or donor by giving a written notice to the agent, unless it is for a particular fixed period. Revocation usually possible when principal dies or becomes insane or becomes bankrupt. The principal himself can revoke power of attorney if the business for which the agent was appointed is over as mutually agreed upon by the principal and agent. In case if principal has named a spouse or registered domestic partner as his agent, his or her authority to act under the power of attorney is automatically terminated in the event of divorce, legal separation or termination of the registered domestic partnership.\n\nRegistration:A power of attorney is not compulsorily registrable unless it creates an interest in any immovable property i.e. charge in favour of donee. Registration of power of attorney is optional In India, where the \u2018Registration Act, 1908\u2019, is in force, the Power of Attorney should be authenticated by a Sub-Registrar only, otherwise it must be properly notarized by the notary especially where in case power to sell land is granted to the agent. If a power of attorney is in respect of an immovable property of value more than Rs100 it must be registered. Registration of power of attorney authenticates the deed of power of attorney.\n\nStamp Duty:A power of attorney is chargeable under Section: 48 of Schedule 1 of the \u2018Indian Stamp Act, 1899\u2019. A stamp duty has to be paid compulsorily by the principal or donor in the jurisdictional registrar\u2019s office.\n\nLegal Powers Which Can Be Granted To The Attorney:Broadly speaking a power of attorney provides an agent \u201call powers that the principal has\u201d to manage the principal\u2019s financial affairs or make health care decisions may be enough for many purposes. An agent may be authorised to:\n To execute all contracts, deeds, bonds, mortgages, notes, checks, drafts, money orders.\n To manage, compromise, settle, and adjust all matters pertaining to real estate.\n\niii. To lease, collect rents, grant, bargain, sell, or borrow and mortgage.\n\n To sell any and all shares of stocks, bonds, or other securities.\n To file, sign all tax returns, insurance forms and any other documents.\n To enter into contacts, and to perform any contract, agreement, writing, or thing to make, sign, execute, and deliver, acknowledge any contract, agreement.\n\nvii. To make health-care decisions for the donor or his minor children.\nviii. To sue on behalf of the principal.\n\n\nQualifications of An Attorney: It is the duty of the Principal to appoint a responsible person as agent who should act with utmost good faith. An attorney is a person who has been appointed by the donor to act on his behalf. An ideal attorney is that who must be willing to act in that capacity and he has to be impartial having integrity. An attorney should be loyal to the donor and should not disclose any confidential matters related to the business.\n\nDuties of The Attorney Holder: An attorney holder is a person who is authorised by donor legally. An attorney must not exceed the authority given under the power of attorney. If the attorney does exceed their authority, he or she may be liable for any damages suffered by the donor or others. The attorney may, however, do all those acts which are authorised, but only by a particular method, if the power of attorney so indicates. If there is a breach of any condition by the attorney then he shall be liable to the donor except in a case where he has acted reasonably. If there is some doubt as to the wording of the power of attorney, a solicitor should always be consulted. The attorney holder must also act towards the donor with the utmost good faith and tell the donor the nature and extent of any interest which may conflict with his or her duty. An attorney may pass on his or her powers and duties to another person but only if authorised to do so by the power of attorney\nOther Related Aspects:\n\nConstruction Rules:The general rule of power of attorney is that it should be strictly construed. Unless an express power is conferred on an agent to enter into contracts of guarantees on behalf of his principal or to execute or negotiate, negotiable instruments for his principal jointly with others. An agent cannot by his acts bind the principal to a larger extent than he is empowered to do under the power of attorney. He cannot be sued or otherwise held responsible for fraud by the agent. If the power does not authorise the agent to carry on a business except with limitations any act done by him in excess of such power will not bind the principal. For example power to dispose of property does not confer a power to mortgage the property. Power to manage immoveable property cannot permit principal\u2019s ornaments which are a moveable proper.\n\nDrafting of Power of Attorney:\u00a0A deed of power of attorney must be construed so as to include all powers necessary for its execution. There is no legal requirement that a power of attorney be prepared or reviewed by a lawyer. However, if important powers are going to be given to an agent, it is wise to get individual legal advice before signing a complicated form. A person who signs a power of attorney without fully understanding what it means, and without considering risks and alternatives, is asking for trouble. So a power of attorney must be drafted carefully and after knowing all its clauses written in the deed document.\n\nRisk Involved In Granting Power of Attorney:With a power of attorney, an agent is often entrusted with important decisions. And the agent may have access to some or all of Principal\u2019s money or other property. If the agent is not trustworthy, serious problems can result. For example, if the agent is dishonest and runs away with Principal\u2019s money, it may be difficult or impossible to get the money back. An agent is not permitted to use principal\u2019s property for his or her own benefit unless he is expressly authorised to do so. Also, a principal will ordinarily be bound by the agent\u2019s acts (even foolish acts) and will be responsible for the agent\u2019s negligence while the agent is acting for the principal. For example, if an agent is authorized to manage your financial affairs and signs a contract to purchase something on your behalf, you will ordinarily have to pay for it, like it or not. It is obviously important to choose a trustworthy agent; if no trustworthy candidate is available, a power of attorney should not serve its purpose.\n\nConclusion:A power of attorney is very essential legal document which can be admitted as a evidence in the court of law whenever there is any breach of trust by the attorney holder. It\u2019s therefore essential that principal has great confidence in his designated attorney. An agents must be someone principal can trust, without reservation, to use his property for him and not for themselves, or anyone else."

Apart from mandatory notice to the respondents, a newspaper notice is also issued. It roughly takes around 6 \u2013 8 months from the date of filing to receive a Succession Certificate. Both District Court and High Court have concurrent jurisdiction and a petition for Succession Certificate can be heard. A petition should contain the relationship of petitioner with the deceased. The time, date, place of death details should also be mentioned in it and attach the death certificate and any other documents as the court may require. When a newspaper notice is given it specifies a time frame within which, if anyone who has objections can do so, usually it will be one and a half month time frame.

        "query-text": "I am a retired person having agricultural land in a village in Gujarat. The neighbouring town is developing extremely fast and lands are being sold at exorbitant prices. There are some builders who use muscle power and browbeat to scare and terrorize farmers and snatch their land at low price. \r\n\r\nA builder has built a residential complex in a land that borders my land. The builder raised the level of his land before building the residential society and created a drain to release effluent water from the society into my agricultural land. This has been ruining my crops from 2013 since he commenced construction. \r\n\r\nSince I live far away, I only came to know very late about this water drainage. When I requested the builder to stop the water drainage into my agricultural land, he issued threats to grab my land, build shelter, and plant a few rogue elements instead of stopping the effluent water. \r\n\r\nI complained to the Village Panchayat, and as a consequence, the builder hired local goons to dump large boulders in front of my land\u2019s entrance gate completely blocking the way into my land. My further insistence to stop the water drain infuriated him to destroy the entrance gate and barbed wire fence. I thought of complaining to the police but the police is hand in glove with the builder.\r\n\r\nI began investigating the ownership of the neighbouring land where the residential society is built. My search has revealed that the land is still showing as agricultural land and the landowner is a farmer from another village according to the revenue records. Further investigation surprised me. The land purchase is benami. The builder has no evidence of his name anywhere in the records and construction. The residential plots are being sold by the builder using the POA of the farmer in whose name the land was purchased.\r\n\r\nI spoke to the farmer who is the benami owner of the land. He clearly said to me that he has nothing to do with the land other than his name used for the purchase of the land. He confirmed the builder is the actual owner of the land and residential complex. I recorded this phone conversation.\r\n\r\nI would like to know the following: \r\n1.\tIs it possible to invoke Prevention of Benami Transactions Act 1988 and Amendment of 2016 in this case?\r\n2.\tIs the audio recording of the phone conversation with the farmer sufficient and admissible with the appropriate authority to prove the benami status of the builder\u2019s property?\r\n3.\tWhat other evidences will I need to prove that the builder\u2019s property is benami?\r\n4.\tWhich authority should I approach to take cognizance of the builder\u2019s benami property?\r\n5.\tDoes the builder\u2019s actions of destroying my land\u2019s entrance gate and barbed wire fencing, and the abuse of my land by continuously releasing dirty drainage water can attract the provisions of The Gujarat Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act, 2020?",

V. Raveendran said that property can be lawfully transferred only through registered sale deeds.\n\"A power of attorney is not an instrument of transfer in regard to any right, title or interest in an immovable property,\" the bench said, after interpreting various provisions of the law concerning property sales. However, the bench said the judgment will not affect \"genuine transactions\" under the GPA.\nThe judgment delivered would have an impact on both freehold and leasehold properties and affect the mode of transfer of property in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) where GPA sales are very common. Even though it can cause some hardship to those who have already purchased property through the GPA, the order will help curb evasion of duties, flow of black money into real estate and also save people from being cheated by unscrupulous owners selling the same property to several people.\nThe apex court said there can be no mutation of property in municipal and revenue records on the basis of such documents. The bench, however, clarified that its order should not be a ground for disturbing mutations already effected by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) or any other authority.\nBut, there is little relief for thousands of people who hold property without mutation as GPA sales can only be treated as existing sale agreements. An application of the order with prospective effect would have protected their interest. The court, though, stressed that it had merely reiterated the well- settled legal position that such transactions cannot be treated as completed transfers.\nThe court could not make the order applicable with prospective effect as it had not laid down any new law. However, it said that those who had already bought property through GPA before its judgment could use the documents to apply for regularisation of allotments and leases by development authorities. \"Nothing prevents affected parties from getting registered deeds of conveyance to complete their title. The said transactions may also be used to obtain specific performance or to defend possession under section 53A of TP (Transfer of Property) Act,\" the court said.\n2) So GPA is not valid document as of now for any further sale deed."

According to the recent statistical data, 225 women from metro cities get married to NRIs every year and out of these around 25 want to end their marriage due to reasons of hiding facts or of deception. This is the reason why it is important for Indians who marry NRIs to have knowledge of laws related to NRI divorce. Many of NRI weddings end in divorce due to the reasons like:\n\nThe NRI spouses inflate their assets like home, high paid job, or vehicle in the foreign country but actually might not be in a position to support a family after marriage.\nThe NRI spouse happens to have another spouse, settled with him abroad.\nThe NRI spouse feels that Indian spouse is not a suitable partner in coping up with him and his advanced lifestyle and hence, seeks divorce on the grounds of incompatibility.\n\nHowever, The Process Needs one to Furnish the Following Information for Completion of Divorce Process:\n\nWhere was one married? India or Abroad\nDoes one have children?\nWill both be able to reach a financial settlement of their possessions?\nWhat is the religion of both the partners?\nWhich country is one based in?\nWhat is his or her nationality?\n\nEven though, there are not many laws to protect the interest of Indians who marry NRIs but due to rise in the number of troubled marriages of NRIs with Indians, the government is introducing NGOs in both India as well as abroad and these shall guide Indian men and women who are married to NRIs and settled abroad. They offer emotional support, counseling, and legal advice in the process of divorce and separation. Another thing to be kept in mind is that even if the divorce is taking place abroad, it would be good to appoint an attorney who is proficient in Indian divorce laws related to NRIs.\nThe Basic Laws Related to NRI Divorce, That One Must be Well Aware of are:\n\nIf both the spouses are settled in USA, or any other foreign country, then they can seek divorce by mutual consent under the foreign marriages divorce laws of that country.\nIf both the spouses are Indians and have been married under Hindu marriage Act 1955, in that case they can seek divorce with mutual consent under section 13-B."

To clarify, if we apply for a mutual divorce in Australia (not exparte), is it valid or not? What would make it valid in India if MCD is not considered valid? \nAns: Foreign court decree\u00a0valid in India\u00a0but if it`s uncontested\u00a0divorce\u00a0and granted ex parte, than not\u00a0valid in India, Remarriage shall be bigamy. Dear, You are free to remarry in\u00a0INDIA\u00a0as you have been\u00a0divorced\u00a0with mutual consent only.\n2) How do I appoint a power of attorney? Can I write a letter nominating a relative? Would this suffice? If not, are there forms that I need to fill out? \nAns: Yes, section 14 of Notaries Act, 1952 empowers the central government to declare that the notarial act done by notaries in other countries shall be recognized for specified purposes. If a person settled outside India and unable to visit India in the near future, he may execute a power of attorney from India through the Indian embassy.\n3) Even though it\u2019s mutual, I\u2019m a little worried if the facts will be twisted by the other party to try to get favourable financial verdicts. Is there a way to agree to this before the hearing? Ans; A Separation Agreement is easy to go solution. Beware, it has its repercussions too! There might be situations where a separation agreement can be used as a ground for cruelty. And Cruelty is in itself a ground for divorce\n4) Lastly, given that exparte divorces can be granted in India, would it be just be easier to let the other side do it in india? This way I could apply for divorce here in Australia. Would save us both a hassle. Are there any downsides in them pursuing a exparte divorce in India? I don\u2019t want any legal repercussions from this, if any. Ans; As you have filed ex-party Divorce petition therefore it might take time to get the injunction of the ex-party divorce as the Opposite Party might get the chance to place his stand too.....it might take some time.."

At the time of filing his income tax returns, the tax payer had claimed a deduction under section 54F of the Income Tax Act (\u2018the Act\u2019) on the ground that the sale proceeds were invested in the acquisition of a residential home in the joint names of himself and his wife. Section 54F of the Act provides that if a tax payer invests the sale proceeds received from the sale of any capital asset for buying a residential property; the long-term capital gains on sale of the property would be exempt.\nIn its observation by the income tax tribunal observed that section 54F being a beneficial provision, enacted for encouraging investment in residential houses should be liberally interpreted to include investment done in the spouse\u2019s name too.\nOn a further appeal with the High Court by the Department, the High Court also agreed to the view adopted by the Tribunal. The High Court noted that the entire purchase consideration was paid only by the assessee and not a single penny was contributed by his wife. It held that a purpose of construction of the legal provisions is to be preferred as against a literal construction. Further, even if the provisions of section 54F are literally constructed, there is nothing in the section to show that the house should be purchased in the name of the tax payer only. The High Court observed that section 54F does not require that the new residential property should be purchased in the name of the tax payer; it merely says that the tax payer should have purchased / constructed a \u2018residential house\u2019.\nYour case falls under the above category, therefore your spouse can claim tax exemption on the above grounds"

Without the liberal interpretation, the object of granting the exemption would get frustrated.\nTherefore it is not mandatory or there is any need that she should be an applicant or co-applicant to the loan to be obtained by the spouse.\nThe exemption under income tax for LTCG has nothing to do with the EMI loan repayment done by you, she will be entitled to exemption as per section 54F.\nRelying on this and other decisions by various judicial authorities, the High Court observed that for the purposes of section 54F, the new residential house need not be purchased by the tax payer in his own name nor is it necessary that it should be purchased exclusively in his name. The High Court further observed that the assessee in the said case has not purchased the new house in the name of a stranger or somebody who is unconnected with him. The same has been purchased only in the name of his wife. The fact that the entire investment for the house has come out of the sale proceeds and that there was no contribution from the assessee\u2019s wife is undisputed. In view of the same, the High Court allowed the exemption from long-term capital gains in favour of the tax payer."

Left my house in April 2014.\r\nWhen she was with me at my house for 4 months she harresed that she will file cases on me in court. Finally filed 498A case on me in September 2014. I was arrested on Sep 19, 2014 and got bail in 6 days and came out. I filed divorce case. She filed DV case. \r\n\r\nOn December 10,2014 Order was issued to pay maintenance before 10th of Every month. They haven't shared account number till January 19,2015.In next hearing our lawyer told to court that we are ready to pay maintenance, however she should co-operate  for case proceedings. she said she is not prepared. After that we applied in high court that maintenance is high on the other hand she gave a petition saying maintenance amount is low. \r\n\r\nAnd then She filed a petition to reject the bail because the passport is not submitted. But when they came to arrest me cops asked for passport and I gave them right away. From then my passport was with them. I told the same in the court. But Cops said it is not with them. But internally when we spoke with cops they said it was with them but they did not submit to court that means it is a issue to them. I don't that I should take a memo when I gave my passport to cops. As I don't have any proof to show that I submitted passport to the cops, with great difficulty I took my passport from cops and submitted to the court. Court warned me by saying that I have to attend all the hearing in person by coming to the court. (Finding difficulty to take leave in office to travel from Bangalore to Hyderabad every time to these hearings)\r\nI am paying maintenance for her every month now. She gave all the false evidence of Jewellary bills and also a document saying her father took loan from his friends and gave to me and my dad.  All these documents of proof which she gave did not include a Number which says it is valid or not. Thats what my lawyer said in court and to me as well and to the Judge also and asked the judge the same they are all duplicates with no exact purchased bills. Now My lawyer demanded for original bills when the jewellery bought.  Wife also kept my CIBIL report.\r\n\r\nMy question is How can a person take the other person CIBIL report by any third party and submit as evidence in the court. In Domestic violence case my wife submitted my CIBIL report in the court as evidence. Can I file different case on theft of my CIBIL report with out my knowledge and shown as evidence in the court?\r\n\r\nTo pay the maintenance fee for her every month which was very huge and I have to do my living with dependencies of my parents the Land which I purchased before marriage with loan on my name I saled it and using that money to pay the maintenance and lawyers fees and so on.. Now by this CIBIL Report she knows that and kept that as evidence I have no idea how this works to the court. Please clarify this. Thanks in advance and your help.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nWanted to know will there be any issues if we don't pay maintenance? \r\nI want to move my divorse Case fast but she is not attending to the hearings and moving this maintence and 498A case fast in such a way that hearings are every alternative day or next day itself. Please helpppp\r\n\r\nAsked 28 days ago in Family Law from United States",

And couple went and didn return to native and saying nice excuses and didn inform anything and directly came to Bangalore where brother is working and me and my mom were already staying . As soon as they came, my mom did Arthi and fed them with milk and banana and went to herroom .. My brother came to   my mom  room and forced us to take her parents bag from ground floor which my mom denied and bro was argueing with us . Suddenly my sister-in-law came to beat us and called police and told police that we beat her so requested police. Police understood the problem and adviced my sister-in-law and her parents that they don have rights to make them to leave the home . From that day onwards  , our home is divided into 2 portions with 2 kitchens and sharing only common kitchen and there is no communication to them .. Bro comes and asks whether we had food. \r\n\r\nThen on Dec23rd , She and her parents fought with bro and left home . Then my brother kept on calling and inviting her to home which she rejected . Then March 10th 2016, she and her relatives came and did her 5th pregnancy ritual in our home without any intervention of us and next day they packed all her things and assualted us (me,my brother and my mom and my dad) and went and filed 498a and section 3/4 DP act . \r\n\r\nStill now there is no communication to her .. Whenever her parents comes and fights with my brother , we had to support brother . \r\n\r\nShe has informed police that my bro should come to her home and there should not be any communication to my family . If my bro doesn accept, file case against family . Since my bro didn agree they filed case on whole family without investigation with us . She filed case on 12th March 2016.\r\n\r\nOn 14th March 2016,  we got FIR copy and accussed list as (A1 - My brother /A2- Me / A3- My mother / A4 - My father) ..\r\n\r\nNow we have applied for bail , lawyer says judge has raised objection .. And probably order will be passed tomo (30th March 2016). \r\n\r\nAnd when we checked in ecourt website using our FIR number , Accused order list has changed in website( A1- Me / A2 - My mother/ A3 - My brother / A4 - My father).\r\n\r\nMe, my brother and his wife are all working in IT company.\r\n\r\nShe has made false allegations like below in FIR (Pasted first few sentences) :\r\n\r\nFrom first day of engagement , my husband family is demanding TV, Villa , more and more jewels . His sister and mother are here and not leaving me to live happily . They are demanding every time . Currently they are asking 4 wheeler and my whole salary\" They took my 21/2 KG silver on first day of marriage and didn even show to me . And my husabnd family is not allowing my husband to talk to her . we didn provide even water and didn allow her to boil milk .\r\n\r\n\r\nOur concern :\r\n1. Since they always attack my brother , eventhough my bro liked his wife lot and lot , he is afraid to live with her . \r\n2. She doesn even like him talking with us generally . \r\n3. She is kind of adamant and eavesdrop our casual talk and over exaggerates to an extent .\r\n4. She has run from our home few times and even if my brother talks with my mom over phone .\r\n5. For everything , she used to threaten my brother that she will file 498a against us .\r\n6.  Now she is not with us and taken all her items except pooja items made up of silver . \r\n7. In honest , she  attacked me and spreaded rumour to house owner  that i kicked her stomach to get sympathy since she is pregnant . \r\n\r\n\r\nMy questions :\r\n\r\n1. Whats the implication of 498a and section 3/4 . Should we prove or sister-in-law has to prove ?\r\n2. How accused order is changed in ecourt website from FIR copy . Will it have impacts ?\r\n3. Since my marriage is abt to be fixed, is there any fastest way to get rid of it ?\r\n4. Why Anticipatory bail is getting delayed ? Raising objection is formality or its specific to cases ?\r\n5. How sister-in-law can prove the allegations .. She may have some audio recording which is captured during fights but there wont be any talk regarding dowry .\r\n6. Since we are from tamil nadu and all fight conversations are in tamil and case is registered in Karnataka . How this will be handled ?\r\n7. I can go ahead with my marriage procedures or is there possiblty of being convicted later which may impact my marriage life ?\r\n8.

State of Bihar, AIR 2005 SC 3123: (2005) 6 SCC 211: JT 2005 (6) SC 356 as follows:\n(i) The powers of the Supreme Court under article 136 of the Constitution are very wide but in criminal appeals the Supreme Court does not interfere with the concurrent findings of the fact save in exceptional circumstances.\n(ii) It is open to the Supreme Court to interfere with the findings of fact given by the High Court if the High Court has acted perversely or otherwise improperly.\n(iii) It is open to the Supreme Court to invoke the power under article 136 only in very exceptional circumstances as and when a question of law of general public importance arises or a decision shocks the conscience of the Court.\n(iv) When the evidence adduced by the prosecution falls short of the test of reliability and acceptability and as such it is highly unsafe to act upon it.\n(v) The appreciation of evidence and finding is vitiated by any error of law of procedure or found contrary to the principles of natural justice, errors of record and misreading of the evidence, or where the conclusions of the High Court are manifestly perverse and unsupportable from the evidence on record.\nTherefore, your case is a fit case for filing a SLP in supreme court as material concealment of facts amounts to fraud being played on the court and such matters are not taken lightly by Higher Court. Material fact would mean material for the purpose of determination of the lis, the logical corollary whereof would be that whether the same was material for grant or denial of the relief, which in the present case is a material fact and caused grave miscarriage of justice to you, therefore, going to Supreme Court will be beneficial for your interests. \nFeel free to call. \nRegards."

My parents were not able to give around half of the things during marriage because of lack of money. Since my marriage , my in laws has been torturing me mentally about things not given to them. Initially my husband used to support me and said that we will buy things from my salary which I was giving slowly.. I gave around 2 laks from my salary as cash and bought household things worth 1 lakh .they were not satisfied and used to torture me for small small things.Even my husband doesnt like their nature and speaks very rarely to them but he wanted me to be ideal bahu and tolerate all their curses and taunts. Initial 8 months I tried but last month they became really abusive and I fought against them. They got really angry as how a bahu can open her mouth. I made my mind of not staying with them but husband didnt agree thinking what society will speak. Somehow he agreed to have separate kitchen from them, but asked me to do all the house works and leave my job. also I should never meet my parents.Husband is very moody and suspects me for small small things says that I am intersted in another man. He abuses me with really bad words on and off depending on his mood.always checks my mobile. For 5 days he locked the main gate and didnt allowed me to go out neither meet my brother or parents and made me to do all house work even when I had high fever.somehow I managed to come back to my parents house and informed my husband that I have come here but still he abused me with whom I slept.I thought he will regret for how he treated me but instead he is still abusive that says that I have left him.it has been one month since I left but still no calls from him only abusive words. I dont want to go back.and want to put case against them for dowry and mental harrasment and want separation. They treat woman as an object with no freedom and I want to teach them a lesson .How strong is my case?",

Vijaykumar (2015) 1 SCC 513, at paragraph-18, this Court has taken the view that...\n\"even while discharging his official duties, if a public servant enters into a criminal conspiracy or indulges in criminal misconduct such misdemeanour on his part is not to be treated as an act in discharge of his official duties and, therefore, provisions of Section 197 of the Code will not be attracted\".\nPublic servants have, in fact, been treated as special category Under Section 197 Code of Criminal Procedure, to protect them from malicious or vexatious prosecution. Such protection from harassment is given in public interest; the same cannot be treated as shield to protect corrupt officials. In Subramanian Swamy v. Manmohan Singh and Anr.(2012) 3 SCC 64, at paragraph-74, it has been held that the provisions dealing with Section 197 Code of Criminal Procedure must be construed in such a manner as to advance the cause of honesty, justice and good governance. To quote:\n74. ...Public servants are treated as a special class of persons enjoying the said protection so that they can perform their duties without fear and favour and without threats of malicious prosecution. However, the said protection against malicious prosecution which was extended in public interest cannot become a shield to protect corrupt officials. These provisions being exceptions to the equality provision of Article 14 are analogous to the provisions of protective discrimination and these protections must be construed very narrowly. These procedural provisions relating to sanction must be construed in such a manner as to advance the causes of honesty and justice and good governance as opposed to escalation of corruption."

How to start the process and what are the main steps ?\n==You have to file a petition before the District court/Family court under section 13-B of Hindu marriage Act. By the time of filing the petition, there should be one year separation between you. One more condition is you should wait for 6 months more from the date of petition. \n2. Do we have to appear in court ?\n==Yes, at least twice, first time at the time of presentation of the petition and second time at the time of filing your evidence and Judgement i.e. after completion of six months period. \n3. How much time does it take from the day of filing ?\n==Six months + two months mics works, total 8 months from the date of petition. \n4. Is there any pre-condition like husband and wife have to stay separate for certain time before the divorce can be filed ?\n==One year separation by the date of filing the petition. \n5. How much alimony will I have to pay and for how long ?\n==Normally, the husband has to pay alimony approximately 1/3 of his salary. But there is a provision of permanent alimony (i.e. one time lumpsum amount). This amount depends upon mutual understanding. Normally it will range between two lakhs to 10 lakhs or even more depending upon the status of the husband. If the wife is employee or education, the permanent alimony will be very less. \n6. How much child support will I have to pay and for how long ?\n==Permanent alimony which is explained in point No.5 includes child maintenance also. \n7. I have a couple of properties, one purchased before marriage and the other after marriage, but both are in my name only. What does the law say regarding properties owned by husband ?\n==In the same court, there will be a Memorandum of understanding, where you can mention about the above properties saying that she has no right on your properties movable or immovable. This is full and final settlement. \n8. What does the law say regarding other assets of husband, like bank accounts, car etc. that are acquired during marriage ?\n==Same as point No.7.\n9. Any other suggestion/advice ?\n==If you want visitation rights of your child, you have to mention the same in the Memorandum of understanding. You can visit/see your child and can spend for one hour or as ordered by the Honble Court. Or If you want custody of child, you have to mention the same in the Memorandum of understanding. \nIf there is dispute regarding child custody and both wife and husband claims custody, a separate case will go in the same court, but however you will get divorce. Untill the final result of the child custody petition, the court temporarily allots the custody to the person who can look welfare of the child and grants visitation rights to the other person."

Will the higher court take the new documentary evidence we have submitted into consideration?\nEvidence is the material on the basis of which the Court can decide the case. Such evidence must be produced before the Court so that it can establish or disprove the point of contention between the parties. The Law of evidence is a very crucial piece of legislation which helps and guides the court in arriving at a conclusion with regard to the existence or non-existence of facts. The rules of evidence are necessary to bring out the truth in every case and the Court should stick to such rules. Basically, the rules of evidence are required to draw a line between relevant and irrelevant facts. \nIn the appeal you can also argue that the accused has a right to adduce the evidence in defence and the courts below have erred in law in denying the right of defence.\nIn a case decided by Supreme court recently in K Anbazhagan Vs, kARNATAKA STATE AND OTHERS, it was observed that The evidence brought on record in entirety has to be scrutinized with care and caution. It is the duty of the Judge to see that justice is appropriately administered, for that is the paramount consideration of a Judge. The said responsibility cannot be abdicated or abandoned or ostracized, even remotely, solely because there might not have been proper assistance by the counsel appearing for the parties. The appellate court is required to weigh the materials, ascribe concrete reasons and the filament of reasoning must logically flow from the requisite analysis of the material on record. The approach cannot be cryptic. It cannot be perverse. The duty of the Judge is to consider the evidence objectively and dispassionately. The\nreasonings in appeal are to be well deliberated. They are to be resolutely expressed. An objective judgment of the evidence reflects the greatness of mind \u2013 sans passion and sans prejudice. The reflective attitude of the Judge must be demonstrable from the judgment itself. A judge must avoid all kind of weakness and vacillation. That is the sole test. That is the litmus test ."

You can also file a complaint under section 498A of the Indian Penal Code, which deals with cruelty by husband or relatives of husband.\nFile an application with the magistrate under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 for obtaining any of the reliefs mentioned above.

This first goal is accomplished through what is known as a \"quiet title\" action, while the second is done through what is often referred to as an \"ejectment action.\"\u00a0\nThis is often called the \u2018quiet title\u2019 action. If you do not want to sell the property, an \u2018ejectment action\u2019 can be taken which means you want the encroacher out of your property. The matter often reaches the court and either your neighbour would be tried for adverse possession or the court may grant him limited use of the property, often called prescriptive easement.\nHow law treats encroachment?\n\u00a0\n\nThe same law applies upon encroachment as that of trespassing on private land. Trespass is an offence under the Section 442 of the Indian Penal Code as well as the Law of Torts.\nTrespass is of three kinds \u2013 of person (when the rightful owner is restricted from doing what he could previously do) , of chattel (when a person disturbs the rightful owner by using the movable property of the owner) and of property or land.\nThe judiciary may decide to pass an order of injunction to either stop or restrain the encroacher. This could be temporary or permanent.\nThe Court may also ask the encroacher to give the damages or in other words compensation for the encroachment. This is calculated on the present value of the land and estimating the proportion of loss caused.\nIf you see an encroachment and want to proceed the legal way, you should approach the court for an order of injunction as per Order 39 (rules 1, 2 and 3) and claim the damages."

They got married in 2015 The situation is me and my wife have lived in Pune since 2009 and for last 1 year are in Australia. We have never visited their house after their marriage as she (the girl) never liked us. For last 2.5 years + we have never spoken to her or called her/texted her on anything, no interference at all (we had and have no reason to do so), yet she has added our name. We are dragged now. My BIL needs to visit the police station to file chargesheet etc. \r\nPlease can you advise:\r\n1. Will there be any impact on my passport renewal (due in June 2018)?\r\n2. If I have to get an India PCC for my wife, self and son (5 years) for my Australian visa, will there be any issues?\r\n3. What should be my next step, should I worry about anything, hire a lawyer and send a POA so that they can apply for me and my wife's anticipatory Bail (if required) or attack or challenge the case, or just wait as I have no involvement and police should understand this etc. \r\n4. Anything that I need to do immediately to safeguard my family and our stay in Australia.\r\n\r\nWe are worried these days as it seems a Bollywood movie is being replayed and we are constantly tensed.\r\n\r\nMany Thanks for your help in advance.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nRahul M",

If when it comes to his evidence, the defendant H were to file an affidavit, but not appear in court for cross-examination by petitioner, what would be the consequence of that? Would his affidavit be considered as evidence presented by him, or would it be rejected outright?\r\n\r\n2. Is it appropriate/acceptable to attach annexures or appendices to the defendant H's affidavit?\r\n\r\n3. Is it appropriate/acceptable to include references to electronic evicence (such as links to media reports) or citations in the defendant H's affidavit?\r\n\r\n4. With his WS, the defendant H submitted copies of emails and other electronic communications between W and the parents of H, as evidence contradicting some of W's claims. However, since then the email accounts of parents of H were hacked and those emails are gone. Would this submitted evidence be accepted by court, if during cross-examination by H/lawyer, W admits that these messages are real and correct?\r\n\r\n5. H intends to make a \"cost of living\" argument. Towards this end, he has gathered electronic evidence comparing cost of living of the cities in question. (a study from a major international newspaper...the study was subsequently quoted in online stories by multiple reputed media outlets abroad, and also by Times of India. Would links and printouts of those links suffice as evidence towards this argument (irrespective of what the court rules on the argument itself)? Or will only a publication of the Govt. of India suffice?",

After some time I have changed my process. But we both were in relationship, things were going good. We have decided to marry with each other. we have included our family. Our family met with each other twice. We fixed the date and venue. On Rokka ceremony, we have exchanged gifts, give money to boy and his family as a shagun, clothes, fruits and sweets all are distributed well. After the function, on night we both fought with each other for some silly reason then after 2 day of function, boy told me that my family has matched the kundli and it is not matching at all, I am very disturbed, my mom is not happy with this relationship. When my parents talk to his family that issue got sort out. But after few days boy got changed, I don't love you, I don't have any feelings and all. When I met with all of them then true picture come out. Boy wants VERNA car, they want marriage in five star hotel, they need gold set for his sisters, gold rings for his father and jiju's. When I said I will not able to fulfill all these demands, they abused me, insulted me. I have convinced many times to boy, but he is not ready to listen anything.\r\nI am not fighting this battle for myself but for all Indian girls who are afraid of getting married or who have suffered dowry and all. Its high time we get up and raise a voice and let Justice happen we are girls not born to suffer but to be loved and have respect.\r\nAlso I have few questions:\r\n1. First of all this is love marriage, he was with me since 1 year, everybody knows about our relationship, he is agreed for marriage then I told to my parents. We did function in restaurant,  give gifts and money to his family and relatives.(Why they did all of this shit? )\r\n\r\n2. His sister told me that \"300 logo ki gathering waley rokkey toot jatey h ye to bas 30-32 logo ka tha\" I mean what to say, if you guys want to break this then why you guys agreed for the function?\r\n\r\n3. Boy wording- I can break the marriage before 1 day, shukar karo ki aesa ni kia. Now what to say he is a boy so he can do anything??? jab mann tha mere saath ghoom rha tha..messages ker ra tha..late night talks..mann hua toh rishta b jod lia..mann hua toh tod b diya for some silly demands??...and I cant do anything???\r\n\r\n4. Mentally I am disturbed a lot, cant even focus on my work. Everybody asking me what happened to you,you are not smiling, you are not concentrating on work. I was so active girl but after this I am totally broke up from inside. Each and everyday 1 question why I am alive. And being a girl is crime anybody can do anything with girl.??\r\n\r\n5. My brother is no more since July 2016, I beg him and his family please atleast now you guys support me, I will try to fulfill, but this time me and family very disturbed we are not in a condition to face my relationship break. We are respectful family and always try to resolve the Hick ups in any relation but that guy and his family are not ready to even listen to a single word.\r\n\r\n6. The matter turned into fire when my mother and sister in law abused me like kangli ladki and all..I mean what to say now how they people are?\r\n\r\n7. I have all his messages, whatsapp chat, call details and all pictures.\r\n\r\nI just want to let them know that marriage is a bond of love and understanding and not dowry.

        "query-text": "Hi I got married on Jul 2007, Wife was a christian and she converted to Islam and we got married in a mosque. We filed an affidavit for her name change and conversion and i currently have the originals of the same and the original mariage certificate issued by the Mosque in Bangalore. Now coming to the problem, we did not consumate the marriage until Nov 2011. She would not allow. Reason she gives is that she's not ready for that now. I was patient. She's verbally abusive. Filthy abuses if we get into an argument. Shouting, yelling, screaming and Swearing. I lived on the hope that once we consumate the marriage things would change. In early 2011 my wife complained of stomach pain. We went and checked and she was diagnosed with an Ovarian cyst which was impending tortion. Meaning a serious one. We had to take multiple MRI's to confirm. The only option the doctors suggested was a surgical removal of the cyst, and since we did not have any kids, they advised us to go for the kid asap, as the removal procedure involved in removing her entire right ovary. with 3 months we consumated our wedding after consulting with few of the leading doctors. She became pregnant in Mar 2012 and we have a baby girl who has just turned 3. Upon knowing that she was pregnant she insisted in going to her mom's house stating that she cant stay alone with me in kochi. I agreed. Her delivery happened in bangalore and i bore all th expences as well. Even after the child was born the abuses continued. It came to an extent that she started abusing me on the streets. Iam fed up. I help her with everything at home. Maid are expensive where we live, hence i helped her in all her chores.Right from washign vessels to cleaning the toilet. Taking care of the child, feeding the child etc., i work in a BPO and sleep for max 3 - 4 hrs a day i didnt mind coz i thought that im doing this for my family, wife and child. No complaints whatsoever and no regrets. But her abusing continued. We lived like a proper husband and wife only for 3 months, meaning we had sexual intercourse only for 3 months in this 8 years. After she was diagnosed that she was pregnant we did not have anything physical. I thought after delivery life would become normal . Nothing changeduntil this min, the last time we had an intercource was in Mar 2012. Her abusing continued,  I warned her that i would go for a divorce if this continues. i warned her multiple times but still continued. I told her that im not able to love her the way i used to love her and ive lost it all. She made a big scene out of it and left home, took the child and went to bangalore. Its been around 7 months now since she's staying seperate with her parents. After she left i called her and asked her to come down to start a new life. she denied stating that she does not want her daughter to have a father like me. The 8 KMS between office and home was my world for the last 8 years. Im totally done with her. I dont want my daughter to grow up seeing me getting abused, i think that will affect her behaviour as well. 2 months After she left home i sent her and the child clothes for Ramzan, she sent it back to me stating that she knows to provide for the child. I asked their family to come and speak to my parents in coimbatore, they refused. We did not go as well. I asked her divorce, she denied. She acknowledges that we both cant live together under the same roof, however she is not willing to give me a divorce. She says live alone, come meet your child and live alone but i will not give a divorce. she also says that she would not allow me to see the child if i go for a divorce and she would bring up the child stating that her father is dead. She even threatend stating that if its going to end in a divorce she would destroy me and everyone in my family. Next month we are planning to go to their house and talk. Im very clear about a divorce. I wanna give Talaq and end this. Please advise on what precautions that i need to take.",

But it does not talk about online gaming.\nKarnataka High Court in Indian Poker Association v. State of Karnataka, the Court ruled that playing skill games like poker in recreational club is permitted and no license is required for the same on 8th October 2013.\nUnder the Constitution, betting and gambling are State subjects under Entry 34 on List II of the Seventh Schedule\nthus individual States do have the power to make their own legislation. To put it simply, the general laws of India concerning gambling apply unless a state specifically sanctions it. So most have sanctioned lotteries, which would otherwise certainly qualify as a game of chance, but they can still be permitted if the law provides it.\nThe States like \"Sikkim\" have licensed online gambling and online poker. It is up and running as well, and features several licensed poker sites, the largest of which is adda52.com which even has a team of sponsored Indian poker pros.\nMost state laws and the central statute exclude \u2018games of skill\u2019 from being categorised as acts of \u2018gambling\u2019. Yet a \u2018game of skill\u2019 had not been defined under these laws. This caused much confusion till the Supreme Court in State of Andhra Pradesh versus K. Satyanarayana (1968) classified Rummy as a skill-based game.\nTill date no other game has explicitly received such a judicial nod. However, a Madras High Court judgment concluding that a \u2018game of skill\u2019, if organised for profit, would still amount to \u2018gambling\u2019. As the appeal from the verdict in the Supreme Court was withdrawn before it could be finally decided, the legality of making a profit on such activities remains inconclusive.\nAs far as \"Maharashtra\" is concerned legal status of these card games is still not clear. \nIn 2012, according to media reports, some senior citizens who were arrested by police under the Bombay Prevention of Gambling Act, 1887 for playing Rummy and Bridge got relief from the Bombay High Court. The group was arrested and charged under the gambling laws despite both rummy and bridge being considered games of skill. The petitioners stated in their plea that they were playing rummy and bridge, which were neither wagering nor gambling under the Gambling Act.\nTherefore, till the clouds of ambiguity remains regarding the \"game of skill and gaming for profit\" its better to stay away from these gaming sites who are organizing these games for profit."

                "response-text": "Govt. Lawyer has no role.He may be he is a friend or relative to in laws. Divorce by Mutual Consent is as the name suggests is when both parties ie; husband and wife comes to a mutual understanding that the marriage be dissolved amicably. It is clear that one of the parties may withdraw their consent at any time before the passing of the decree. The most important requirement for a grant of divorce by mutual consent is free consent of both the parties. In other words, unless there is a complete agreement between husband and wife for the dissolution of the marriage and unless the court is completely satisfied, it cannot grant a decree for divorce by mutual consent.\nThe Conditions required under section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act are as follows:\n(i) Husband and wife have been living separately for a period of one year or more,\n(ii) That they are unable to live together,\n(iii) And that both husband and wife have mutually agreed that the marriage has totally collapsed, hence marriage should be dissolved.\nIn all there are two court appearances in a mutual divorce\n1.\tFirst A joint petition signed by both parties is filed in court. Secondly In the first motion statement of both parties are recorded and then signed on paper before the Honourable Court.\n2.\tThirdly The 6 month period is given for reconciliation, (the honourable court gives a chance to the couple to change their mind)\n3.\tFourthly 6 months after the first motion or at the end of the reconcile period if both parties still don't agree to come together. Then the parties may appear for the second motion for the final hearing.\n4.\tDivorce decree will be granted as the Honourable Court may deem fit.\n(a) A petition is to be presented jointly by the parties to the marriage.\n(b) The parties have been living separately for a period not less than one year. It is doubtful whether it was intended by the legislators that the parties have lived separately by mutual consent or by force of circumstances or situation.\nBut it does not seem necessary for the court to go into that matter provided the condition of separate living under the same roof of matrimonial home or in separate residence by the parties is satisfied. Unless the consent of any of the parties to such petition is vitiated by coercion, fraud or undue influence, the court ought not travel beyond the statutory condition of its jurisdiction.\n(c) The parties have failed for any reason whatsoever to live together. In other' words, no reconciliation or adjustment is possible between them.\n(d) The parties have freely consented to the agreement of dissolution of marriage. \n(e) The parties are at liberty to withdraw the petition. It seems that the petition may be withdrawn even at the instance of one party in course of six months from the date of presentation of the petition. But when a joint motion is taken by the parties after the lapse of six months but before the expiry of eighteen months from the date of presentation of the petition for making inquiry, the unilateral right of a party to withdraw the petition appears to be barred. But in Sureshta Devi v Om Prakash it has been held that a party to a petition for divorce by mutual consent can unilaterally withdraw his or her consent.\nYou should settle all matrimonial disputes amicably and only pay the full amount at the time of second motion by way of DD or RTGS.\nIf she is delaying to give a statement or appear before the court in second time, under such circumstances neither you nor the court can compel her to appear and make a statement."

It takes 6 months for the process to culminate from the date of filing of the petition if all the documents are in order, but the cooling off period can also be waived by the court now. A joint petition has to be filed which has to be preceded by a positive agreement between spouses on all contentious issues such as division of assets, alimony, etc.\n2. The standard practice is to pay some percentage of the finally settled amount before or at the time of first motion and remaining at second motion. \n3. Govt lawyer has no role in this. It is a private dispute of spouses for which they have to engage their own lawyers."

Inspite of that the police who are under undue influence registering false dowry cases. If you do not think otherwise you may disown your son by releasing a newspaper advertisement stating that you have no links with your son and daughter-in-law, whatsoever thus you may save yourself. The recent law is as follows\n=====================================================================================\nNo arrest in dowry cases till charges are verified, says Supreme Court\n\u2026..family welfare committee\nNEW DELHI: Expressing concern over disgruntled wives misusing the anti-dowry law against their husbands and in-laws, the Supreme Court on Thursday directed that no arrest or coercive action should be taken on such complaints without ascertaining the veracity of allegations.\n \nAcknowledging a growing trend among women involved in marital discord to abuse Section 498A of IPC to rope in their husbands' relatives \u2014 including parents, minor children, siblings and grandparents \u2014 in criminal cases, a bench of Justices A K Goel and UU Lalit said it was high time such frivolous cases which violated the human rights of innocent was checked.\nThis is a shift from the dominant judicial conception of women as victims who would silently suffer injustice rather than bring disrepute to their family by taking domestic conflict outside the four walls of the home. Going by the popular portrait, it is only the worst victim of abuse among women who approach the court for redress.\nOn Thursday, the court broke away from the reigning perception to rule that in dowry cases, the account of the alleged victim need not be taken at face value.\nUndercutting the innocence law enforcement agencies had so far assigned to complainants in dowry harassment cases, the Supreme Court on Thursday directed all states to set up family welfare committee (FWC) in each district and tasked them with testing the veracity of every complaint.\n\"It is a matter of serious concern that large number of cases continue to be filed under Section 498A alleging harassment of married women...\nMany such complaints are not bona fide. At the time of filing of the complaint, implications and consequences are not visualised. At times, such complaints lead to uncalled for harassment not only to the accused but also to the complainant. Uncalled for arrest may ruin the chances of settlement,\" the bench said.\n\"We are conscious of the object for which the provision was brought into the statute. At the same time, violation of human rights of innocent cannot be brushed aside,\" it added.\n=======================================================================================\nQ. Can my wife or her family file a false 498a (dowry) case against me? What are the indications that a wife or her family can file 498a? \nA. There are some indicators which are listed at: http://www.geocities.com/gorky_maksim/pages/assessrisk.htm\nQ. Neither I nor any of my relatives demanded or have taken any dowry. Can she still file 498a?\nA. Yes. Any Indian wife and her relative can file 498a on her husband, his parents, sisters, brothers, grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins, wives of brothers, and other relatives. 498a (dowry harassment case) leads to arrest without any verification or investigation. \nQ. I have given a huge amount, say Rs. 5 lacs, to my wife or her parents by cheque. Can she still file 498a? \nA. Yes. No investigation is done before 498a is filed and arrest warrants are issued without investigation. \nQ. My parents never stayed with us. Can she still file 498a against them?\nA. Yes.\nQ. My wife or her family is threatening to file 498a and they are very abusive. What should I do? \nA. Safeguard yourself, your parents and your relatives.\n1) Be very polite in all circumstances. Record all conversations (voice, chat, email, letters, etc.) with those threatening and keep the originals in a safe place. Never produce the originals before anyone, not even before your lawyer. You can buy Olympus W-10 voice recorder, which costs about Rs.4500. You can also buy a telephone recorder.\n2) Write a complaint to your nearest police station, detailing about blackmailing, her false allegations and her unscrupulous behavior. And request in your complaint to make her stop the threats and abuses immediately. \n3) File RCR (Restitution of Conjugal Rights). Remember to include conditions that she should agree on before she starts living with you again. \n4) Collect evidence to prove that you have neither demanded dowry or have taken it anytime.\n5) Collect evidence to prove that she moved out of the bond of marriage for no apparent reason.\n6) If she does not already know, make sure that she does not come to know that any of your family members is an NRI. \n7) Don't remain home during weekends and holidays. Have proofs of where you were. For instance, if you were in a mall, have a credit card transaction in that mall and keep the copy of that transaction. \nMore FAQ's on request."

Commercial Tax Officer trapped to ACB on dt: [deleted] I have been accused of taking money for releasing lorries detain for the offense of incorrect value of the goods for which notices have been issued two days before for collecting tax penalty and other dues.\r\n\r\nIn this context, I submit that my suspension is solely based on the report of ACB, alleging that I was trapped on 11-8-2016, when demanded and accepted Rs.1,00,000/- as bribe for doing official favour.the amount was kept in my car behind back seat without\r\nMy knowledge.\r\n\tIt is a fact that on 9-8-2016, I have checked and found four lorries transporting Granite illegally and without proper documents, therefore I have detained the lorries and issued demand notice to pay an amount of Rs. 1,80,000 towards tax and penalty for transporting the Granite illegally.\r\n\r\nIt may not be an out of place to mention here, that on earlier occasion in January 2016, the defacto complainant was transporting Polished Granite slabs on the strength of bogus dealer, a non-existing firm. He admittedly confessed that duplicate waybills were prepared by morphing, therefore he was, made to pay an amount of Rs. 1,16,000/- towards Tax, Penalty and C.Fee. As the defacto complainant has confessed as having used 80 forged waybills in the name of bogus dealer, a case was registered in Police Station under Section 420, 477(A) and 406 of Indian Penal Code.\r\n\r\nThe defacto complainant is a economic offender who is in the habit of transporting Granite under forged waybills, depriving the Government its legitimate revenues.\r\n\r\nThe statement given by the defacto complainant on earlier ocassions dt: 18-1-2016 are available with me confessing that the present complainant has used bogus waybills in transporting granites and he will not resort to such acts in future along with tax, penalty and c fee paid details are available as proof. The complaint is made with a vengeance.\r\n\r\nSo far charge sheet has not been filed in the court. I would like to be adviced whether i can prefer a Quash petition before Hon`ble court before charge sheet ..what are the merits of my case for in going for Quash proceedings before charge sheet.",

There is no compulsion on the person to give a statement in favor or agaisnt the accused. \nThe impact of this statement can be seen during the trial proceedings only. \n would like to be adviced whether i can prefer a Quash petition before Hon`ble court before charge sheet ..what are the merits of my case for in going for Quash proceedings before charge sheet.\nIn my opinion, it would be advisable to file the quash petition after the charge sheet is filed so that you can prepare defence accordingly to plead the same before high court in the quash petition."

He married me under false premises claiming that he had a job,property, money and vehicles that he did not have. He also stole some of my jewellery and I realized that the gold chain( mangalsutra) that he put on me was also a fake, although he kept claiming it was real. Me and and my family have been going through severe emotional trauma on account of this along with the financial losses incurred.\r\nI have separated from him and declared the intent to not continue this marriage but I need to know all the legal angles to this case.

Numerous complaints have been made to the Society and the owner in this regard.The owner did not pay heed to society requests or resident requests. The private terrace has not been repaired nor any maintenance carried out for past 14 years by the owner. He just kept reassuring that he will do it and did minor patchwork which did not help in stopping the leakage. The extent of leakage is major (terrace covers entire area of two 985 sq feet flats) and the terrace shows obvious signs ie cracks etc of being in need of complete repair/waterproofing.

                "response-text": "Property can be bought and owned jointly by more than one person. There are some legal and financial implications in such a case that need to be taken care of so as to avoid disputes. \n One of the most common reasons for owning property jointly is financial. People pool in funds to buy a property. A common example of this is purchase of property by husband and wife. By clubbing their incomes, they are also eligible for a higher loan amount. The couple having separate sources of income may pool in their resources to buy a home. \n When two or more people buy a property but do not specifically mention the share that each has in the property, a 'tenancy-in-common' is created. All the coowners can use the entire property and every co-owner is deemed to be having an equal share in it. After the death of one of the co-owners, the interest in the house does not pass on to the other co-owners but to the legal heir or a person named in the Will of the deceased, who will then become a 'tenantin-common' with the surviving co-owners. \n In case the property is owned by two or more persons in equal shares, it is referred to as a joint tenancy. In case one of the joint tenants expires, his interest automatically passes on to the surviving joint tenant(s). \n In case a property is jointly owned by two or more persons, the fact should be specifically mentioned in the sale deed. A property can be acquired by two or more persons jointly by pooling in their resources. Unless there is a contract to the contrary between the parties, co-owners will have a share in the property that is proportionate to the funds contributed by them to buy it. \n The names of the co-owners, along with their respective shares of joint ownership or the ownership in the property should be clearly and specifically mentioned. As such, in case of any income from the property or any gains received on the transfer of such a property, the returns can be divided in the respective proportions of ownership. \n Under the Transfer of Property Act, every joint or co-owner has a proprietary right of the entire property. Accordingly, a sale has to be with the consent of all coowners involved. Only in certain cases, the co-owners get exclusive rights to certain parts of the property, which one can transfer. In case of a house, consent has to be sought from all co-owners owning the house. \n A co-owner is entitled to right of possession, use and to dispose off his share in the property if it is clearly stated in the deed. In case a co-owner is deprived of his property, he has a right to be put back in possession. \nIt is to be noted that mere co-ownership of property without reference to any specified extent would imply that the co-owners have equal interests in the property. For any specific, preagreed shares, the details have to specifically be mentioned in the property documents. The sale deed can specify the shares of the coowners - the proportion of ownership among the individuals. \nIn case one wishes to add a co-owner at a later stage he can execute a sale deed. He can sell a portion of the property to the other person and then get the sale deed registered as a co-owner of the property by paying the necessary charges. This will entail payment of stamp duty. \nAlternatively, one can execute a gift deed. He will need to make a gift deed and get it executed on a stamp paper, and register it at the registrar's office. \nIn case of co-ownership, transfer of property is easy as if one of the partners die. The surviving spouse then becomes the sole owner of the house. \nTax benefits \n Both the owners can claim tax benefits. Both can claim deductions of up to Rs 1.50 lakh against the interest paid on the home loan. They can also claim tax benefits of up to Rs 1 lakh against the principal amount repaid under Section 80C. \n If the property is sold, the co-owners will have to pay tax on the capital gains earned by them. Section 54F of the Income Tax Act provides that if a taxpayer invests the sale proceeds received from the sale of any capital asset in buying a residential property, the longterm capital gains on sale of the property will be exempt. In order to claim this exemption, the house should be purchased by the taxpayer. However, it does not stipulate that the house should be purchased in the name of the taxpayer only. Including the spouse's name as co-owner will not impact the exemption granted by the Act"

You can think about dividing the cost and making payments both in advance and throughout the undertaking. It is imperative that these transactions be properly documented with receipts. If both parties are in agreement, Indian law permits staggered payments. As far as possessions go, you should arrange with your spouse for a calm return of her stuff. If you are concerned about safety, you might use a reputable courier to deliver the items to her home while keeping a record of the delivery. Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act, which governs Indian divorce laws, permits divorces by mutual consent. Make sure that every discussion and agreement is recorded in writing. Pay with caution, and make sure the conditions of the settlement agreement are spelled out in detail. Keep records in difficult situations for legal protection. If necessary, think about employing impartial mediators or local law enforcement to ensure safety during in-law meetings.\n\u00a0\nHope this helps you."

        "query-text": "Hi, I got married in Dec 2011. My husband and in-laws put me through extreme emotional, verbal, physical abuse right from the third day of marriage. They had unlimited demands for dowry which could never have been met by my parents. My husband was extremely insecure, ill-tempered guy who was suffering from inferiority complex. He caged me at home. I was not allowed to go out unless accompanied by his family member(s). I was not allowed to work . I am an engineer. He probably suffers from bipolar disorder or some other psychological genetic disorder. His mother was also crazy like him. I have no medical evidence regarding that. I was emotional and thought that maybe a baby could change things. My daughter was born in Oct 2012. The physical, mental emotional torture grew with the passage of time as they had a desire for a male child. My husband was an alcoholic and had substance abuse problem. My in-laws never supported me. My mother-in-law was instrumental in making my life hell. She wanted me to do all house chores though we had helpers in the house. I was not allowed to sleep enough number of hours or to even feed my child. Violence increased and when it started affecting my daughter I decided to leave the house. At that time I was not sure that I would never return. When I left their house, I filed a police complaint stating that I have been suffering due to domestic violence. I have been living away from them since Aug 2013 with no contact. They have not taken any interest in the upbringing of the child. I have been living with my parents outside India. I am filing for my divorce case. However, I want to do it with mutual consent as this family is very nasty. For the safety of self and my child I do not want to involve myself again with this family. I do not want alimony or their jewelry etc. I am doing this for my child's permanent sole/ exclusive physical & legal custody and want to keep her away from any future harm. Is there any section which protects a child post divorce from her vicious father? In the mutual consent petition I want to highlight these issues to safeguard myself if they change their mind. Can I do this or is it immaterial? How can I ensure that he never contacts her in the future to play with her mind? Please advise. Many thanks!",

                "response-text": "Smt. Sureshta Devi v. Om Prakash, (1991) 2 SCC 25, has concluded this issue and the view expressed in the said decision as of now holds the field.\n9) In the case of Sureshta Devi (supra.), Supreme Court took the view: \"\nUnder sub-section (2) the parties are required to make a joint motion not earlier than six months after the date of presentation of the petition and not later than 18 months after the said date. This motion enables the court to proceed with the case in order to satisfy itself about the genuineness of the averments in the petition and also to find out whether the consent was not obtained by force, fraud or undue influence. The court may make such inquiry as it thinks fit including the hearing or examination of the parties for the purpose of satisfying itself whether the averments in the petition are true. If the court is satisfied that the consent of parties was not obtained by force, fraud or undue influence and they have mutually agreed that the marriage should be dissolved, it must pass a decree of divorce.\" On the question of whether one of the parties may withdraw the consent at any time before the actual decree of divorce is passed, this Court held:\n\"13. From the analysis of the section, it will be apparent that the filing of the petition with mutual consent does not authorise the court to make a decree for divorce. There is a period of waiting from 6 to 18 months. This interregnum was obviously intended to give time and opportunity to the parties to reflect on their move and seek advice from relations and friends. In this transitional period one of the parties may have a second thought and change the mind not to proceed with the petition. The spouse may not be a party to the joint motion under sub-section (2). There is nothing in the section which prevents such course. The section does not provide that if there is a change of mind it should not be by one party alone, but by both. The High Courts of Bombay and Delhi have proceeded on the ground that the crucial time for giving mutual consent for divorce is the time of filing the petition and not the time when they subsequently move for divorce decree. This approach appears to be untenable. At the time of the petition by mutual consent, the parties are not unaware that their petition does not by itself snap marital ties. They know that they have to take a further step to snap marital ties. Sub-section (2) of Section 13-B is clear on this point. It provides that \"on the motion of both the parties. ... if the petition is not withdrawn in the meantime, the court shall ... pass a decree of divorce ...\". What is significant in this provision is that there should also be mutual consent when they move the court with a request to pass a decree of divorce. Secondly, the court shall be satisfied about the bona fides and the consent of the parties. If there is no mutual consent at the time of the enquiry, the court gets no jurisdiction to make a decree for divorce. If the view is otherwise, the court could make an enquiry and pass a divorce decree even at the instance of one of the parties and against the consent of the other. Such a decree cannot be regarded as decree by mutual consent.\"\n-"

He cannot be compelled to fight against a person against whom he does not wish to fight and against whom he does not claim any\u00a0 relief. It is discretionary to grant a relief under Order 1 Rule 10(2) C.P.C., In exercising the direction the court will invariably take into\u00a0 account the wishes of the plaintiff before adding a third person as a defendant to his suit. Keeping in view of the above discussed basic principles, where the court finds that addition of the new defendant is absolutely necessary to enable it to adjudicate effectively and completely the matter in controversy between the parties, will it add a person as a defendant even without the consent of the plaintiff.\n\u00a0\nSection 21 of Limitation Act provides that wherever on Institution of a suit a new plaintiff or defendant is substituted or added, the suit shall, as regard him, be deemed to have been instituted when he is so made a party. However, if court is satisfied that omission to include a new plaintiff or defendant was due to mistake made in good faith, it may direct that the suit as regards to such plaintiff or defendant shall be deemed to have been instituted on any earlier date.\n\u00a0\nIn Razia Begum Vs. Anwar Begum reported in AIR 1958 SC 886, the Hon\u2019ble Apex court laid down the following broad principles:\u2013\n\u00a0\u201c(1) That the question of addition of parties under R.10 of O.1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, is generally not one of initial jurisdiction of the Court, but of a judicial discretion which has to be exercised in view of all the facts and circumstances of a particular case; but in some cases, it may raise controversies as to the power of the court, in contradistinction to its inherent jurisdiction, or, in\nother words, of jurisdiction in the limited sense in which it is used in\nS. 115 of the Code;\n\u00a0(2) That in a suit relating to property, in order that a\nperson may be added as a party, he should have a direct interest asdistinguished from a commercial interest, in the subject-matter of\nthe litigation;\n\u00a0(3) Where the subject-matter of a litigation, is a\ndeclaration as regards status or a legal character, the rule of present or direct interest may be relaxed in a suitable case where the court is of the opinion that by adding that party, it would be in a better\nposition effectually and completely to adjudicate upon the\ncontroversy;\n\u00a0(4) The cases contemplated in the last proposition, have to be determined in accordance with the statutory provisions of Ss.42 and 43 of the Specific Relief Act;\n\u00a0(5) In cases covered by those statutory provisions, the court is not bound to grant the declaration prayed for, on a mere admission of the claim by the defendant, if the court has reasons to insist upon a clear proof apart from the admission;\n\u00a0(6) The result of a declaratory decree on the question of status, such as in controversy in the instant case, affects not only the parties actually before the Court, but generations to come, and\nin view of that consideration, the rule of \u2018present interest\u2019, as evolved by case law relating to disputes about property does not\napply with full force; and\n\u00a0(7) The rule laid down in S. 43 of the Specific Relief Act, is not exactly a rule of res judicata.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn\u00a0 Mumbai International Airport vs., Regency\nconvention Centre reported in 2010 (5) ALD (SC) = AIR 2010 SC\n3109 the Hon\u2019ble Apex court gave some illustrations regarding\nexercise of discretion for adding of parties as follows:-\n\u00a0\u201c 1) If a plaintiff makes an application for impleading a person as a defendant on the ground that he is a necessary party,\u00a0\nthe court may implead him having regard to the provisions of Rules 9 and 10(2) of Order I.\n\u00a0If the claim against such a person is barred by limitation, it may refuse to add him as a party and even dismiss the suit for nonjoinder of a necessary party.\n\u00a02) If the owner of a tenanted property enters into an agreement for sale of such property without physical possession, in a suit for specific performance by the purchaser, the tenant would\nnot be a necessary party. But if the suit for specific performance is filed with an additional prayer for delivery of physical possession from the tenant in possession, then the tenant will be a necessary\nparty in so far as the prayer for actual possession.\n\u00a03) If a person makes an application for being impleaded contending that he is a necessary party, and if the court finds that he is a necessary party, it can implead him. If the plaintiff opposes such impleadment, then instead of impleading such a party, who is found to be a necessary party, the court may proceed to dismiss the suit by holding that the applicant was a necessary party and in his\nabsence the plaintiff was not entitled to any relief in the suit.\n\u00a04) If an application is made by a plaintiff for impleading someone as a proper party, subject to limitation, bonfides etc., the court will normally implead him, if he is found to be a proper party.\nOn the other hand, if a non-party makes an application seeking impleadment as a proper party and court finds him to be a proper party, the court may direct his addition as a defendant; but if the\ncourt finds that his addition will alter the nature of the suit or introduce a new cause of action, it may dismiss the application even if he is found to be a proper party, if it does not want to widen the\nscope of the specific performance suit; or the court may direct such applicant to be impleaded as a proper party, either unconditionally\nor subject to terms.\u201c\n\u00a0\nHope this helps"

For example, in the case of Mukesh M. Bhatia v. Govt. of Maharashtra (2006 (4) Bom CR 588), the Bombay High Court held that when a preliminary issue of law arises, the court must first determine that issue before considering the merits of the application.\nIn terms of your second question, I am unable to provide specific case law links without more specific information regarding the issue and the context of the case.

Let's call this POA Mr. POA_Buyer, also Mr POA_Buyer passed away 2 years back and he executed the sale deed on Mr X and Mrs Y's behalf in 2010. Mr. POA_Buyer was the father of Mrs. Y and the father-in-law of Mr X. Unregistered GPA document was notorized in 2009. \r\n\r\nSellers:\r\nBuilder: ABC Corp Ltd\r\nLandowners: 5 individuals\r\nBoth builder and landowners are represented by Power of Attorney: Mr POA_Seller. This POA is registered in the sub-registrar office.\r\n\r\nProperty Transaction Summary:\r\nMr. X Sojer and Mrs. Y Sojer purchased a property from Builder A and the 5 landowners (sellers).\r\nMr X and Mrs Y(buyer) were represented by POA_Buyer and BuidlerA and 5 landowners(sellers) were represented by POA_Seller and the sale deed was executed and registered in the sub-registrar office by these 2 GPAs, effectively transferring property ownership to Mr. X and Mrs. Y from sellers.\r\n\r\nCurrent Issue:\r\n1. Seller's GPA was registered(buillder+landowners), while the buyer's GPA was not(Mr X and Mrs Y). Is it necessary for the GPA of the buyer to also be registered, GPA was only the signing authority, and ownership is in Mr. X and Mrs Y's name only. The new property transfer Mr X and Mrs Y now wants to do without any GPA to a new buyer.\r\n2. Mr. X and Mrs. Y are facing questions from a new buyer regarding the registration of the GPA for Mr. POA_Buyer not being done.\r\n3. Additionally, there is a typographical error in the sale deed, where \"Sojer\" is misspelled as \"Sojar.\"\r\n\r\nSolution: 3 opinions I learned based on the feedback on this case from 3 lawyers, they are follows:\r\n\r\nOpinion1. Registering the correction deed mentioning spelling mistakes and certifying the unregistered buyer GPA in the sale deed from buyer side as valid by Mr X and Mrs Y should solve the concerns and make everything legal. This correction deed can be executed by Mr. X and Mrs Y with the seller's GPA and registered. \r\nOpinion2. The Seller GPA becomes a witness to the new sale deed registration between MrX and MrsY with the new buyer. This protects from all issues that may arise due to an unregistered buyer GPA.\r\n\r\nOpinion 3: This issue has become too complicated and not recommended for new buyers to go ahead as the title to the property is not certain.\r\n\r\nPlease suggest how we can solve this problem for Mr. X and Mr Y and also the new buyer so that new buyer becomes the rightful owner and also not face problems in reselling this property later.",

After the claim is established you can file a claim on property.\nPrior to the child claiming a share of the inheritance, you will have to commence proceedings to have paternity established in court.\nThis is not entirely straightforward. Before the court orders a DNA test to ascertain whether the father really is the child\u2019s biological father, the child will have to submit proof.\nYou will have to demonstrate that there was contact between the mother and father which could have resulted in the child being conceived. Witness statements from the mother, neighbours or friends are considered as means to demonstrate such contact.\nThe courts have nearly always granted claims by illegitimate children. The circumstances in which the child was conceived are no longer of relevance to the court. In the eyes of the law, all that matters is that the man fathered the child."

        "query-text": "Some 11 months back I queried about my then situation on how to get my wife back and also discussed about child custody. Now situation is changed and moved in forward direction as stated. \r\nJust to summarise : \r\nWe got married in Jan 2011 and blessed with baby boy in Dec 2013 but seems like she never liked me and hence I too response in same way. We do not live with parents in Gurgaon but in a rented house in Gurgaon at same place since 2011. After several talk between us, in July 2017, she left her marital home along with our son and her parents to a nearby room hardly 1-2 kms. She is living in a small room-kitchen along with our son. Since then me and parents of both sides approached her to reconciliation but all in a vain.She is working lady and earning upto 80K in a good MNC in Gurgaon. She only allows me to see my son in park near to her home and that too fixed time from 6-7 PM on Saturday only. Since she left I paid her extra 10K and fees of our son every month. I don't want any divorce but parents of both sides and she herself want divorce on mutual consent. I would have agreed on mutual consent divorce but then I think of my son.\r\n\r\nNext present situation :\r\nI filed a RCR(Sec-9) in Lucknow family court on April 2019 and same was received by my wife by May 2019. On 15 June, 2019 I received call from Mahila Police Thana, Sonipat that my wife raised complaints against me under section 498A. This case also include my parents as well. I had 2-3 meetings of mediation at Police Thana, Sonipat but in vain and with no luck. Even ASI is also requesting me to get rid of her. But then I start thinking of my son and his future growth and development. Even ASI knows that all complaint against me are invalid but she has to go as per process which may take much of my time. During my visit to Mahila Thana, I also once discuss with my wife about next consequences if we get divorce and we should re-think and unite for at least for child growth. But she is adamant on her decision. Now ASI send my case for ADR and I am still waiting for court summon for mediation. Once during my visit to Mahila Thana, Sonipat when I was alone my father-in-law told that I should give him Rs.25L otherwise he will ask his lawyer for more litigation against me, which I respectfully denied and said that I am not wrong anywhere. However, in September 2019, my wife should come to Lucknow for case hearing on 27 September 2019 for which I heard from their advocate that they will be present at Lucknow along with her father but not sure about my wife presence. Recently, since no ADR summon is received, me along with my parents met their lawyer and proposed for 15L for which my father in-law did not agree.I request everyone to please guide me again on child visitation conclusion and his welfare for which I am ready to pay as much I can. Another point is that my wife has now changed her address location along with my son. I last met him 2 months back and now no reply on email,phone.",

        "query-text": "I got married in Chennai in Feb 2015 and lived together with my wife till Nov 2015 after which she travelled to Canada for her higher studies. She was supposed to return in Dec 2017 but after going there she said we are not compatible and refused to come back. When we asked her parents in Apr 2017 to ask her to come and atleast finish off the divorce through mutual consent, they asked us to wait till Dec 2017 to change her mind (Her father didn't want divorce whereas her mother turned very abusive and scolded me falsely as impotent). Even after waiting till Dec 2017, she didn't return and moved to USA from Canada. When we asked her father, he still didn't wish for divorce and tried to convince her for which she didn't agree. I told its not necessary to force her and better to split amicably. Then after waiting till Mar 2018, they told she will come in April and finish off the divorce. But in April 2018, she told she has some Visa issues and came in October 2018 and filed divorce. Second hearing was scheduled in April 2019 but she didn't come citing professional reasons (She is a neurology medical resident in New Jersey now). Then they said she will come in May 2019 but again she refused to come. Then in June 2019, they told she cannot come and told we ll finish second hearing in skype. In july 2019, when we tried for skype, judge refused skype hearing and wanted her to come personally. Then we fixed date in Sep 2019. Now, my father in law is threatening us that his daughter is worth Rs.50 lakhs to Rs. 1 crore since she is highly qualified and we have to pay compensation. I am doing my PhD in India and earn less money to pay such a huge amount. Can he convert this mutual consent case to a contested case and file a false case against me? (I have audio recorded the conversations with him in Apr 2018 in which he himself had said that her daughter betrayed me). If he files such a case, will the police harass me and my family by immediately arresting us? My wife's family is financially in a much better position than us, in which case will the court agree to her demand and ask me to pay maintenance or alimony?",

                "response-text": "Dear Client,\nTo understand the scope of powers that the investigating authorities possess to freeze a bank account, one needs to dive into the source of the power itself. This source can be traced to Section 102 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (\u2018CrPC\u2019).\nThe purpose of Section 102 of the CrPC is to secure the property which has been or suspected to be stolen or which has a direct nexus with the commission of a crime from being \u2018disposed of\u2019 or \u2018destroyed\u2019. Such a measure of seizing property including freezing of bank accounts ensures that the court is able to get back the property concerned. Section 102 of the CrPC falls under Chapter VII which deals with the \u2018Processes to Compel the Production of Things\u2019.\nThe most often contravened condition under Section 102 of the CrPC is the requirement to apprise the Magistrate of the seizure of the property. Section 102(3) of the CrPC clearly mandates that \u201c[e]very police officer acting under sub-section (1)shall forthwith report the seizure\u00a0to the Magistrate having jurisdiction\u201d. The violation of this mandatory condition is what often allows the courts to direct the de-freezing of bank accounts.\n\u00a0\nThank You."

If not under which section case should be fought . In Old Partnership deed there is no clause which says business can be carried over by other partners in such eventuality. However it says disputes among partners shall be solved under arbitration act as per indian partnership act.\nWhen a partner dies, subject to any contract to the contrary, partnership is dissolved. Section 42 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 (\u201cAct\u201d) provides for dissolution of partnership on occurrence of certain contingencies which includes \u2018death of the partner\u2019 as one of those contingencies.\n However, in cases where the terms of the partnership deed are silent on continuation of partnership\u2019s business, a contract to continue the partnership after the death of a partner may be implied from the conduct of the parties. This means that where it is evident that such an intention was present, the nominee or legal representative of the deceased partner can take the place of deceased partner and business of the firm can be continued with the presumption that the partnership was never dissolved on the death of that partner. The above legal position is based on two assumptions- (a) there are more than two partners in the firm, and (b) the legal representatives are interested in taking forward the business of the firm.\nSection 42(c) of the Partnership Act can appropriately be applied to a\u2019 partnership where there are more than two partners. If one of them dies, the firm is dissolved; but if there is a contract to the contrary, the surviving partners will continue the firm.\nYou can sue the present firm on the basis of the illegal dissolution of the previous firm and fraudulently acquiring the assets of the previous firm and getting annexed to this new firm either before CLB or NCLAT."

Similarly the view of the High Court that the compromise required registration was also wrong in view of the clear fact that the mutation petition filed before the Assistant Commissioner did not embody the terms of the family arrangement but was merely in the nature of a memorandum meant for the information of the Court. The High Court further erred in law in not giving effect to the doctrine of estoppel which, is always applied whenever any party to the valid family settlement tries to assail it. The High Court further erred in not considering the fact that even if the family arrangement was not registered it could be used for a collateral purpose, namely, for the purpose, of showing the nature and character of possession of the parties in pursuance of the family settlement and also for the purpose of applying the Rule of estoppel which flowed from the conduct of the parties who having taken benefit under the settlement keep their mouths shut for full seven years and later try to resile from the settlement.\""

It was a contested divorce and she was awarded 3 years of alimony (marriage length was 7 years), apart from a one-time settlement money, by the US court. According to the divorce settlement, I still have to pay her maintenance till April 2017. Now she relocated to India a few weeks back and filed a new divorce case in India and is asking the Indian court to award her continued maintenance. I was served the papers both in the US and at my Indian address (where my parents live). She is saying that she doesn't work and hence she needs continued maintenance. Since she can not get maintenance here in the US beyond April 2017, she is trying to extract more money from me in India.\r\n\r\nNow, my job assignment in the US is getting over in December this year and so I will most probably have be go back to my India office at the end of this year. So I am very concerned about my situation when I go back to India. Will I be considered as married in India again ? Will the court ask me to continue to pay her maintenance ? What should I do to foil her tactics of extracting more money from me and make sure she can't trouble me in India.",

Still on a work permit and not a permanent resident of US. My wife has been abusing me verbally, mentally and physically. I initiated a discussion to let her know that I will initiate a divorce if she is willing for a mutual divorce and if she wants to contest then i can prove all the abuses through the voice and video recordings I have. She threatened that if i initiate divorce process in US she will go to India before the process is concluded in US and will file charges against me in India. She has told that she will drag me to India and ensure my career is ruined. I'm directionless at this point and have very few options now.\r\n\r\nThe only defensive option is to call cops. I can call 911 and complain about her physical abuse and she will be arrested for sure. Since we are in a foreign land, I do not want to see her in a foreign jail but she is not leaving me with any other options. She may be released after few days or weeks from jail. After she is released, she will go back to India and start filing charges against me. My questions are:\r\n\r\n1) How can I protect myself if she goes back to India and files charges against me after her release in US?\r\n2) Will her arrest and the police report from US favor me in India in anyway?\r\n3) Is it possible for her to file any sort of charges that will force or deport me from US?\r\n4) On other forums I'm being advised that me and my parents could end up in jail if a case is started in India. I have not asked her for any money or things neither have I abused her physically or verbally. How can she prove any allegations against me?\r\n\r\nThanks for your suggestion in advance!!",

Citing the reason majority of the properties are in Sivaganga district, we were advised to file the petition in Sivaganga District court and therefore we were told only Succession Certificate can be granted by District court. We are now in the receipt of Succession certificate order after 2 years. \r\n\r\nWe have one of our property in Malaysia which is in legal contention. This property is stated in The Will however is not stated in Succession Certificate for jurisdiction reasons. Besides, all the legal heirs have given consent to the executors to proceed as per the Will. Regardless of this, the Malaysian Advocate is insisting to have a Probate of the Will or Probate of the Succession Certificate from Madras High Court as that is the acceptable legal document for Malaysia for obtaining a resealing order. \r\n\r\nNow since 2 years passed and legal matter with Malaysia is pending for long time, we are running out of time on various perspectives. So requesting your advise if there is a way to obtain Probate on the Succession Certificate issued by District court. Or how Succession Certificate can itself be made a legal document in Malaysia for consideration. And what other provisions can be taken into consideration. Any advise in this regard is highly appreciated.",

This defendant's appeal is directed against the judgment of the Family Court dated 01.11.2013 passed in CS No.13/2010. The impugned judgment decreed the husband's suit for declaration and permanent injunction in respect of flat Nos.H-2/21 & H-2/21D, First Floor, Mahavir Enclave, New Delhi - 110 045, which is hereby referred to as \"suit property\".\n2. The brief facts are that the parties to the suit solemnized their marriage on 12.05.1999. Two children, i.e., a boy and a girl were born out of the wedlock. The suit property was purchased through a sale deed executed on 06.12.2006, which reflected the appellant as owner of the property. The parties started living separately in 2010;\nMAT.APP.(F.C.) 7/2014 Page 1 eventually their marriage was dissolved by mutual consent under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act by order dated 05.07.2014. The husband (hereafter referred to as \"the plaintiff\") filed a suit claiming to be real and true owner of the suit property.\n3. The suit contended inter alia that since parties were living in a rented accommodation in Dwarka, in 2006, the husband purchased the suit property in the name of the appellant wife \"out of love and affection\". The suit also leveled certain allegations of matrimonial misbehavior against the wife, i.e., intimacy with one Rajnish Thakur, owner of the chartered bus, which the wife used for travelling to her office. It was alleged that the wife left the matrimonial home of her own accord after quarrelling with the plaintiff and later she attempted to sell the property. The appellant in the written statement objected to the maintainability of the suit and alleged that the husband plaintiff has concealed the facts. She asserted that she paid the consideration for the suit property and she was discharging the liability towards monthly installment payments for clearing the loan liability. She also alleged that the husband forced her out of the matrimonial home. The written statement even attributed acts of forgery to the plaintiff.\n4. In support of the suit claim, the plaintiff led his evidence including the oral testimonies of three other witnesses. This included the testimonies of PW-2 and PW-3 who were bank officials and who brought the certified copies of statement of accounts for the period 01.10.2006 to 31.03.2013. Likewise the defendant relied upon the testimonies of three witnesses which included the evidence of DW-2 from State Bank of India which had produced the bank statement for the period 01.06.2006 - 31.07.2007 (Ex.DW-2/3) and the bank MAT.APP.(F.C.) 7/2014 Page 2 account statement for the period 01.05.2006 - 31.07.2006 (Ex.DW- 2/4).\n5. The first issue framed by the Family Court was whether the plaintiff proved that he was owner of the property. While considering this, the Family Court took into account the provisions of the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 (hereafter referred to as \"Benami Act\") and the judgments of the Supreme Court reported asNand Kishore Mehra v. Sushila Mehra, AIR 1995 SC 215; Jaydal Poddar v. Mst. Bibi Hazra, AIR 1974 SC 171; Gapadibai v. State of Madhya Pradesh (1980) 2 SCC 327. The impugned judgment after noticing the relevant provisions specially Section 3 of the Benami Act as well as the ruling in Nand Kishore Mehra(supra) held that the onus to prove that the property was not for the benefit of the wife was upon the plaintiff/husband and that he was yet to prove it strictly. The Family Court thereafter observed as follows: -\n\"32. In the present case, it is not in dispute that the parties were married according to Hindu Customs and Rites on 12-05- 99 and they have resided together till [deleted].The suit property has been purchased on [deleted] from its erstwhile owner. It is not in dispute that the Sale Deed had been executed in the name of the defendant. DW-4 was a witness to the registered Sale Deed and he has also deposed about the Sale Deed being executed in the name of the defendant without any force, pressure or coercion and he having signed the same in the presence of the Sub Registrar and the parties as a witness. It is further deposed by him that the Demand Draft for a sum of Rs.9 lakhs drawn on Central Bank of India, Janakpuri was also given at the time of execution of the Sale Deed.\n33. The plaintiff, in his plaint had alleged that he had executed the Sale Deed in the name of the defendant out of love and affection as they were having a relationship as husband MAT.APP.(F.C.) 7/2014 Page 3 and wife. In his testimony as PW-1, he has clarified that the Sale Deed was registered in the name of the wife purely because the Stamp Duty was less if the property was registered in the name of the lady. The testimony of the plaintiff on this aspect has not been challenged by the defendant either in her written statement or at the stage of evidence. The sole defence that has been put forth by the defendant is that the sale consideration for the flat had been paid by her.\n34. The plaintiff has explained in his testimony as PW-1 that the cost of the flat was Rs.15 lakhs and out of the Rs.15 lakhs, he had to pay Rs.10 lakhs by the end of December and remaining Rs.10 lakhs were to be paid after taking loan from the bank. There was no schedule for making payment of Rs.5 lakhs but they were to be paid by December, 2001. It was further deposed by him that he could not pay the entire amount of Rs.5 lakhs till December, 2006 but he took a personal loan of Rs.3,50,000/- from Syndicate Bank to pay the part consideration towards the cost of the flat. The remaining Rs.1,50,000/- was paid by him in the year 2007-08 as he had good relations and understanding with the builder. Whether the entire consideration amount vis-a-vis the builder was paid in 2006 or 2007 as little significance having regard to the fact that the Sale Deed was duly executed in the year 2006 and the possession of the flat was taken by the parties. It is evident from the testimony of the parties that the motive of giving this transaction a benami colour was to pay the stamp duty which can be done legitimately by having the property registered in the name of the wife.\"\n6. It was also held by the Family Court that the intention of the parties was relevant and that the materials on record did not establish that the husband wished that the property was to belong to the wife. As regards consideration it was held that even though the loan was obtained jointly, it was for the reason that the sale deed was executed in favour of the wife. After considering the materials on record, i.e., Ex.PW-2/1, PW-3/1 and PW-3/2, it was held that the husband alone MAT.APP.(F.C.) 7/2014 Page 4 repaid the loan and that the wife at no stage made any payments to discharge the liability for payment of consideration to acquire the suit property. With respect to the defendant's evidence it was noticed that she had secured a personal loan of Rs.1,96,000/- but there was nothing to show that any amount was used to discharge the liability on account of the flat. It was also noticed that the appellant wife had admitted that the entire loan was for the purchase of the flat and the plaintiff was repaying the loan advanced by the bank.\n7. In the light of these considerations, the Trial Court held as follows: -\n\"42. Even if the plaintiff had been able to establish that he had purchased the flat for himself though in the name of his wife the defendant could have still succeeded in defeating the ownership claim of the plaintiff if she could have established that the property had been purchased for her benefit. Neither this plea had been taken nor any evidence has been led in this regard by the defendant. The conduct of the parties also does not establish that the flat had been purchased by the plaintiff for the benefit of the defendant/wife.\n43. The plaintiff has therefore, been able to successfully establish from the nature of the transaction and the surrounding circumstance that he is the actual owner of the suit property that had been purchased benami in the name of the plaintiff.\"\nIn view of the above findings, the Court decreed the suit and held that the plaintiff husband was the real and true owner and was entitled to the injunctive relief claimed.\n8. It is urged on behalf of the appellant by Mr. Gaurav Mitra that the Trial Court fell into error in not appreciating that the husband did not discharge the onus cast upon him to prove that the suit property MAT.APP.(F.C.) 7/2014 Page 5 was not acquired for the benefit of the wife. It is submitted that a fair reading of Section 3 of the Benami Act would show that in the first instance property acquired in the name of the wife is not deemed to be benami property [Section 3 (2)] but - yet there is a statutory presumption in law that the property is for the benefit of wife. The expression \"unless the contrary is proved\" clearly places the onus of proving that this property was acquired not for the benefit of wife, upon the husband. It was urged that nowhere in the suit the plaintiff urged that the property though in the name of the wife was not for her benefit. Counsel emphasized repeatedly that the husband stated that the property was acquired in 2006 \"out of love and affection\" for the wife.\n9. Learned counsel relied upon the observations and ruling in Nand Kishore Mehra (supra) specially the following portion of the judgment: -\n\"Further, we find it difficult to hold that a person permitted to purchase a property in the name of his wife or unmarried daughter under sub-section (2) of Section 3 notwithstanding the prohibition to enter into a benami transaction contained in sub-\nsection (1) of Section 3 cannot enforce his rights arising therefrom, for to hold so would amount to holding that the Statute which allows creation of rights by a benami transaction also prohibits the enforcement of such rights, a contradiction which can never be attributed to a Statute. If that be so, there can be no valid reason to deny to a person, enforcement of his rights validly acquired even in the cast by purchase of property in the name of his wife or unmarried daughter, by making applicable the prohibition contained in respect of filing of suits or taking up of defences imposed in respect of benami transactions in general by sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 4 of the Act. But, it has to be made clear that when a suit is filed or defence is taken in respect of such benami transaction MAT.APP.(F.C.) 7/2014 Page 6 involving purchase of property by any person in the name of his wife or unmarried daughter, he cannot succeed in such suit or defence unless he proves that the property although purchased in the name of his wife or unmarried daughter, the same had not been purchased for the benefit of either the wife or the unmarried daughter, as the case may be, because of the statutory presumption contained in sub-section (2) of Section 3 that unless a contrary is proved that the purchase of property by the person in the name of his wife or his unmarried daughter, as the case may be, was for her benefit.\"\n10. Learned counsel also urged that the Section 3 (2) was carefully worded. In that the requirement of proving that the property was acquired for the benefit is in the past tense. In other words, the use of the terms \"had been purchased for the benefit of wife\" in Section 3underlines that it is at the time of purchase or acquisition of the property that the intention is material and not thereafter. It was submitted that in the present case the pleadings and the evidence clearly point to husband's intention that the property was to belong to the wife and, therefore, was for her benefit. The mere change of such intention subsequently, according to the counsel, would not detract from the initial presumption or displace the onus to prove that from inception property was not purchased for the benefit of wife. It was, therefore, urged that mere fact that the husband paid installments towards discharging a loan liability in respect of the consideration paid for purchase of the property was not a sufficient indicator of the lack of intention on his part that the wife should own the property. Learned counsel also relied upon the judgment reported as Harihar Prasad Singh and Ors. v. Balmiki Prasad Singh and Ors. (1975) 1 SCC 212 and Prakash Rattan Lal v. Mankey Ram, ILR 2010 (3) Delhi MAT.APP.(F.C.) 7/2014 Page 7\n315.\n11. It is argued on behalf of the husband that at no stage did the wife claim that the property was bought for her benefit. She had alleged that she paid all the consideration for acquisition of the suit property. She generally traversed and denied the averments in the suit. It was highlighted that the evidence placed on the record was with an attempt to prove that in fact the consideration was paid. It was next highlighted that though not clearly pleaded, the tenor of the suit was categorical in that the plaintiff urged that the property was purchased not only for the wife's benefit but also for the benefit of the entire family. The evidence also showed that the parties lived together with their children. In fact even as on date the plaintiff and his children live with him - it is only the appellant wife who left the family. Counsel reiterated that till date the loan liability towards payment of consideration for purchase of the property has not been discharged and the husband continues to bear it.\n12. It was submitted that there cannot be general assumption that where parties live together in a matrimonial home and there is no property owned by either of them, the purchase of premises in the name of the wife, has to necessarily be for her benefit. It was suggested that the circumstances of every case have to be examined to see whether the parties intended that the property is for the benefit of the wife exclusively or for the family as a whole. If a fair inference can be drawn that the property is for the benefit of the family, the husband is deemed to have discharged the onus cast on him. Learned counsel has relied upon Valliammal Vs. Subramaniam & Ors., (2004) 7 SCC 233; G. Mahalingappa Vs. G.M. Savitha (2005) 6 SCC 441;\nMAT.APP.(F.C.) 7/2014 Page 8 and V. Shankaranarayana Rao & Ors. Vs. Leelavathi & Ors. (2007) 10 SCC 732.\nAnalysis and Findings\n13. The relevant provisions of the Benami Act, read as follows:\n\"3. Prohibition of benami transactions.- (1) No person shall enter into any benami transction.\n(2) Nothing in sub-section (1) shall apply to-\n(a) the purchase of property by any person in the name of his wife or unmarried daughter and it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that the said property had been purchased for the benefit of the wife or the unmarried daughter;\n(b) the securities held by a-\n(i) depository as registered owner under sub-section (1) of section 10 of the Depositories Act, 1996\n(ii) participant as an agent of a depository. Explanation- The expressions \"depository\" and \"Participants shall have the meanings respectively assigned to them in clauses (e) and (g) of sub-section (1) of section 2 of the Depositories Act, 1996.\n(3) Whoever enters into any benami transaction shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine or with both.\n(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), an offence under this section shall be non- cognizable and bailable.\nIn terms of Section 4(1) no suit shall lie in respect of any property held benami against the person in whose name the property is held or against any other person by or on behalf of a person claiming to be the real owner of such property. Further, there cannot be any suit in respect of a property held benami against a person in whose name such property is held or any other person, if such proceeding is initiated by or on behalf of a person claiming to be the real owner thereof, prior to the coming into force of Section 4(1). Section 4 (2) MAT.APP.(F.C.) 7/2014 Page 9 bars a claim or defence permitting the \"real owner\" of such property and has been held from saying that the property is benami.\n14. The limited controversy, in the opinion of the court, arising in this appeal is whether the plaintiff proved that he was the owner of the property and overcame the presumption cast by Section 3 (2) with respect to purchase of the property inuring to his benefit, rather than to the benefit of his wife, the appellant. The appellant/wife is right in contending that what is not pleaded cannot be proved and no amount of evidence can be considered unless there is a background in the pleadings. Reliance was placed on Hemant Satti vs Mohan Satti & Ors (CS (OS) 824 of 2010 decided on [deleted]).The court had indicated in that case, that the plaintiff has to prove and discharge his onus, by first pleading it.\n15. The \"normal\" evidence rule is somewhat suspended in the case of proceedings before the Family Court. Section 14 of the governing statute, i.e., the Family Courts Act, 1984, prescribes that:\n\"14. Application of Indian Evidence Act, 1872.-A Family Court may receive as evidence any report, statement, documents, information or matter that may, in its opinion, assist it to deal effectually with a dispute, whether or not the same would be otherwise relevant or admissible under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (1 of 1872).\"\nIt is clear that the strict rules of evidence have been dispensed with in respect of proceedings before the Family Court. Whilst the general rule of pleading, as noticed earlier, undoubtedly is that no evidence can be received or appreciated, unless it is pleaded, yet the Courts have explained that the rule itself is not immutable. The authorities are clear that so long as the parties are left without doubt as to what is MAT.APP.(F.C.) 7/2014 Page 10 required to be traversed, inexactitude in the plea is not a bar; it is the substance of the pleading that matter, rather than the text. The Supreme Court held so, in Konda Lakshmana Bapuji v Govt of A.P.AIR 2002 SC 1012 that:\n\"..it is a settled position that if the parties have understood the pleadings of each other correctly, an issue was also framed by the Court, the parties led evidence in support of their respective cases, then the absence of a specific plea would be no difference.\"\nIn Nedunari Kameshwaramma v Sampati Subba Rao: [1963] 2SCR 208, a three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court observed that:\n\"Though the appellant had not mentioned a Karnikam service in am parties well understood that the two cases opposed to each other were of Dharmila Sarvadumbala inam as against a Karnikam service inam. The evidence which has been led in the case clearly showed that the respondent attempted to prove that this was a Dharmila inam and to refute that this was a Karnikam service inam. No doubt, no issue was framed, and the one, which was framed, could have been more elaborate; but since the parties went to trial fully knowing the rival case and led all the evidence not only in support of their contentions but in refutation of those of the other side, it cannot be said that in absence of an issue was fatal to the case, or that there was that mis-trial which vitiates proceedings.' This view was approved by in Kali Prasad (Dead) by LRS & Ors v Bharat Coking Coal Ltd & Ors1989 (2) SCR 283. In Sardul Singh v Pritam Singh & Ors 1999 (2) SCR 22, it was held as follows:\n\"It is well-settled that notwithstanding the absence of pleadings before a court or authority, still if an issue is framed and the parties were conscious of it and went to trial on that issue and adduced evidence and had an opportunity to produce evidence or cross examine witnesses in relation to the said issue, no MAT.APP.(F.C.) 7/2014 Page 11 objection as to want of specific pleading can be permitted to be raised later...\"\n16. Nand Kishore is an authority for the proposition that a husband, to successfully claim that the property in the name of his wife is really his and that he is entitled to recover possession, or base a claim for relief in the capacity of owner, should show that at the time of purchase of the property, his intention was that the property was not for benefit of the wife. The requirements of proof in Section 3 were explained in a later judgment, G. Mahalingappa vs G.M. Savitha2005 (6) SCC 441 where the following findings were recorded:\n\"As noted herein earlier, the following findings of fact were arrived at by the appellate court and the trial court to conclude that the transaction in question was benami in nature :-\n1) the appellant had paid the purchase money.\n2) the original title deed was with the appellant. And\n3) the appellant had mortgaged the suit property for raising loan to improve the same.\n4) he paid taxes for the suit property.\n5) he had let out the suit property to defendant Nos. 2 to 5 and collecting rents from them.\n6) the motive for purchasing the suit property in the name of plaintiff was that the plaintiff was born on an auspicious nakshatra and the appellant believed that if the property was purchased in the name of plaintiff/respondent, the appellant would prosper.\n7) the circumstances surrounding the transaction, relationship of the parties and subsequent conduct of the appellant tend to show that the transaction was benami in nature.\n********** *********** ********* Section 3 (2) makes it abundantly clear that if a property is purchased in the name of an unmarried daughter for her benefit, that would only be a presumption but the presumption can be rebutted by the person who is alleging to be the real owner of the property by production of evidences or other MAT.APP.(F.C.) 7/2014 Page 12 materials before the court. In this case, the trial court as well as the appellate court concurrently found that although the suit property was purchased in the name of the respondent but the same was purchased for the interest of the appellant. We are therefore of the opinion that even if the presumption under section 3 (2) of the Act arose because of purchase of the suit property by the father (in this case appellant ) in the name of his daughter ( in this case respondent ), that presumption got rebutted as the appellant had successfully succeeded by production of cogent evidence to prove that the suit property was purchased in the benami of the respondent for his own benefit.\"\n17. An earlier decision, Jayadayal Poddar v Bibi Hazra, AIR 1979 SC 171, explained the factors which are to be considered while deciding whether a property is benami or not:\n\"the essence of a benami is the intention of the party or parties concerned; and not unoften such intention is shrouded in a thick veil which cannot be easily pierced through. But such difficulties do not relieve the person asserting the transaction to be benami of any part of the serious onus that rests on him; nor justify the acceptance of mere conjectures or surmises, as a substitute for proof. The reason is that a deed is a solemn document prepared and executed after considerable deliberation, and the person expressly shown as the purchaser or transferee in the deed, starts with the initial presumption in his favour that the apparent state of affairs is the real state of affairs. Though the question, whether a particular sale is benami or not, is largely one of fact, and for determining this question, no absolute formulae or acid test, uniformly applicable in all situations, can be laid down; yet in weighing the probabilities and for gathering the relevant indicia, the courts are usually guided by these circumstances : (1) the source from which the purchase money came; (2) the nature and possession of the property, after the purchase; (3) motive, if any, for giving the transaction a benami colour; (4) the position of the parties and the relationship, if any, between the claimant and the alleged benamidar; (5) the custody of the MAT.APP.(F.C.) 7/2014 Page 13 conduct of the parties concerned in dealing with the property after the sale. ...\"\nThese tests were reiterated in Thakur Bhim Singh (Dead) by LRs & Anr v Thakur Kan Singh 1980 (3) SCC 72 and Binapani Paul vs Pratima Ghosh 2007 (6) SCC 100.\n18. Here it would be important to recognize that a plain interpretation of Section 3 would be firstly, that benami transactions are barred; the exception would be, inter alia, where the husband acquires the property in the wife's name. Secondly, this exception has an attendant presumption that the property had been purchased for the wife's benefit. However, the presumption is rebuttable, as the contrary (i.e. that the property was not for the benefit or the wife, or was for the benefit of another or others) can be proved. What is the net result if the contrary is proved? Would the property then be treated as benami and suffer the bar under Section 4? We think not. The structure of Section 3 is such that two categories of what would otherwise be benami acquisitions are kept out from its sweep- purchase in the name of wife, and purchase in the name of unmarried daughter. It would indeed be anomalous if it were held that Parliament intended that in case the husband did not prove that the property was for the benefit of someone not the wife, it would be hers and at the same time, also intended that in case he did prove that it was for someone else's benefit, he would be unable to secure a decree as he would be remediless because of Section 4. The correct interpretation would be, in our opinion that the class of transactions covered by Section 3 is treated as a class apart. It is only the inter se rights of the disputing parties, which is dependent upon the party asserting that the MAT.APP.(F.C.) 7/2014 Page 14 acquisition was not for the benefit of the wife/daughter, proving it to be so. Thus, for instance, if a dishonest debtor were to use all or substantial monies under threat of imminent legal action by the creditors to recover dues, for the purchase of property in his wife's name, and the creditor were to prove that it was not for the benefit of the wife, but to defeat their rights, Section 4 cannot be said to bar the relief. In such event, the relief of securing a decree to recover money, which can be traced to the purchase of property, or an appropriate decree of cancellation or declaration and sale, would lie. Therefore, in any given case if the party asserts that the purchase was not for the benefit of the wife or unmarried daughter, it only means that he discharges the onus of proof and qualifies for the relief he seeks, because the controlling part of Section 3 (2) operates and treats the transaction as not a benami transaction. The second salient feature, which needs to be underlined, is that unlike the pre-Benami Act era- where the party had to assert and prove that the property was purchased benami, now the situation has reversed due to a paradigm shift under the Act. The endeavor of the party seeking relief would be to fall within Section 3(2), i.e., that the purchase is not deemed to be benami, to qualify for relief.\n19. In this case, the overall effect of the pleadings and evidence is that:\n(1) The suit property was purchased with the husband's money, in the wife's name.\n(2) The husband secured a Bank loan for the purchase of the property. This would mean that the property is mortgaged to the bank.\n(3) The husband continues to be liable for the loan and is making\nMAT.APP.(F.C.) 7/2014 Page 15\n repayment towards installments.\n(4) The suit property became the family home as long as parties\nwere married.\n(5) The appellant wife left the property in 2010 and never returned.\n\nThe parties later dissolved their marriage by mutual consent (6) The two children live with the husband, in the suit property. (7) Though the defendant/wife stated that she was repaying the loan, she was unable to prove that allegation.\n(8) The husband, in the cross examination stated that since stamp duty payable was at a lower rate if the vendees were women, he decided to purchase stamp paper in the wife's name, and complete the transaction. On the basis of the above it can clearly be held that the plaintiff discharged the onus which lay upon him to prove that the property was purchased not for the wife's benefit, but for that of the family as a whole.\n20. By reason of the foregoing analysis, it is held that the appeal is meritless. It is therefore dismissed without order as to costs.\nS.

The court accepts the application for arrest warrants and an order is passed.\nIf accused has appeared before the court in FIR case and then stops appearing, court issues arrest warrants.\nIn a private complaint case, if accused does not appear despite of notice, court can start PO proceedings.\n\nWith the help of arrest warrants, police raids several places and takes statements of persons residing near the Indian address of the accused. In case no such last known address is available with the police, the police informs the court about this fact. If the police is unable to trace the accused, proclamation under section 82 and 83 of Criminal Procedure Code is issued against the accused by an order of the court. After proclamation has been issued, statement of the serving Constable is recorded in the court. Generally, on the date statement of serving Constable is recorded in the court, an accused person is declared proclaimed offender.\nIn case the accused NRI does not want to visit India during his lifetime, he should not be worried at all about this. There are very less chances of extradition of a person from another country to India. The problems arise only if the accused person wants to visit India. In such cases, one should never file anticipatory bail in the lower court (district court). One should file quashing of the order declaring an accused person proclaimed offender directly in High Court having the jurisdiction. In such cases, a prayer is made that the accused person who is not in India wants to come to India and wants to surrender before the court in which the case is pending. Further prayer is made in such quashing petition is that in case the accused person surrenders before the court, he should not be arrested and should be released on bail immediately on surrender because the accused person himself is coming to India and submitting to the jurisdiction of Indian courts on his own accord and is ready to face trial.\nWhat to do once you have been declared Proclaimed Offender (PO)?\nOnce\u00a0NRI\u00a0has been declared Proclaimed Offender (PO), it is not advisable to file a petition for anticipatory bail.

At the time of filing suit in the court, we made 3 parties (accused) including the employer company in this case.\r\n\r\n2. The court issued summons to both foreign nationals to appear in the court but unfortunately missed to issue summons against the company (3rd party in the case). Unfortunately, my lawyer neither noticed nor take any action to get issued summons against the company also.\r\n\r\n3. Employer company received the summons issued against both foreign nationals and came in the court and submitted a reply (without having any summons sent to the company) and helped both foreign nationals to run away from the country. \r\n\r\n4. They submitted a reply that both accused are not now working with them, while we produced dozens of proofs including videos that they are still their employees and the company is helping them to hide. Court took cognizance on our proofs and issued summons against the company in 340 CrPC case for producing fake/false documents and proofs.\r\n\r\n5. Both foreign nationals never came in court.\r\n\r\n6. Till now, the court has issued NBWs 5 times and both foreign nationals have run away from the country with the help of the employer company. Police have raided their office also twice.\r\n\r\nMy Questions:-\r\n\r\n1. How can I get issued summons to the company from the Court now in criminal defamation case (First Point - As it was also made a party at the time of filing the suit in the beginning and the Second point - Company helped them to run away from the country and we had produced dozens of proofs to establish it also including videos, photos, and other legal documents and 340 CrPC case has also been filed and summons have been issued in 340 CrPC to the company)\r\n\r\n2. Please guide me with the provisions also\r\n\r\n3. It is a criminal defamation case and both accused will never come back to India now. How can I get justice now? Can the court punish the company to help the accused running away from the country? If yes, Punishment can be in compensation format or jail (Company\u2019s director or Staff who gave false proofs in the court)? Any judgment or provision or example/case?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks",

In this case, the spouses had been separated and were living separately for about 8 years, and had arrived at mutually amicable settlements regarding property and custody even before filing the divorce petition. The court then had to deal with the question of whether in these circumstances, where there has been a considerable passage of time and thought on the part of the separating spouses already, the six months cooling off period was still mandatory.\nHistorically, courts have waived this 6 month cooling period requirement in exceptional circumstances but had not conclusively laid down the law on whether it is a mandatory or directory (i.e., to be decided on a case to case basis). In the present case, the Supreme Court also touched upon the previous cases where this cooling-off period had been waived because the court was of the opinion that the marriage in question had irretrievably broken down, and such a \u201ccool off\u201d period would only cause mental agony to the separating spouses.\nKNOW MORE ON MUTUAL DIVORCE\nMoreover, the court also proceeded to analyse whether the 6 month period envisaged under the section was mandatory or merely directory in nature. It was observed that the rationale behind the cooling-off period was to allow the separating spouses to re-consider and give more thought to the matter so that divorce is only granted if there is absolutely no possibility of reconciliation. It was held that if there was absolutely no chance of reconciliation, courts should not be powerless with respect to enabling the spouses to move ahead with their respective lives.\nFinally, the court held that Section 13B(2) is thus directory and not mandatory and that in future, if any court dealing with a case of mutual divorce is satisfied that an appropriate case has been made our to waive the cooling-off period, it may do so subject to the following:\n\nA period of one year and six months of the spouses living separately has already passed, before filling of the divorce petition itself.\nEnforcing the six months would only prolong the agony of the separating spouses.\nThe spouses have legitimately settled their differences and arrived at amicable resolutions on alimony, child custody, joint property, etc.\nAll efforts at reconciliation or mediation have failed, and there is no possibility of success through any further efforts.\n\nThe court further directed that such an application for waiver of the 6 months may be filed one week after the first motion, citing adequate reasons for the same. In case the criteria mentioned above are fulfilled, the waiver of the cooling-off period will be at the discretion of the court.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFeel Free to Call"

He's pretending to prove himself a fatal psychotic stalker who'd hurt me and family irrevocably.

After so many efforts i was not able to receive my compensation.\r\n\r\n I met with a person through a common friend who promised me that he can get the payment released in 10 days as he had very good contacts with the land acquisition officer. He said that he will charge 20 lakhs for that and payment will be released in 10 days.\r\n\r\n So as a security i issued him a cheque of 20 lakhs with no date mentioned. Apart from the cheque We did not do any paperwork or we didn't sign any document. It was only the cheque that i issued.\r\n\r\n After 20 days(15 th September 2016) also he was not able to get my payment so i stopped the payment on 15th September 2016 by requesting my bank to stop payment. Now today 4th November that person is threatening me that he will put my cheque in the bank and will file a case if payment is stopped earlier.\r\n\r\nWhat is my legal liability in this case as there is no legally executed document between us and cheque was stopped for payment as i didn't receive the services promised by him verbally. Also the cheque is not bounced due to insufficient payment but it is payment stopped by drawer.\r\n\r\nWhat preventive measures can i take to safeguard myself??",

If the accused shows that in his account there was sufficient funds to clear the amount of the cheque at the time of presentation of the cheque for encashment at the drawer bank and that the stop payment notice had been issued because of other valid causes including that there was no existing debt or liability at the time of presentation of cheque for encashment, then offence under Section 138 would not be made out.

This seems to be unfair and unreasonable on their part. You have every right to resign from your job and join a new company as per your wish and convenience.\nThere are some legal aspects and options that you should be aware of regarding your situation. Here are some of them:\nThe company's insistence on you serving the full notice period before releasing the relieving letter might be seen as unjust and unreasonable. Legally, as per the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, Section 25F, both an employer and employee must provide at least a month's notice, or the equivalent salary, for termination or resignation respectively. This notice period can be altered based on the employment contract or mutual agreement. Any extension of the notice period through a circular without your agreement might not be enforceable. Employers must issue a relieving letter once the notice period or its monetary equivalent is fulfilled. If they don't, they might be legally accountable for breach of contract and harassment. In case of disputes, you have the right to approach legal avenues like sending a legal notice, consulting the labour commissioner, or approaching the labour court. Always consider seeking legal advice from professionals before making a decision."

Interestingly, GPA is revocable or can even be terminated at any time unless made irrevocable in a manner known to law.\nGPA is Not Irrevocable\nThe law is that even if the parties have determined that the GPA is irrevocable it won\u2019t have the effect of transferring title to the grantee. Thus, in totality GPA does not convey ownership of the buyer; however, a GPA holder may execute a deed of conveyance in exercise of the power granted under the power of attorney and convey title on behalf of the grantor.\nTaking the judgment from the Supreme of India into consideration it\u2019s a settled law now that immovable property can be legally and lawfully transferred or conveyed only by a registered deed of conveyance and not through GPA. Thus, as GPA does not conclude complete transaction, the Supreme Court parties should consider registering the deed of conveyance.\nThe Supreme Court in the case had however, observed that GPA transactions may also be used to obtain specific performance or to defend possession under section 53A of Transfer of Property Act, 1882."

THE STATE OF KARNATAKA\n REPRESENTED BY\n REVENUE SECRETARY,\nKarnataka High Court\nSri Kumaran Childrens Home vs The State Of Karnataka on 1 December, 2014\n7. Firstly, the appellants are trying to take shelter under the premise that, in view of Section 104 of the Act, the provisions of Sections 64, 79A, 79B and 80 of the Act are not applicable to the lands in question since they are coffee lands and Section 104 reads as under:\n\"104. Plantations: The provisions of section 38, section 63 other than sub-section (9) thereof, Ss.64, 79A, 79B & 80, shall not apply to plantations.\nExplanation: In this section 'Plantation' means land used by a person principally for the cultivation of plantation crop and includes,-\n (i) any land used by such\n person for any purpose\n ancillary to the cultivation of\n such crop or for preparation\n of the same for the market;\n and\n (ii) agricultural land\n interspersed within the\n boundaries of the area\n cultivated with such crop by\n such person.\n not exceeding such extent as may be\ndetermined by the prescribed authority as necessary for the protection and efficient management of such cultivation\".\nBut the benefit of Section 104 of the Act is not available to the Society for the simple reason that the Society is not registered as an owner under the provisions of Coffee Act. It is the mandate of Section 14 of Coffee Act, that an owner of the coffee plantation shall get registered his Coffee estate with the State Government in respect of the estate owned by him. The said provision reads thus:\n\"Section 14 of the Coffee Act reads as follows:\n14. Registration of owners of coffee estates: [(1) Every owner of land planted with coffee plants, whether such land is comprised in one estate or in more than one estate and whether it is situated wholly or only partly in India, shall, before the expiration of the month from the date on which he first became owner of such estate or estates, apply to the registering officer appointed in this behalf by the State Government to be registered as an owner in respect of each estate owned by him; and any registration made before the commencement of the Coffee (Amendment) Act, 1961 (48 of 1961), shall be deemed to have been made under this sub-section].\n(3) A registration once made shall continue in force until it is cancelled by the registering officer.\"\n=======================================================================================\nAgricultural land can be bought in Karnataka after fulfilling certain requirements.\nThese include:\nThe annual average income of the person including agricultural income should be less than Rs 25 lakhs.\nThe person must have had an agricultural land in his name before the year 1974. The person should be an agriculturist or an agricultural worker by profession.\nAs per Section 79A of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act 1961, the non-agricultural income of a purchaser who must be an agriculturist should not exceed Rs 25 lakhs per year. Sale of land granted to members of scheduled caste and tribe is not allowed. Also, sale of land granted by the government is not allowed for a period of 15 years. Agricultural land can be used only for agricultural purposes and no other purposes. Utilising agricultural land for any other purpose is prohibited by law. Agricultural land, which does not come under the Green Belt, can be converted for non-agricultural purposes like residential, commercial, industrial etc, subject to the approval of the Special Deputy Commissioner on payment of the prescribed fees and subject to certain conditions.\nDear Sir,\nYou must satisfy the following conditions, if not then you must get a certificate showing you are agricultural labor. The later is easy because even Amithab Bachan taken such certificate to legalize his purchase of agricultural fields that is coffee estates.\n(i) That he is coming from agricultural family and holding agricultural lands as on prescribed date i.e., 01.03.1974.\n(ii) That his individual income is less than Rs. 2,00,000/- per annum and \n(iii) That he is having source of income to purchase above agricultural land.\nAgricultural land can be bought in Karnataka after fulfilling certain requirements.\nThese include:\nThe annual average income of the person including agricultural income should be less than Rs 25 lakhs.\nThe person must have had an agricultural land in his name before the year 1974. The person should be an agriculturist or an agricultural worker by profession.\nAs per Section 79A of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act 1961, the non-agricultural income of a purchaser who must be an agriculturist should not exceed Rs 25 lakhs per year. \n===================================================================\nKARNATAKA LAND REFORMS ACT 1961\nRESTRICTIONS ON 1\n[HOLDING OR]\nTRANSFER OF AGRICULTURAL LANDS\n[79A.

After 2 years of marriage, my mother-in-law insisted that I go to my parents home to complete my phd. After one month, my husband called to say that he has shifted our stuff to another place and that we will live separetely. Without my knowledge he shifted all my things except my jewellery to a dingy small room without any window or ventillation. I stayed there for one week and we had a fight after which he left and did not return and his family also went missing the same day. I filed a missing complaint in his name and he returned after one week to polices station. I was out of town at that time. When I came back he told me that he need time to think about us and right now cannot live with me. I gave him 2 weeks to think and when he did not reciprocate I filed a complaint in women cell. He did not take any call from police. Now police has sent a notice to his home and his parents have debarred him from his property and said he doesn't live there anymore. What should I do? I don't want to end the relation. He is saying he doesn't know if he wants to continue the marriage. I don't want my Ph.D to suffer as well. Also, he has never spent a single penny on me. Before I went to my parents home, we went to Europe for my conference and mostly I paid for the trip. My scholarship has ended in september last year. SHould I wait for him to take any action if at all he takes (that too not sure)? I have no idea where he is residing now or what he wants. Is there any law wherein court can force him to take me back till divorce is granted or atleast visit for reconcilation in women cell?",

        "query-text": "Hello sir, I am Jyoti aged 34 years. It has been only one month to my marriage. My husband works in a private company. I work as a medical professional in AIIMS Delhi. \r\n\r\nMy father expired when I was 10. I have one elder brother and two sisters. Elder sister is married. My only brother was transferred to Assam by his office. Now the family responsibility came on my shoulder. My widowed mother remains ill and needs proper medical care. Being in a medical profession, My brother, sisters take my help in knowing about her treatment and medications. \r\n My jija Ji told my brother about a boy in his relation for marriage purpose for me. Later on marriage got fixed on 18 June 2017. We got agree because Jija Ji knew the boy and his family very well. The family was well acquainted with my family condition. The only thing they told me before marriage was that they are Radha Soami and don't eat non-vegetarian. They asked me to quit non-vegetarian food. \r\n I told them about my office working hours which is 9:30am to 5:30pm. I told them I reach home at 6:30pm. I told that in emergency I may have to stay in office for more time. I told them these things before marriage.\r\nMarriage took place on 18 June. As the days went my father-in-law said me I eat at 6:30pm. This time is permanent and I can't change it. \r\nSir please note I reach at home at 6:30pm. How is it possible to serve him food at 6:30pm. My mother in law blamed me and said \"Bahu ke aane ke baad bhi Khana mujhe hi banana pdta hai\". \r\n One day father-in-law asked me to discuss about financial planning for future. He suggested me and to invest my surplus money in FDs and asked me to talk to husband about this. When I discussed him about financial planning, he was totally not interested. He shouted on me and blamed me for degrading him on grounds of his low salary. I never asked him how much his Income is. I just wanted to do what his father asked me to do. \r\nOne day my father in law asked about my grade pay and GPF. I said I have NPS not GPF. He asked me to show my salary slip to him. He asked many questions regarding DA, TA. He suggested me for more investments if I could do. My salary slip was showing loan (4 lacs) repayment installment. Now he constantly asks my brother that jyoti has taken loan why. Sir as my father was expired, and there is no financial back to us, we have done everything on our own. Since I have one more sister to be married. I took loan for my marriage. \r\nMoreover my husband and my in laws do not allow me to talk to my ill widow mother. My brother and sisters have to take my help for treatment of our mother. They don't let me to call my brother and sister. They put restrictions on me to go to my maternal home. \r\nBefore my marriage I was treating my mother and giving her medicines for she is a patient of schizophrenia. \r\nNow my Inlaws and my husband want me to divorce. They say either talk to your brother or be ready for divorce.",

        "query-text": "I have been married 8 years, we have one child 15 months old. My husband has asked for a divorce, he has been unfaithful, he does not know I have proof. What type of settlement can I get? He is very well off, a very high paying job (avg. 7 lak a month) but we have never had joint accounts and he has never given me much money or expenses apart from house maintainence. He has hardly bought me anything major over the years, including jewellery or car etc. All has come from my parents. I was working until I became pregnant (40k salary). He wants mutual divorce and is threatening to take away my son, if I don't give a mutual consent. He has also been an absent father, from birth of our son. My in laws hate me, and never treat me well - more of mental harrasment without any physical pain. \r\nFor all damages, can I ask for a one time settlement of 8 crore for me and my son, and I want full sole custody and guardianship, 1 Crore for each year of marriage? Is it realistic to expect this much? If not what is more realistic, what is an appropriate expectation? I know him and his family have the means to pay although he is pretending to have a mere 15 lak in his bank. I want to try make sure he does not escape easily for all the torture and betrayal he has put me through. For the past 5 months he has been very bad to me, verbally abusive and generally harassing me a lot. \r\nThanks.",

According to the recent statistical data, 225 women from metro cities get married to NRIs every year and out of these around 25 want to end their marriage due to reasons of hiding facts or of deception. This is the reason why it is important for Indians who marry NRIs to have knowledge of laws related to NRI divorce. Many of NRI weddings end in divorce due to the reasons like:\n\nThe NRI spouses inflate their assets like home, high paid job, or vehicle in the foreign country but actually might not be in a position to support a family after marriage.\nThe NRI spouse happens to have another spouse, settled with him abroad.\nThe NRI spouse feels that Indian spouse is not a suitable partner in coping up with him and his advanced lifestyle and hence, seeks divorce on the grounds of incompatibility.\n\nHowever, The Process Needs one to Furnish the Following Information for Completion of Divorce Process:\n\nWhere was one married? India or Abroad\nDoes one have children?\nWill both be able to reach a financial settlement of their possessions?\nWhat is the religion of both the partners?\nWhich country is one based in?\nWhat is his or her nationality?\n\nEven though, there are not many laws to protect the interest of Indians who marry NRIs but due to rise in the number of troubled marriages of NRIs with Indians, the government is introducing NGOs in both India as well as abroad and these shall guide Indian men and women who are married to NRIs and settled abroad. They offer emotional support, counseling, and legal advice in the process of divorce and separation. Another thing to be kept in mind is that even if the divorce is taking place abroad, it would be good to appoint an attorney who is proficient in Indian divorce laws related to NRIs.\nThe Basic Laws Related to NRI Divorce, That One Must be Well Aware of are:\n\nIf both the spouses are settled in USA, or any other foreign country, then they can seek divorce by mutual consent under the foreign marriages divorce laws of that country.\nIf both the spouses are Indians and have been married under Hindu marriage Act 1955, in that case they can seek divorce with mutual consent under section 13-B."

I seek your advice on what is the punishment he gets if convicted , is there no provision of punishment to his Father.\nDrawing curtains over a 11-year-old litigation drama in which the victim's father was given a raw deal, the apex court on September 24 directed the insurance company to immediately pay up the compensation amount and recover it from the father, Rakesh Kumar Arora, whose 15-year-old son, Karan Arora, had run over a person in 1997 while driving his father's car.\nFinally, the most practical deterrent has come from the Supreme Court that is likely to force parents to keep their car keys away from their minor sons and daughters. For, if these minors cause any accident, it will be their parents who will have to cough up the compensation.\nNo more flaunting of parents' luxury cars by underage sons and daughters. This appeared to be the stern message given by a Bench comprising Justices S B Sinha and Cyriac Joseph.\nThus it is not a new thing that the father of the minor can be held liable to pay the compensation.\n304A. Causing death by negligence.--Whoever causes the death of any person by doing any rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.\nThe provisions of this section apply to cases where there is no intention to cause death, and no knowledge that the act done in all probability would cause death. \nIt is the first of its kind case since the amendment in the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, which allowed the board to transfer cases of heinous offences by children to sessions courts. As per section 2(33) of the Act, \u201cheinous offences\u201d include those for which the minimum punishment under the Indian Penal Code or any other law in force is imprisonment for seven years or more.\nThe police had on May 26 chargesheeted the juvenile in the JJB for the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, which entails a maximum punishment of 10 years imprisonment.\nThus the juvenile cannot escape after committing such offences."

The distinction between an appeal and a revision is a real one.\nAppeal:\u00a0There is no definition of the word \u201cappeal\u201d in any statute. It can be defined as the judicial examination by a higher Court of a decision of an inferior Court. It is a legal proceeding by which a case is brought before a higher court for review of the decision of a lower court. Appeal is a process of re-examination by a higher court of the judgment, or the order or the decision made by a lower court in a suit or in a case. Appeal is the right of entering a superior court and invoking its aid and interposition to redress the error of the court below. It is a proceeding taken before a superior court for reversing or modifying the decision of an inferior court on ground of error.\nRevision:\u00a0Revision is the act of examining again in order to remove\u00a0 any defect or grant relief against irregular or improper exercise or non-exercise of jurisdiction by a lower court. Revision is like re-working and re-writing. Revision means the action of revising, especially critical or careful examination or perusal with a view to correcting or improving.\nIn Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.), the provisions relating to appeal are contained in Sections 372 to 394, while provisions relating to revision are contained in Sections 397 to 405.\nIn Civil Procedure Code (CPC), the provisions relating to appeal are contained in Sections 96 to 112, while provisions relating to revision are contained in Section 115.\nGenerally speaking, there are following major differences between the legal terms \u201cappeal\u201d and \u201crevision\u201d (though the actual difference between these terms will depend upon the provisions of the law in which they are contained, such as in Criminal Procedure Code or in Civil Procedure Code or in the other relevant laws):\n\nAppeal is generally a legal right of a party, but revision depends on the discretion of the Court, due to which it cannot be claimed as a matter of right. In particular, in criminal cases, at least one appeal is a substantive right conferred on accused by the statute (and it is also considered a part of the fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution), while the revision power is discretionary and is not a matter of right.\nIn case of appeal, the appellant is heard by the court. But, it is not necessary in the case of a revision and the person filing the revision may not be formally heard.\nUnder the Civil Procedure Code, an appeal lies to a superior court (which may not necessary be a High Court), while a revision application lies only to the High Court (under Section 115 of the Code).\nUnder the Criminal Procedure Code, the appeal lies to a superior court (which may be any superior court as laid down in the relevant provisions), but the revision lies only to the High Court or the Sessions Court (Section 399 of Cr.P.C.).\nAppeal is required to be filed by a party to the proceedings, but revision can also be exercised\u00a0suo motu\u00a0by the higher court having the power of revision.\nGenerally, revision is exercised against those orders which are not appealable.\nGenerally, appeal involves rehearing on question of law as well as on facts of the case, whereas revision generally involves hearing only the question of law and this is not considered a rehearing.\nAn appeal is considered to be a continuation of the original proceeding whereas revision is not the continuation of the original proceeding.\n\n\u00a0\nIn case the revision is rejected, you may approach the HC against the said order OR you may approach any other higher court.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRegards"

They directly said to me that I should not spend money on my sister marriage and my mom. Even though my dad expired three years ago. I tried convincing them saying it's my responsibility and all.\r\n\r\nI have stopped talking with my in-laws, but through my wife, they created a lot of issues. My wife directly said if I am hearing her parents she is ready to be with me. Meantime one fine day, she fought a lot and throwing mangalyam she wanted to go her parents home. \r\n\r\nI have dropped her, and her parents not ready for talks. I tried to talk with her grandparents and relatives to settle the issues. Her relatives also said her parents won't hear if we say also if you need that girl go and talk with them. \r\n\r\nSomehow, they never ready to talk with anyone. My wife joined hostel nearby my house itself and started forcing me to come and talk with her parents. Then they started talking as divorce saying I humiliated them before her relatives. When I was not ready for divorce her mom spread news to my relatives as I am impotent that's why looking for divorce as. \r\n\r\nFinally, we went for Mutual divorce to court after 3 months of marriage. The judge scolded and said we should not come to court for divorce anytime like. After judge got transferred, we again went to court in 8 months. This time court gave us 6 months of time for reconciliation (First Motion).\r\n\r\nDue to work, I have moved to the USA, and even I told them to wait for sometime to close the case. After getting my visa extended when I go court found that lawyer has withdrawn the mutual consent divorce by taking the advance date. Case got disposed of with: Uncontested--DISMISSED AS NOT PRESSED.\r\n\r\nSametime, she filed a new petition for divorce under 13(1). I have not got the notice to appear for about 3 months. When I tried to give petition looking for notice in court. Judge not ready to take my petition and asked me to come on hearing date. I have sent my petitions to judge through Register post with acknowledgment. \r\n\r\nSame time, her lawyer sent a notice to my Office HR dept saying I am not attending court and giving mental torture to the girl.\r\n\r\nLater in Jan,2018 hearing court served NOTICE. Postman not ready to handover the notice to my mom. When I discussed with lawyer to appear on behalf of me. He has mentioned as without notice what we can appear.\r\n\r\nFinally, asked my lawyer to discuss with her lawyer to know what we can do. After discussion, my lawyer mentioning to me as not to attend the case let it be ex-parte divorce. He asked me to come to india to sign vakkalat and asked me to give petition to postal dept to deliver any letters in my name to my mom.\r\n\r\nIs there is any future issues possible if I become ex-parte?\r\nIs there is any way to attend new case referring mutual - divorce and getting a divorce in the new petition?\r\n\r\nThanks in Advance for your valuable suggestions",

It provides for exemption of long-term capital gains on transfer of any asset, if the net sale consideration is reinvested in acquisition of a residential house. One of the conditions in order to claim the benefit of this exemption is that on the date of transfer of the asset, the taxpayer should not own more than one other residential house.\nJoint ownership for the sake of convenience is certainly not regarded as an ownership for the purpose of tax laws, and therefore the prohibition would not apply to such cases. In case of beneficial joint ownership, each joint owner would be regarded as a beneficial owner of the property in the proportion of the cost of the property borne by her to the total cost of the property.\nFor instance, for a property costing Rs.10 lakh acquired in joint names of A and B, if A has paid Rs.7.5 lakh and B has paid Rs.2.5 lakh towards the cost of the property, they would be regarded as joint owners of the property in the ratio of 75% and 25%, respectively. It is really in such cases of beneficial joint ownership that one needs to consider as to whether it amounts to ownership of the house by each joint owner.\nSo far, the view clearly was that even joint ownership of a house qualifies as ownership of a house."

Making it easier for them to get their troubled marriages dissolved at the earliest and start afresh, the Bombay high court on Friday directed family courts not to insist on personal presence of the parties and accept joint pleas for divorce by mutual consent even if the consents are signed by their registered power of attorneys.\nJustice Bharati Dangre on Friday struck down a January 1, 2018 order of the principal judge of the family court at Pune refusing to register a petition filed by an estranged couple under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, seeking divorce by mutual consent. The family court had refused to register their plea on the ground that the consent terms did not bear the wife\u2019s signature. Instead, her father had signed the document on her behalf.\nThe single-judge high court bench struck down the order, saying power of attorney is an authorized person through whom pleadings can be duly made and verified. The judge said provisions of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) are applicable to the proceedings before the family courts and under provisions of the CPC, pleadings can be verified by either the person pleading it or by some other person who is acquainted with the facts of the case.\nDue to globalisation a number of educated people are going abroad and it is not possible for each of them to remain present before the court and there is nothing illegal in trying to resolve such difficulties by adopting novel and available ways by use of advanced technology, the judge quoted from the judgment of another judge of the high court.\n\nWhile the petitioner woman\u2019s estranged husband was available in Pune, the woman was unable to personally remain present before the family court for signing and verifying the consent terms. This is because she is employed in the United States of America and the terms of her employment did not allow her to return to India when the joint plea was filed in December 2017."

Since he executed a New Will wherein he has mentioned that the property will be inherited in accordance to law of inheritance, his class I heirs ( 3 sisters, 1 brother ) will inherit the property in equal shares.\u00a0\n4) All surviving legal heirs ( 3 Sisters and 1 Brother) will inherit the house property in equal shares and if the building is divisible by meets and bounds (i.e physical partition of property is possible), then each one of you can also do physical division of the house property.\n5) Where physical division is not possible, interested legal heirs can buy out the share of other legal heirs based on fair market valuation obtained from independent government approved valuer's.\u00a0\n6) At Delhi, an application for probate of Will has to be made before the court and court will examine one of the witnesses and then validate the WILL.\u00a0\n7) In general, if all the legal heirs agree that the WILL is genuine, actually there is no need for probate of WILL of through courts.\u00a0\n8) However probate of WILL will stand in good stead\u00a0 when the house property is inherited by the children of present legal heirs.\n9) In cases of no contest WILLS, courts will fast track the procedure and you can get a judgment and decree within 6 months.\n10) If any of the legal heir is living outside of India, then, they can grant special power of attorney to the other legal heirs living in India to complete the process.\u00a0\nHope this Information is useful"

Legal notice and plaint were prepared by a lawyer in city and he referred another 2nd lawyer to run the case in a court situated far away from city.

I appointed 3rd lawyer who asked initial fees and fees on hearing basis, which I paid in his bank account. \r\n\r\nNew lawyer crossed defendant and made oral arguments. After the case is decreed in my favour, new lawyer surprisingly claimed big amount as \"case completion fees\" and refused to hand over the decree copy for MANY months, inspite of compromise talks. I sent message to his cell number: I have already paid fees to 2 lawyers prior to you and why you did not ask case completion fees when I gave vakalat to you, for which he never replied. \r\n\r\nSo, I sent termination notice to this lawyer, and filed affidavit+petition as party in person, praying court to revoke vakalat and issue decree copy. I also submitted my bank statement showing lawyer fees deposits in the bank account of new lawyer. new lawyer objected in court, asked date to file objection.\r\n\r\n1) if lawyer files objection, can judge refuse to give decree copy to me?\r\n2) If so, under what Order and Rule of CPC?\r\n3) does the vakalat given by me expires when the case is decreed?\r\n4) Is it legal for lawyer to object, while he has the legal remedy to file recovery case against me to claim \"case completion fees\"?\r\n\r\n---------------- Judicial Custody for 420 -----------\r\n\r\nAfter receiving legal notice for above case, defendant settled his assets to wife with the help of his 2 sons and filed insolvency. Based on my complaint, police registered FIR against IPC 420 and 421 against defendant and 2 sons. \r\nPolice said they will file charge sheet shortly, but they will not include 2 sons and IPC 421 in charge sheet.\r\n\r\n5) what petition to file to include 2 sons and IPC 421?\r\n6) petition to be filed before Magistrate or sessions or high court?\r\n7) petition to be filed before or after filing charge sheet?\r\n8) petition to be filed by PP or through my lawyer?\r\n\r\nThis accused has made my life miserable for the past 4 years. I requested Police to arrest accused and produce before court for judicial custody, so that accused can apply bail, but Police refused and said that they will file charge sheet and issue summons to accused. \r\n\r\n9) what should be done legally, to make police arrest accused and produce before court for judicial custody, since 420 will be included in charge sheet?\r\n\r\nThanks all for your reply",

Also in all likelihood if completion certificate has been issued prior to 01-july-2017, and hence GST per se is not applicable at all in your case. \n4) If at the builder is to recover the money, he can only claim GST on interest payable on account of delayed payment and nothing else. \n5) Please refer to https://cbec-gst.gov.in/pdf/press-release/reduced-tax-liability-gstregime2.pdf dated [deleted].\n6) It is amply clear from the guideline (section 6 and 7) the demand of your builder is illegal and void and that your builder is liable for punishment u/s 171 of GST Law.\nSection 6 : The builders are expected to pass on the benefits of lower tax burden under the GST regime to the buyers of property by way of reduced prices/ installments. It is, therefore, advised to all builders / construction companies that in the flats under construction, they should not ask customers to pay higher tax rate on instalments to be received after imposition of GST.\nSection 7: Despite this clarity on law position, if any builder resorts to such practice, the same can be deemed to be profiteering under section 171 of GST law.\nHope this information is useful."

Barring exceptional cases, the price does not provide a break-up of land cost and construction cost. \na flat under construction is neither a plot of land or a building, and hence, an effective 12% GST may not pose such a problem, when a developer collects a price, it includes the cost of land, as well. \nThe CBEC (Central Board of Excise and Customs) and states have received many complaints that in view of the works contract service tax rate under GST at 12 per cent in respect of under construction flats, complex etc, the people who have booked flats and made part payment before 1 July, 2017, are being asked to bear higher tax incidence for payments made after 1 July, 2017,\" the government informed the public through multiple forums. This is against the GST law, the government said, explaining the revised tax rules under GST, which came into effect from July 1.\n The situation has changed under GST. Under GST, full input credit is available for offsetting the headline rate of 12 per cent. As a result, the input taxes embedded in the flat will not (and should not) form a part of the cost of the flat. The input credits should take care of the headline rate of 12 per cent and it is for this reason that refund of overflow of input tax credits to the builder has been disallowed."

                "response-text": "Supreme Court of India\nJai Prakash vs M/S. National Insurance Co. & Ors on 17 December, 2009\nAuthor: R Raveendran\nBench: R.V. Raveendran, Mukundakam Sharma, K.S. Panicker Radhakrishnan\n Reportable\n IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA\n CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION\nSPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (CIVIL) No. [deleted] of 2005\nJai Prakash ....... Petitioner\nVs.\nNational Insurance Co. Ltd. & Ors. ....... Respondents\n O R D E R\nR.V. RAVEENDRAN, J.\nWe propose to address four problems frequently faced in motor accident claim cases under the\nMotor Vehicles Act, 1988 (`Act' for short).\nProblem (i)\n2. The first problem relates to a section of motor accident victims who are doubly unfortunate - first\nin getting involved in an accident, and second, in not getting any compensation. Let us elaborate.\nThere are two categories of victims in motor accidents - those who will be able to get compensation\nand those who will not be able to get compensation. Victims of motor accidents involving insured\nvehicles, who are assured of getting compensation from the insurer, fall in the first category. Victims\nof motor accidents involving the following categories of vehicles, who do not receive any\ncompensation fall under the second category:-\n (i) Hit and run vehicles which remain\n unidentified.\n (ii) Vehicles which do not have any insurance\n cover.\n (iii) Vehicles with third party insurance,\nJai Prakash vs M/S. National Insurance Co. & Ors on 17 December, 2009\ncarrying persons who are not covered by the insurance (gratuitous passengers in a goods vehicle or a\ncar, and pillion riders on two wheelers etc.) In hit and run cases, the victim has no one from whom\nhe can claim or get compensation. In regard to vehicles which do not have any insurance or do not\nhave an insurance covering the risks relating to gratuitous passengers/riders, even if the\ndriver/owner may be made liable under an award of the Tribunal, there is little or no chance of\nrecovery of compensation that may be awarded. This is because normally driver and owners of\nuninsured vehicles will not have the capacity to pay the compensation or would have transferred\ntheir assets to escape paying compensation. It is estimated that around 20% of the victims of motor\naccidents fall under the unfortunate categories who do not get any compensation (except some who\nmay get a token amount under Section 161 or 140 of the Act). A person hit by an uninsured vehicle,\nfeels frustrated, cheated and discriminated, when he does not get any compensation, but sees\nanother person hit by an insured vehicle getting compensation. The victim does not choose the\nvehicle which hits him, nor any role in causing the accident. But a victim is denied compensation, if\nthe vehicle which hits disappears without trace, or if the vehicle is without insurance, while a similar\nvictim hit by an insured vehicle gets compensation. Should the State, which by law provided for\ncompulsory third party insurance to protect motor accident victims, ignore these 20% victims who\ndo not get compensation or provide them with some effective remedy? Should the State go\nsomething to reduce the incidence of non-insurance?\nProblem (ii)\n3. The second problem relates to the widespread practice of using goods vehicles for passenger\ntraffic. Such use is primarily due to the following four reasons:\n(a) Non-availability of regular mode of passenger transport in several parts of the country,\nparticularly in rural areas, compelling people to use lorries and other goods vehicles as modes of\ntransport to reach their destinations.\n(b) Non-availability of contract carriages for group travel during special occasions. Consequently,\nlarge groups of people use, again mostly in rural areas, goods vehicles (lorries and tractor-trailers)\nfor group travel on occasions like marriages, festivals, functions and political rallies.\n(c) Frequent break-down of buses/cars/other vehicles (on roads with sparse traffic) due to bad\nmaintenance of roads or the vehicles, or other emergencies forcing the stranded passengers to use\ngoods vehicles to reach nearest city or town from which they can get regular recognized modes of\ntransport.\n(d) The temptation of lorry drivers to make a quick buck by carrying passengers for a fare (with or\nwithout the knowledge of the owner) coupled with the attraction of a low fare for the poor and\nneedy. (These passengers though termed as `gratuitous' passengers, except in a few cases, are fare\npaying illegal passengers).\nWhere persons travel in a goods vehicle either knowing or not knowing that such travel is illegal\n(gratuitously or by paying an illegal `fare' to the driver or owner) and such the vehicle is involved in\nJai Prakash vs M/S. National Insurance Co. & Ors on 17 December, 2009\nan accident resulting in injuries to such passengers, various legal and moral questions arise.\nWhether the victims are entitled to compensation? Whether the insurer is liable? Whether the\nowner, who may be unaware of such illegal carriage by the driver, can be made liable? Whether the\nowner and driver of goods vehicles should be made liable to pay compensation, even where they\nwere carrying passengers stranded on the road, gratuitously only out of sympathy ? Whether\n`illegal' passengers should be denied compensation as a deterrent to discourage unauthorized\ntravel? Should we ignore the harsh reality that as long as the causes necessitating or forcing people\nto resort to such illegal travel in goods vehicles continue to exist, people will continue to travel in\ngoods vehicles, unmindful of the risk, whether legal or illegal? Problem (iii)\n4. The third problem relates to the procedural delays in adjudication/settlement of claims by Motor\nAccidents Claims Tribunals (for short `Tribunals') and consequential hardship to the victims and\ntheir families. In cases where the accident victim dies, the family - usually the widow and children -\nloses its sole bread winner and are virtually driven to the streets. Many a time, the widow and\nchildren are forced to take up unaccustomed manual labour for their survival, the children foregoing\ntheir education. Payment of compensation without delay will help them to sustain themselves and\npick up the threads to live with dignity. 4.1) Most of the accident victims (who are injured) are not\nable to access quality medical treatment for want of funds, as their earning capacity is either\npermanently lost or is put on hold on account of the injuries. They get the compensation only after\nthe treatment and after a contested trial. Many a time lack of treatment or inadequate treatment for\nwant of funds, itself converts what could have been a temporary disability into permanent disability\nfor the victim, thereby increasing the compensation payable. The Insurance Companies know full\nwell that timely payment of compensation or timely better treatment of the victims can ultimately\nreduce the quantum of compensation payable by them. The insurance companies also know that\nthey will have to ultimately reimburse the cost of medical treatment of the accident victim with\ninterest. But still they fail to extend timely aid to the injured victims, but wait for the injured to file a\nclaim petition, after completing the treatment at his own cost.\n4.2) The Legislature tried to reduce the period of pendency of claim cases and quicken the process of\ndetermination of compensation by making two significant changes in the Act, by Amendment Act 54\nof 1994, making it mandatory for registration of a motor accident claim within one month of receipt\nof first information of the accident, without the claimants having to file a claim petition. Sub-section\n(6) of section 158 of the Act provides:\n\"As soon as any information regarding any accident involving death or bodily injury\nto any person is recorded or report under this section is completed by a police officer,\nthe officer-in-charge of the police station shall forward a copy of the same within\nthirty days from the date of recording of information or, as the case may be, on\ncompletion of such report to the Claims Tribunal having jurisdiction and a copy\nthereof to the concerned insurer, and where a copy is made available to the owner, he\nshall also within thirty days of receipt of such report, forward the same to such\nClaims Tribunal and insurer\".\nJai Prakash vs M/S. National Insurance Co. & Ors on 17 December, 2009\nSub-section (4) of Section 166 of the Act reads thus:- \"The Claims Tribunal shall treat any report of\naccidents forwarded to it under sub-section (6) of section 158 as an application for compensation\nunder this Act\".\nRule 150 of Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989 prescribes the form (No.54) of the Police Report\nrequired to be submitted under section 158(6) of the Act. 4.3) This Court in General Insurance\nCouncil v. State of A.P. [2007 (12) SCC 354] emphasised the need for implementing the aforesaid\nprovisions. This Court directed:\n\"It is, therefore, directed that all the State Governments and the Union Territories\nshall instruct all police officers concerned about the need to comply with the\nrequirement of Section 158(6) keeping in view the requirement indicated in Rule 150\nand in Form 54, Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989. Periodical checking shall be\ndone by the Inspector General of Police concerned to ensure that the requirements\nare being complied with. In case there is non-compliance, appropriate action shall be\ntaken against the erring officials. The Department of Road Transport and Highways\nshall make periodical verification to ensure that action is being taken and in case of\nany deviation immediately bring the same to the notice of the State\nGovernments/Union Territories concerned so that necessary action can be taken\nagainst the officials concerned.\"\n4.4) But unfortunately neither the police nor the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunals have made any\neffort to implement these mandatory provisions of the Act. If these provisions are faithfully and\neffectively implemented, it will be possible for the victims of accident and/or their families to get\ncompensation, in a span of few months. There is, therefore, an urgent need for the concerned police\nauthorities and Tribunals to follow the mandate of these provisions.\nProblem (iv)\n5. Courts have always been concerned that the full compensation amount does not reach and benefit\nthe victims and their families, particularly those who are uneducated, ignorant, or not worldly-wise.\nUnless there are built-in safeguards they may be deprived of the benefit of compensation which may\nbe the sole source of their future sustenance. This court has time and again insisted upon measures\nto ensure that the compensation amount is appropriately invested and protected and not frittered\naway owing to ignorance, illiteracy and susceptibility to exploitation. [See Union Carbide\nCorporation v. Union of India - 1991 (4) SCC 584 and General Manager, Kerala State Road\nTransport Corporation v. Susamma Thomas - 1994 (2) SCC 176]. But in spite of the directions in\nthese cases, the position continues to be far from unsatisfactory and in many cases unscrupulous\nrelatives, agents and touts are taking away a big chunk of the compensation, by ingenious methods.\nReports of Amicus Curiae\n6. In this background, to find some solutions, on 9.9.2008, this Court requested Shri Gopal\nSubramaniam, to assist the Court as Amicus Curiae. The learned amicus curiae with his usual\nthoroughness and commitment has examined the issues and submitted a series of reports and has\nJai Prakash vs M/S. National Insurance Co. & Ors on 17 December, 2009\nalso made several suggestions for consideration. He has also referred to and relied on a series of\nzealous directions issued by a learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court to expedite and\nstreamline the adjudication of motor vehicle claims and disbursement of compensation.\n7. Having considered the nature of the problems and taking note of the several suggestions made by\nthe learned Amicus Curiae and after hearing, we propose to issue a set of directions to the police\nauthorities and Claims Tribunals. We also propose to make some suggestions for implementation by\nInsurance Companies and some suggestions for the consideration of the Parliament and the Central\nGovernment.\nDirections to Police Authorities\n8. The Director General of Police of each State is directed to instruct all Police Stations in his State\nto comply with the provisions of Section 158(6) of the Act. For this purpose, the following steps will\nhave to be taken by the Station House Officers of the jurisdictional police stations:\n(i) Accident Information Report in Form No. 54 of the Central Motor Vehicle Rules,1989 (`AIR' for\nshort) shall be submitted by the police (Station House Officer) to the jurisdictional Motor Vehicle\nClaims Tribunal, within 30 days of the registration of the FIR. In addition to the particulars required\nto be furnished in Form No. 54, the police should also collect and furnish the following additional\nparticulars in the AIR to the Tribunal: (i) The age of the victims at the time of accident; (ii) The\nincome of the victim; (iii) The names and ages of the dependent family members.\n(ii) The AIR shall be accompanied by the attested copies of the FIR, site\nsketch/mahazar/photographs of the place of occurrence, driving licence of the driver, insurance\npolicy (and if necessary, fitness certificate) of the vehicle and postmortem report (in case of death)\nor the Injury/Wound certificate (in the case of injuries). The names/addresses of injured or\ndependant family members of the deceased should also be furnished to the Tribunal.\n(iii) Simultaneously, copy of the AIR with annexures thereto shall be furnished to the concerned\ninsurance company to enable the Insurer to process the claim.\n(iv) The police shall notify the first date of hearing fixed by the Tribunal to the victim (injured) or\nthe family of the victim (in case of death) and the driver, owner and insurer. If so directed by the\nTribunal, the police may secure their presence on the first date of hearing.\n9. To avoid any administrative difficulties in immediate implementation of sections 158(6) of the\nAct, we permit such implementation to be carried out in three stages. In the first stage, all police\nstations/claims Tribunals in the NCT Region and State Capital regions shall implement the\nprovisions by end of April 2010. In the second stage, all the police stations/claims Tribunals in\ndistrict headquarters regions shall implement the provisions by the end of August 2010. In the third\nstage, all police stations/Claims Tribunals shall implement the provisions by the end of December,\n2010. The Director Generals shall ensure that necessary forms and infrastructural support is made\navailable to give effect to Section 158 (6) of the Act.\nJai Prakash vs M/S. National Insurance Co. & Ors on 17 December, 2009\n10. Section 196 of the Act provides that whoever drives a motor vehicle or causes or allows a motor\nvehicle to be driven in contravention of the provisions of Section 146 shall be punishable with\nimprisonment which may be extended to three months, or with fine which may extend to Rs.\n1000/-, or with both. Though the statute requires prosecution of the driver and owner of uninsured\nvehicles, this is seldom done. Thereby a valuable deterrent is ignored. We therefore direct the\nDirector Generals to issue instructions to prosecute drivers and owners of uninsured vehicles under\nSection 196 of the Act.\n11. The Transport Department, Health Department and other concerned departments shall extend\nnecessary co- operation to the Director-Generals to give effect to Section 158 (6).\nDirections to the Claims Tribunals\n12. The Registrar General of each High Court is directed to instruct all Claims Tribunals in his State\nto register the reports of accidents receive under Section 158 (6) of the Act as applications for\ncompensation under Section 166 (4) of the Act and deal with them without waiting for the filing of\nclaim applications by the injured or by the family of the deceased. The Registrar General shall\nensure that necessary Registers, forms and other support is extended to the Tribunal to give effect to\nSection 166 (4) of the Act.\n13. For complying with section 166(4) of the Act, the jurisdictional Motor Accident Claims Tribunals\nshall initiate the following steps:\n(a) The Tribunal shall maintain an Institution Register for recording the AIRs which are received\nfrom the Station House Officers of the Police Stations and register them as miscellaneous petitions.\nIf any private claim petitions are directly filed with reference to an AIR, they should also be recorded\nin the Register.\n(b) The Tribunal shall list the AIRs as miscellaneous petitions. It shall fix a date for preliminary\nhearing so as to enable the police to notify such date to the victim (family of victim in the event of\ndeath) and the owner, driver and insurer of the vehicle involved in the accident. Once the claimant/s\nappear, the miscellaneous application shall be converted to claim petition. Where a claimant/s file\nthe claim petition even before the receipt of the AIR by the Tribunal, the AIR may be tagged to the\nclaim petition.\n(c) The Tribunal shall enquire and satisfy itself that the AIR relates to a real accident and is not the\nresult of any collusion and fabrication of an accident (by any `Police Officer - Advocate - Doctor'\nnexus, which has come to light in several cases).\n(d) The Tribunal shall by a summary enquiry ascertain the dependent family members/legal heirs.\nThe jurisdictional police shall also enquire and submit the names of the dependent legal heirs.\n(e) The Tribunal shall categories the claim cases registered, into those where the insurer disputes\nliability and those where the insurer does not dispute the liability.\nJai Prakash vs M/S. National Insurance Co. & Ors on 17 December, 2009\n(f) Wherever the insurer does not dispute the liability under the policy, the Tribunal shall make an\nendeavour to determine the compensation amount by a summary enquiry or refer the matter to the\nLok Adalat for settlement, so as to dispose of the claim petition itself, within a time frame not\nexceeding six months from the date of registration of the claim petition.\n(g) The insurance companies shall be directed to deposit the admitted amount or the amount\ndetermined, with the claims tribunals within 30 days of determination. The Tribunals should ensure\nthat the compensation amount is kept in Fixed deposit and disbursed as per the directions\ncontained in General Manager, KSRTC v. Susamma Thomas [1994 (2) SCC 176].\n(h) As the proceedings initiated in pursuance of Section 158(6) and 166(4) of the Act, are different in\nnature from an application by the victim/s under Section 166(1) of the Act, Section 170 will not\napply. The insurers will therefore be entitled to assist the Tribunal (either independently or with the\nowners of the vehicles) to verify the correctness in regard to the accident, injuries, age, income and\ndependents of the deceased victim and in determining the quantum of compensation.\n14. The aforesaid directions to the Tribunals are without prejudice to the discretion of each Tribunal\nto follow such summary procedure as it deems fit as provided under Section 169 of the Act. Many\nTribunals instead of holding an inquiry into the claim by following suitable summary procedure, as\nmandated by Section 168 and 169 of the Act, tend to conduct motor accident cases like regular civil\nsuits. This should be avoided. The Tribunal shall take an active role in deciding and expeditious\ndisposal of the applications for compensation and make effective use of Section 165 of the Evidence\nAct, 1872, to determine the just compensation.\nSUGGESTIONS FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES\n15. In cases of death, where the liability of the insurer is not disputed, the insurance companies\nshould, without waiting for the decision of the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal or a settlement\nbefore the Lok Adalat, endeavour to pay to the family (Legal representatives) of the deceased,\ncompensation as per the standard formula determined by the decisions of this Court.\n16. In cases of injuries to any accident victim, where the liability is not disputed, the insurer should\noffer treatment at its cost to the injured, without waiting for an award of the Tribunal. If insurance\ncompanies can meet the bills for treatment of those who have taken a medical insurance policy, we\nsee no reason why they should not extend a similar treatment to the accident victims of vehicles\ninsured with them.\n17. In countries like United Kingdom, the percentage of motor accident claims, with reference to the\naccidents is very low. This is because immediately after being notified of the accident, the insurer\nmakes its own enquiries and satisfies itself about its liability and voluntarily assesses and pays the\ncompensation to the victim. Only where the insurer denies the claim or where the victim is not\nsatisfied with the quantum of compensation paid, the matter goes to court. There is no reason why\ninsurance companies in India should not adopt such a procedure. In death cases, the calculation of\ncompensation is now standardized by several decisions of this court [See for example: Sarla Verma\nJai Prakash vs M/S. National Insurance Co. & Ors on 17 December, 2009\nv. Delhi Transport Corporation - 2009 (6) SCC 121]. The insurers can either by relying upon the\npolice report (AIR) or by enquiring with the family or the employer of the deceased, ascertain the\nthree inputs required for calculation of the compensation, that is, age of the deceased, income of the\ndeceased and number of dependent family members. With these particulars, the insurers can easily\ncalculate the compensation and offer a compensation, either a lump sum or an annuity. Similarly in\ncases of injuries, the insurers can offer treatment in hospitals approved by it and meet the expenses\nor pay the bills, or if the victim has already undergone the treatment, reimburse the cost of\ntreatment. It can also reimburse other items of special damages, the damages for pain suffering,\nwhich is also standardized in several decisions of this Court. By such voluntary payment there will\nbe all round benefits. The insurers save interest and litigation cost and discharge their obligation to\nthe society. The victims will be relieved from financial hardship and benefit from timely effective\ntreatment. Burden on courts will be reduced and judicial man power can be diverted to more\ncomplex cases.\n18. To protect and preserve the compensation amount awarded to the families of the deceased\nvictim special schemes may be considered by the insurance companies in consultation with the Life\nInsurance Corporation of India, State Bank of India or any other Nationalized Banks. One proposal\nis for formulation of a scheme in consultation with Nationalized Banks under which the\ncompensation is kept in fixed deposit for an appropriate period and interest is paid by the Bank\nmonthly to the claimants without any need for claimants having to approach either the court or their\ncounsel or the Bank for that purpose. The scheme should ensure that the amount of compensation is\nutilized only for the benefit of the injured claimants or in case of death, for the benefit of the\ndependent family. We extract below the particulars of a special Scheme offered by a nationalized\nBank at the instance of the Delhi High Court :\n(i)The fixed deposit shall be automatically renewed till the period prescribed by the Court.\n(ii)The interest on the fixed deposit shall be paid monthly.\n(iii)The monthly interest shall be credited automatically in the saving account of the claimant.\n(iv)Original fixed deposit receipt shall be retained by the Bank in safe custody. However, the original\npassbook shall be given to the claimant along with the photocopy of the FDR.\n(v)The original fixed deposit receipt shall be handed over to the claimant at the end of the fixed\ndeposit period.\n(vi)Photo identity card shall be issued to the claimant and the withdrawal shall be permitted only\nafter due verification by the Bank of the identity card of the claimant.\n(vii)No cheque book shall be issued to the claimant without permission of the court.\n(viii)No loan, advance or withdrawal shall be allowed on the fixed deposit without permission of the\ncourt.\nJai Prakash vs M/S. National Insurance Co. & Ors on 17 December, 2009\n(ix)The claimant can operate the saving bank account from the nearest branch of UCO Bank and on\nthe request of the claimant, the bank shall provide the said facility.\n19. The Insurance companies may also consider offering an annuity instead of lump sum\ncompensation. They may prepare an annuity scheme with the involvement of Life Insurance\nCorporation of India or its own actuaries, under which they can pay a monthly annuity to the widow\n(for life) and to minor children (till they attain majority) and in addition a lump sum at the end of\n20 or 25 years to the widow. The benefit of such annuity scheme may also be extended to victims\nwho are permanently disabled in accidents. Once such schemes are in place, the victims and the\nTribunal will have some choice in the manner of payment of compensation.\n20. Whenever the insurance companies find that the driver of the insured vehicle possessed\nfake/forged driving license, they should lodge a complaint with the concerned police for\nprosecution. This will reduce the incidence of fake licences and increase the road travel safety.\nSUGGESTIONS FOR LEGISLATIVE/EXECUTIVE INTERVENTION\n21. We may next refer to some vital areas where intervention by the legislature and/or executive is\ncalled for. The suggestions are intended to draw the attention of the executive and legislature to the\nseveral vexed issues, which when properly and expeditiously addressed, will improve the system of\ncompensating the motor accident victims.\nEnsuring that all accident victims get compensation\n22. To ensure that all accident victims get compensation, it is necessary to formulate a more\ncomprehensive scheme for payment of compensation to victims of road accidents, in place of the\npresent system of third party insurance. For example, in South Africa and some other African\ncountries, Road Accident Funds have been created, managed by Road Accident Fund Commissions,\nthereby eliminating the need for third party insurance. A fuel levysurcharge is collected on the sale\nof petrol and diesel and credited to such fund. All accident victims, without exception, are paid\ncompensation from out of the said fund by the Commission. But the feedback from operational\nstatistics relating to such funds is that the scheme, while successful in smaller countries, may\nencounter difficulties and financial deficits in larger countries like South Africa or developing\ncountries with infrastructural deficiencies.\n23. An alternative scheme involves the collection of a one time (life time) third party insurance\npremium by a Central Insurance Agency in respect of every vehicle sold (in a manner similar to the\ncollection of life time road tax). The fund created by collection of such third party insurance can be\naugmented/supplemented by an appropriate road accident cess/surcharge on the price of\npetrol/diesel sold across the country. Such a hybrid model which involves collection of a fixed life\ntime premium in regard to each vehicle plus imposition of a road accident cess may provide a more\nsatisfactory solution in a vast country like India. This will also address a major grievance of\ninsurance companies that their outgoings by way of compensation in motor accident claims is four\ntimes the amount received as motor insurance premia. The general insurance companies may\nJai Prakash vs M/S. National Insurance Co. & Ors on 17 December, 2009\nhowever continue with optional insurance to provide cover against damage to the vehicle and injury\nto the owner.\n24. A more realistic and easier alternative is to continue with the present system of third party\ninsurance with two changes:\n(i) Define `third party' - to cover any accident victim (that is any third party, other than the owner)\nand increasing the premia, if necessary.\n(ii) Increase the quantum of compensation payable under Section 161 of the Act in case of hit and\nrun motor accidents.\n25. India has the dubious distinction of being one of the countries with the highest number of road\naccidents and the longest response time in securing first aid and medical treatment. There is\ntherefore an urgent need for laying down and enforcing Road safety measures and establishment of\nlarge number of Trauma Centres and first aid centres. It is also necessary to consider the\nestablishment of a Road Safety Bureau to lay down Road Safety Standards and norms, enforce Road\nsafety measures, establish and run Trauma Centres, establish First Aid Centres in Petrol Stations,\nand carry out research/data collection for accident prevention.\n26. Several countries have comprehensive enactments dealing exclusively with accidents. In place of\nthe provisions relating to Accident tribunals and award of compensation in the Motor Vehicles Act,\n1988, and other statutes dealing with accidents and compensation, enacting a comprehensive and\nunified statute dealing with accidents may be considered.\nRationalisation of II schedule to Motor Vehicles Act, 1988\n27. The Central Government may consider amendment of the Second Schedule to the Act to rectify\nthe several mistakes therein and rationalize the compensation payable thereunder, repeatedly\npointed out by this Court [See U.P. State Road Transport Corporation v. Trilok Chandra - 1996 (4)\nSCC 362, and Sarla Verma (supra)]. Securing the compensation to the victims of accidents involving\nuninsured vehicles\n28. Where there is no insurance cover for a vehicle, the owner should be directed to offer security or\ndeposit an amount, adequate to satisfy the award that may be ultimately passed, as a condition\nprecedent for release of the seized vehicle involved in the accident. If such security or cash deposit is\nnot made, within a period of three months, appropriate steps may be taken for disposal of the\nvehicle and hold the sale proceeds in deposit until the claim case is disposed of. The appropriate\nGovernments may consider incorporation of a rule on the lines of Rule 6 of the Delhi Motor\nAccident Claims Tribunal Rules, 2008 in this behalf.\nCONSEQUENTIAL DIRECTIONS\nJai Prakash vs M/S. National Insurance Co. & Ors on 17 December, 2009\n29. The Supreme Court Registry is directed to send copies of this order to (i) Chief Secretaries and\nDirector Generals of Police of all States, and (ii) Registrar-Generals of all High Courts, for\ncompliance with the directions. The suggestions made may be placed before the Central\nGovernment by the learned Solicitor General. Registry may receive and put up any other\nsuggestions. List for further directions on 7.1.2010.\n____________________J.\n(R V Raveendran) ____________________J.\n (Mukundakam Sharma)\nNew Delhi; ____________________J.\nDecember 17, 2009. (K.S.

During divorce or marriage annulment proceedings, the issue of child custody often becomes a matter for the court to determine. In most cases, both parents continue to share legal child custody but one parent gains physical child custody. Family law courts generally base decisions on the best interests of the child or children, not always on the best arguments of each parent.\nIn general, courts tend to award PHYSICAL child custody to the parent who demonstrates the most financial security, adequate parenting skills and the least disruption for the child. Both parents continue to share legal child custody until the minor has reached the age of 18 or becomes legally emancipated. Legal custody means that either parent can make decisions which affect the welfare of the child, such as medical treatments, religious practices and insurance claims. Physical child custody means that one parent is held primarily responsible for the child's housing, educational needs and food. In most cases, the non-custodial parent still has visitation rights. \nThus you can prepare the grounds accordingly."

If divorce is inevitable, bitter battles cannot be the option to settle issues of child custody and access. Parental rights are the legal obligations and responsibilities that a parent has for their child. Failing to fulfill the needful duties result in child abuse or neglect, thereby terminating the parental rights legally. But neglecting duties in India is hardly a matter to be considered as enough for terminating parental rights. Termination can be voluntarily or involuntarily, and for various reasons. However, here our concern is to deal with parental rights after divorce.\nAs per the law until the child completes 5 years the mother has the every right to keep the child in her custody and it cannot be challenged unless there exists certain essential grounds which may affect the welfare of the child. The non-negotiable principle on which custody is decided is the 'best interest and welfare of the child'. Who will best serve the child's emotional, educational, social and medical needs is the only criteria.\nthe essential grounds for getting a divorce.\n1.\tAdultery \u2013 as alleged \n2.\tImpotency \u2013 as alleged\n3.\tHarassments from the in-laws\n4.\tCo-habitation not done repeated demands \nThe entire above are leads to cruelty. Acts of cruelty are behavioral manifestations stimulated by different factors in the life of spouses, and their surroundings and therefore, each case has to be decided on the basis of its own set of facts. Mental cruelty can consist of unusually callous, neglectful and deliberately harass conduct, false accusation of adultery or unchastity, false charge of impotency, undue familiarity with third person, deprivation of property, drunkenness, false criminal charge by one spouse against the other, reprehensible conduct, refusal to have marital intercourse, refusal to consummate marriage, communication of disease, demand for dowry etc\nIf you think to divorce then file a case for divorce under the ground cruelty.Other wise settle the matter amicably with the help of close relatives.And consult a marriage counselor or physcatrist"

The next question to be considered is from what point of time the period of limitation begins to run in the case of an application under Section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Only the residuary Article, Article 137 of the Limitation Act applies to an application under Section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Article 137 reads as follows :\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDescription of application Period of Time from which period\n limitation begins to run\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n137. Any other application Three years When the right to apply\nfor which no period of accrues.\nlimitation is provided\nelsewhere in this division.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n14. The time begins to run under Article 137 when the right to apply accrues. The right to apply to set aside a sale accrues from the date of sale. Even in the case of setting aside the sale, Article 127 provides for running of the period of limitation from the date of sale. Date of confirmation of sale or the date of making the application for delivery are irrelevant for the purpose of Article 127.When the prayer in the application under Section 47 is to declare that the sale is invalid or void, necessarily the right to apply accrues from the date of sale. In the present case, the sale was held on 18.12.2002 and it was confirmed on 20.2.2003. The application under Section 47 CPC was filed beyond the period of three years from this case. The contention put forward by the learned counsel for the petitioners that at every point of time when delivery is attempted, a fresh cause of action arises to enable the petitioners to apply under Section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure cannot be accepted at all. If such contention is accepted, a judgment debtor would be entitled to protract the proceedings and there would be no finality to the execution proceedings, the execution, sale and delivery of the property. Therefore, I am not inclined to accept the contention put forward by the learned counsel for the petitioners that the application was filed within time. In the admitted factual situation, even assuming that an application under Section 47 was maintainable, it was not filed by the petitioners within time and the application was barred by limitation.\n\u00a0\nEven in this Civil Revision Petition, attempts were made by a learned Single Judge of this Court to settle the disputes between the parties. The case was adjourned on several dates to enable the parties to settle the case. Even the parties were called to the chambers of the learned Single Judge and an attempt was made to settle the case. All the attempts made to settle the case were futile. For the aforesaid reasons, the Civil Revision Petition is dismissed. However, there will be no order as to costs."

This means that, according to the Supreme Court's interpretation, there is no specific time limit within which an application under Section 47 must be filed.\u00a0\nArticle 137 of the Limitation Act:\nArticle 137 of the Limitation Act provides a general limitation period of three years for any application for which no period of limitation is provided elsewhere in the Act. It acts as a residual provision for cases not covered by specific limitation periods.\u00a0\nNow, regarding your specific case:\u00a0\n(1) Conflict between Section 47 and Article 137: While the Supreme Court has held that there is no specific limitation for Section 47 applications, Article 137 provides a general three-year limitation period for applications where no specific period is prescribed elsewhere. There doesn't seem to be an inherent conflict between the two. The absence of a specific limitation period in Section 47 could mean that Article 137 would apply as the general rule.\u00a0\n(2) Application Filed by JD: In your case, the JD has filed an application under Section 47, arguing that the decree is not enforceable due to a settlement, which you believe is fraudulent, and it's also barred by limitation under Article 137.\u00a0\nHere's how it typically works:\u00a0If there's no specific limitation period prescribed for Section 47 applications, Article 137's three-year limitation may apply.However, the application's specific circumstances, such as fraudulent compromise and other legal arguments, would also be considered.To resolve the issue of limitation, the court will likely examine whether the application under Section 47 was filed within a reasonable time considering all the facts and circumstances. The court will assess the merits of the arguments presented in the application, including the claim of fraudulent compromise."

Booked in 2010 July, the agreement mentions the delivery commitment as \" 36 months +- 6 months, from the date of start of excavation / signing of agreement\". I does not mention anything about whichever is earlier or later. The agreement was signed in September 2010 and excavation work for my tower started in Jan 2012. I have not been given the possession yet, since 2013 December I have been getting assurance of possession in next 3 to 4 months. Amrapali has given possession to many people in the society but few towers are not yet delivered. People are staying in other towers since 2014 mid. I was later in 2014 informed that my tower is in phase 2 delivery (but there is no such phase 2 mentioned in agreement). Actually my towers is almost ready for the last 2 years but there is no progress in it since the last 2 years (approx). And my flat has been made ready completely with tiles and interior work done, and is being used by Amrapali for their office purpose (the facility management office for society). I have raised my objection to my flat being used by others and have requested that if my flat is ready I should be given possession. I am as of now paying rent and also paying EMI. Builder is also not paying any late payment charges as of now, and saying it would be settled at the time of possession.\r\nHave below queries in this regards:\r\n1. Is my case legally strong enough / genuine enough for claiming the late payment charges from builder. And is the late payment charge settled at the time of possession only, no provision of getting the late charges as and when the payment is delayed?\r\n2. Builder has also charged me on some late payments, I tried to ask for the exact amount of late payment so that I can settle it, but they said it would be settled at the time of possession, I believe they are trying to negotiate during possession for my late payment amount to their project delay. What could / should be my step on this, to avoid falling in any of builders trap.\r\n3. Can I claim additional rent / amount under any other head from builder for using my flat for their office purpose.\r\n4. I have been coordinating with an employee of builder over emails for all these follow-ups, I do not have any of their managements correspondence, is it required to make the case strong.\r\n5. Can I approach the court, if yes, which court, and what do I need to prepare for.",

The time mentioned on the Agreement for the full and final payment by Mr. A and execution of the sale deed was 31/oct/2018. Now some facts:-\r\n1) Full amount mentioned in the agreement has not been paid till 31/oct/2018 even after various reminders.\r\n2) Till 31/oct/2018 whatever payments made were done by some third parties not mentioned in the agreement nor known to the sellers and were remitted in the accounts of Mr.B & his 2 sons\r\n3) 3 Legal notices were sent to Mr.A by the seller through his lawyer but they returned due to untraceable address of Mr A.\r\n4) The legal notices mentioned the cancellation of the agreement to sale as well as payments by the third parties.\r\n5) In furtherence to this three public notices in national newspapers were also published through the lawyer of the seller Mr. B for any claim towards the property or the payments .\r\n6) Neither Mr.A(buyer) nor any of the third parties has ever turned up till date in respect of any claim.\r\n7) During the period seller Mr.B expired in September 2019, leaving behind his 2 sons.\r\nNow my query and question are as follows:-\r\n1. Is the agreement to sell valid and legal.\r\n2. As the buyer Mr.A nor the third parties ever approached the sellers will this agreement stands cancelled.\r\n3. Can the 2 surviving sons of Mr. B sell the property to new buyer after the public & legal notices.\r\n4. Can the buyer Mr. A or third parties approach the courts on any ground for specific relief.\r\n5. What about the refund policy of the amount paid by third parties.( Can they still claim )",

Therefore the very fact that\na) Seller had issued legal notices (which were returned unserved) and\u00a0\nb) Seller issuing paper publication in news paper\u00a0\u00a0\nmeans that the seller has taken all steps to rescind/cancel the agreement and as such the Seller is under NO LEGAL OBLIGATION to execute the sale deed.\u00a0\n3) Given that much time has elapsed (i.e 22 months from date of agreement to sell) and buyer has not come forward to perform his part of contract, the 2 surviving sons of the seller can proceed to sell the property to a new buyer without any further notices to previous buyer.\n4) Courts will not grant order in favour of previous buyer even if the previous buyer approaches the court for relief under specific relief act as buyer has miserably failed to perform his part of contract despite passage of 22 months.\u00a0\n5) In law, even unserved postal notices are valid and added to the fact that paper publication has also been issued cancelling the agreement.\n6)Refund policy- The seller may retain upto 75% of payment received and may return up to 25% of the money paid by buyer, provided the buyer approaches the seller.\u00a0 Third parties cannot make any claim to the seller as they are not parties to the contract(agreement to sell dated [deleted] and doctrine of privity of contract will strictly prohibit the third parties to make any claims against the seller.\u00a0\nHope\u00a0 this information is useful."

Interestingly, GPA is revocable or can even be terminated at any time unless made irrevocable in a manner known to law.\nGPA is Not Irrevocable\nThe law is that even if the parties have determined that the GPA is irrevocable it won\u2019t have the effect of transferring title to the grantee. Thus, in totality GPA does not convey ownership of the buyer; however, a GPA holder may execute a deed of conveyance in exercise of the power granted under the power of attorney and convey title on behalf of the grantor.\nTaking the judgment from the Supreme of India into consideration it\u2019s a settled law now that immovable property can be legally and lawfully transferred or conveyed only by a registered deed of conveyance and not through GPA. Thus, as GPA does not conclude complete transaction, the Supreme Court parties should consider registering the deed of conveyance.\nThe Supreme Court in the case had however, observed that GPA transactions may also be used to obtain specific performance or to defend possession under section 53A of Transfer of Property Act, 1882."

If loss under the head \u201cCapital gains\u201d incurred during a year cannot be adjusted in the same year, then unadjusted capital loss can be carried forward to next year.\n5) In the subsequent year(s), such loss can be adjusted only against income chargeable to tax under the head \u201cCapital gains\u201d, however, long-term capital loss can be adjusted only against long-term capital gains. Short-term capital loss can be adjusted against long-term capital gains as well as short-term capital gains.\n6) Such loss can be carried forward for eight years (8 Assessment years) immediately succeeding the year in which the loss is incurred.\n7) Such loss can be can carried forward only if the return of income/loss of the year in which loss is incurred is furnished on or before the due date of furnishing the return, as prescribed under section 139(1). \n8) Mandatory Filing of IT return in order to carry forward and set-off of a loss in stipulated time\n9) As per section 80 of Income tax act, the assesses must have filed a return of loss under section 139(3) in order to carry forward and set off a loss. In other words, the non-filing of a return of loss disentitles the assesses from carrying forward the loss sustained by him. Such a return should filed within the time allowed under section 139(1).\nHope this helps."

In 2007 my SIL `s marriage was fixed up. My MIL and SIL demanded a Honda city car for her marriage. I resisted the same. My SIL came back from her matrimonial home on 3 rd day of marriage and lodged dowry harassment against her husband for demanding an Honda City. I was blamed for breaking up her marriage as my parents had not gifted her a honda city car. She told her parents to stop giving me food from the only kitchen in home. I was left with 2 kids and no food. I shifted to my parents. \r\nIn 2008, after counselling by police, my husband took a separate house. On first day , he left me at my parents promising to pick me and kids up at night. However when he did not turn up, I called him up. His sister picked the phone and told me to deposit copensation for breaking her marriage into her account , or she will break my marriage . Same night I was thrown out by my husband. \r\nis this not dowry harassment. Any judgements will be helpful.",

She sent her passport copies, OIC, and photo all self attested by mail along with a letter describing her sinking condition and that she was hospitalized and cannot move. The Bank Manager insisted to get the KYC documents attested by the Indian Embassy in Switzerland and to execute a Power of Attorney in favor of her relative in India attested by the Indian Embassy. \r\nThe Indian Embassy or any other offices were not working and travel was banned in addition the cancer patient was unable to move out and attestation impossible. The condition of Power of Attorney was irrelevant as she didnot suggest anybody to operate the account on her behalf. She offered to come to a video chat with the Bank Manager in her registered phone number and arrange to identify her by one or more previous Bank Managers of the same branch and by existing employees of the Branch. Branch Manager denied the suggestion which caused acute mental harrassement to the patient and in utter mental agony the lady met with an early death. \r\nPl advise whether the Bank Official is liable for mental harassement to the lady cancer patient for imposing impossible and irrelevent terms and denied natural justice to her.

The actions of the Bank Manager in this case seem to have caused undue hardship and mental harassment to the NRI depositor lady. However, to determine whether or not the Bank Manager is liable for his actions, it would depend on the specific circumstances and facts of the case, as well as the relevant laws and regulations in India.\nUnder Indian law, mental harassment is considered a form of cruelty, which is a criminal offense under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code. However, whether or not the Bank Manager's actions in this case would constitute mental harassment under this provision would need to be determined by a court of law.\nAdditionally, banks in India are required to comply with the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Know Your Customer (KYC) guidelines, which require them to obtain and verify customer identification data, and to periodically update their customer identification records. These guidelines are intended to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing, and failure to comply with these guidelines can result in penalties and other regulatory action.\nIn this case, it may be possible to take legal action against the Bank Manager for his actions if it can be proven that he was acting in bad faith, and that his actions caused harm to the NRI depositor lady. It may be advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in banking law to determine the appropriate legal recourse in this situation."

I again spoke to them & they said my vehicle isn't sold yet, I objected strongly & told them to solve this issue & stop using it for their personal usage, they said that within 1 week my name will be cleared from it, but after 3 weeks also it is still showing vehicle on my name only.\r\nPlease provide me guidance on this, what legally or Formally I need to have or talk about to these guys ?

He can also increase the rent at the rate of 15 per cent per annum for improvements and alterations provided 70 per cent tenants consent in writing. The landlord can also increase rent at 25 per cent per annum for special or structural repairs, exclusive of any repairs carried out under the Maharashtra Housing & Area Development Authority (MHADA) Act. He can also increase rent due to any increase in taxes.\n2.) According to the Act, every landlord shall be bound to keep the premises in good and tenantable repair. If he neglects to make any repairs, within a reasonable time after a notice of fifteen days is served upon him by post or in any other manner by a tenant or jointly by tenants interested in such repairs, such tenant or tenants may themselves make the same and deduct the expenses of such repairs from the rent or otherwise recover them from the landlord. Provided further that, the amount so deducted or recoverable in any year shall not exceed one-fourth of the rent payable by the tenant for that year.\n3.) Section 16 (1) (I) of the Act provides that the landlord may recover possession subject to the provisions of section 25. Section 25 states that a landlord shall be entitled to recover possession of any premises if the court is satisfied that the premises are reasonably and required bona fide by the landlord.\nThe landlord can also recover possession of the premises if the tenant has, without the landlord\u2019s consent given in writing, erected on the premises any permanent structure. Also if the tenant, his agent, servant, persons inducted by tenant or claiming under the tenant or, any person residing with the tenant has been guilty of conduct which is a nuisance or annoyance to the adjoining or neighboring occupier, or has been convicted of using the premises or allowing the premises to be used for immoral or illegal purposes.\n4.) The landlord, however, will have to give certain undertakings as mentioned in sub-section 6. These are:\n\u2022 He/she must have sufficient funds to carry out the work\n\u2022 The plans of the proposed buildings be prepared and approved by the municipal authorities prior to tendering the request for vacation\n\u2022 The number of residential tenements in the new building should not less than the number of residential tenements in the old building\n\u2022 The carpet area of different premises let in the old building must be the same as in the new building\n\u2022 The landlord gives an undertaking that the carpet area of different premises let in the new building will be the same as was let in the old building; the premises in the new building will be offered to the tenants of the old building;\n\u2022 The work of demolition of the old building will be completed within three months and the new building will be completed in 15 months thereafter.\nHowever, under the Maharashtra Rent Control Act 1999 the requirement of prior procurement of a tribunal certificate has been dispensed with and the responsibility now rests with the court to ensure that the tenants will neither be unnecessarily harassed nor evicted.\n5.) Section 55 of the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999, provides that any agreement for leave and license or letting of any premises, entered into between the landlord and the tenant or the licensee, as the case may be, after the commencement of this Act, shall be in writing and shall be registered under the Registration Act, 1908. The responsibility of getting such agreement registered shall be on the landlord and in the absence of the written registered agreement, the contention of the tenant about the terms and conditions subject to which a premises have been given to him by the landlord on leave and license or have been let to him, shall prevail, unless proved otherwise. Any landlord who contravenes the provisions of this section shall, on conviction, be punished with imprisonment which may extend to three months or with fine not exceeding rupees five thousand or with both.\nUnder Section 55(1) it is clear that only the agreement of tenancy or leave and license executed between the landlord and tenant or the landlord and the licensee is required registration."

        "query-text": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am from Delhi, age 30 now ... No dv,,  no fir ,, no 498a or any case on me yet.\r\n\r\nand below is my case in detail.\r\n\r\nMarried in November 2013, started facing troubles after one month itself. Trouble was that wife was very kiddish in daily activities and behavior was not at all of that of a mature adult.\r\n\r\nDaily problems started growing ,, like absolute lack of intelligence,, extra low IQ ,, soon I found out that she severely lacked basic daily life skills ,,even so low that tasks related to buying groceries ,, doing simple calculations etc was impossible for her. We went for a diagnosis in a hospital and was found that her IQ was low and her brain was that of a teenager while she was aged 26. In bed also she was extremely kiddish and did not understand what an intimate relationship between a husband and a wife is, our relationship was so cold and dead ,,there was no bond of any sort at all,, however she was very sweet and polite and we never had any sort of quarell at all. Absolutely zero fights between us,, but there was no relationship from day 1 ,, she did not have the mental capacity to get into the role of wife,,, for her the role of a wife is just making food and asking how I am ,, nothing beyond that,,,, . The hospital diagnose happened in April 2014. There are many incidents that disappointed me and made me take this step,,but I can't recall all of them right now.\r\n\r\nAfter the diagnose things started to heat up. We daily requested her parents to take her back but they refused convincing me that she will get better by time and all.. It was very tough to spend a day with her,, how would I spend my entire life with her ? So in October 2014 (11 months after marriage) she had to go for around 10 days with her family to a holiday, so when she came back and asked me to come to take her back home ,,, I said that I have made up my mind and let's end this marriage.\r\n\r\nThen she and her family agreed and immediately within 2 weeks or so asked to sit down for mutual settlement. They started with demands of 2 crore to give us a mental shock and told me that wife is pregnant,, later got her aborted without my consent. Because she is not mentally that mature ,,,and her parents also agree to that and I have recordings of her mom and her of agreeing to that ,, they don't let her talk to me ,, they just come on the phone themselves.\r\n\r\nSince end of 2014 till march 2016,, numerous meetings were held for mutual settlement but nothing could be finalized. Meetings were both cold and hot,, calm and abusive, but only orally.. No physical abuse,, however once her lawyer and his entire team tried to intimidate me by becoming aggressive in his office ,,, that's why now I don't do any effort of calling them,, .. I personally feel that their lawyer is very sick and very anti peaceful-settlement. But till now no case has been done on me,, which makes me feel happy but also worried at the same time about what are they planning... , just one false complaint they did in police station on October last week 2014 (the first meeting when they came for settlement) ,, in that complaint she said that I demanded 15 lakhs and beat her. But police never came to me or called me in police station.\r\n\r\nI have consulted few free and paid lawyers in the past who have given good tips but have not been able to find that ONE Lawyer who could make me enter this dark tunnel and guide me to the end ,,, all seem so scared in one way or the other for fighting from a guy side ,,, and some seemed fishy as of they were on her side. I am yet to have 100% confidence on one lawyer who could guide me with information,, I can't follow anyone blind folded.\r\n\r\nAm sorry to all lawyers reading this as they might find my words foul but am just speaking out of experience, nothing else\r\n\r\nIts going to be 2 years now, I want to get done with this by any way and am ready for an amicable settlement but would leave it to you experts to help me in the case... But am not tired ,,, nor have I lost my patience and nor do I feel weak in any way,, I have been cheated with and that is enough as a reason to stand up and fight,, but let's leave emotions aside for now. Looking forward for solution to my problem.\r\n\r\nI have seen lawyers here replying very well to people's questions and thus I have started to grow slight confidence on this platform. I will be happy to see a reply which is well detailed and full of knowledge as the game is still because there are no cases on me. I have very large amounts of audio and video recordings proving my innocence on every case that she can put. I know the consequences of filing the divorce first and am not scared to face them given I have a good lawyer with me. Looking forward to build a solid legal relationship here regarding all matters of life ,, property,, business,, taxation,, govt related ,,, etc.. So kindly consider this as a relationship opportunity and not just a question.\r\n\r\nThank you",

And there was 1.5 acres of kumki land apart from that. After an year a friend of our neighbour came for settling in our village. And he wanted to have some land for the money he had. My father was a person who help anyone, so, he offered him an acre of land from the land we had. \r\n\r\nBut, recently(I mean, around 7 years back from now) we were financially bit troubled. By taking the advantage of this, our new neighbour legalized the complete kumki land(1.5 acres) in his name.

Important requirement is the mutual consent of the husband & wife. There are two aspects on which Husband & Wife have to reach to consensus. One is the alimony or maintenance issues. As per Law there is no minimum or maximum limit of maintenance. It could be any figure or no figure. Next important consideration is the Child Custody.

This time span is provided to the couple so that they get time to reconsider their marriage.

If the divorce file is not withdrawn within 18 months,the court passes a divorce decree. In case one of the sides withdraws the petition,the court initiates to make an enquiry.

At the time of filing his income tax returns, the tax payer had claimed a deduction under section 54F of the Income Tax Act (\u2018the Act\u2019) on the ground that the sale proceeds were invested in the acquisition of a residential home in the joint names of himself and his wife. Section 54F of the Act provides that if a tax payer invests the sale proceeds received from the sale of any capital asset for buying a residential property; the long-term capital gains on sale of the property would be exempt.\nthe High Court observed that for the purposes of section 54F, the new residential house need not be purchased by the tax payer in his own name nor is it necessary that it should be purchased exclusively in his name. The High Court further observed that the assessee in the said case has not purchased the new house in the name of a stranger or somebody who is unconnected with him. The same has been purchased only in the name of his wife. The fact that the entire investment for the house has come out of the sale proceeds and that there was no contribution from the assessee\u2019s wife is undisputed. In view of the same, the High Court allowed the exemption from long-term capital gains in favour of the tax payer.\nThis clearly indicates the the exemption can be claimed even in the jointly purchased property.\nIt may be noted that section 54F of the Act requires that in order to claim exemption, the residential house should be purchased by the tax payer, but does not stipulate that the house should be purchased in the name of the tax payer only. Including wife\u2019s name in the property for any other social / economic reasons should not stand in the way of exemption granted by the said provision of the Act. These sections promote impetus to house construction and as long as this purpose is served; other factors should not matter."

The AWBI filed an appeal against this order, which has now been disposed of by the court. Although these Rules have been challenged before the High Court of Delhi, the Madras High Court, and the Supreme Court of India because of the vested interests of breeders and pet shops, no interim stay has been granted to the petitioners, and the provisions of the Rules remain in force. In fact, the challenge to the 2017 Rules before the Rajasthan High Court was dismissed in May 2018.\n\u00a0performing these procedures is therefore a punishable offence.

                "response-text": "Dear Sir,\nThe following information may kindly be read:\nRelation of Partners with One Another\nAll partners are free to form their own terms and conditions with respect to functioning in their partnership deed. The Indian Partnership Act, 1932 has also prescribed provisions to govern their relationship\u00a0inter se\u00a0(amongst them), and these provisions are applicable if no such deed exists. Let us take a look at the duties and the rights of partners.\nRight to Determine\u00a0Relationship\nPartners can determine their mutual rights and duties by a contract called partnership deed, which determines aspects of general administration, such as which partner will do what work, what will be their share in profits, etc. It may be varied by express or implied consent of all the partners.\nSuch deed can be expressly made or implied by a course of dealing.\u00a0For example, if one partner checks accounts of the firm daily and others do not object, his conduct will be presumed to be a right of all partners in the absence of a written partnership deed between them. So they can themselves determine the rights of partners.\n\u00a0\nAgreement in Restraint of Trade is Valid\nSection 27 of the Indian Contracts Act, 1872 declares contracts in restraint of trade as void. All agreements restraining exercise of a lawful profession, trade or business are invalid.\nSection 11 of Partnership Act, however, states that partners can validly levy such a restraint on each other, but such restraint must be provided for under the partnership deed. Partners can use this agreement to prohibit each other from carrying on any business other than that of the firm.\nRights of Partners\u00a0Inter Se\nPartners can exercise the following rights under the Act unless the partnership deed states otherwise:\n\nRight to participate in business:\u00a0Each partner has an equal right to take part in the conduct of their business. Partners can curtail this right to allow only some of them to contribute to the functioning of the business if the partnership deed states so.\nRight to express opinions:\u00a0Another one of the rights of partners is their right to freely express their opinion.\u00a0Partners, by a majority, can determine differences with respect to ordinary matters connected with the business. Each partner can express his opinion to decide such matters.\nRight to access books and accounts:\u00a0Each partner can inspect and copy books of accounts of the business. This right is applicable equally to active and dormant partners.\nRight to share profits:\u00a0Partners generally describe in their deed the proportion in which they will share profits of the firm. However, they have to share all the profits of the firm equally if they have not agreed on a fixed profit sharing ratio.\nRight to be indemnified:\u00a0Partners can make some payments and incur liabilities through their decisions in the course of their business. They can claim indemnity from each other for these decisions. Such decisions must be taken in situations of emergency and should be of such nature that an ordinarily prudent person would resort to under similar conditions.\nRight to interest on capital and advances:\u00a0Partners generally do not get an\u00a0interest on the capital they contribute. In case they decide to take an interest, such payment must be made only out of profits. They can, however, receive interest of 6% p.a. for other advances made subsequently towards the business.\n\nDuties of Partners\u00a0inter se\nNow that we have seen the rights of partners let us see the duties the Act has prescribed,\n\nGeneral duties:\u00a0Every partner has the following general duties like carrying on the business to the greatest common good, duty to be just and faithful towards each other, rendering true accounts, and providing full information of all things affecting the firm. etc\nDuty to indemnify for fraud:\u00a0Every partner has to indemnify the firm for losses caused to it by his fraud in the conduct of business. The Act has adopted this principle because the firm is liable for wrongful acts of partners. Any partner who commits fraud must indemnify other partners for his actions.\nDuty to act diligently:\u00a0Every partner must attend to his duties towards the firm as diligently as possible because his not functioning diligently affects other partners as well. He is liable to indemnify others if his willful neglect causes losses to the firm.\nDuty to use the firm\u2019s property properly:\u00a0Partners can use the firm\u2019s property exclusively for its business, and not for any personal purpose, because they all own it collectively. Hence, they must be careful while using these properties.\nDuty to not earn personal profits or to compete:\u00a0Each partner must function according to commonly shared goals. They should not make any personal profit and must not engage in any competing business venture. They should hand over personal profits made to their firm.\n\nEffect on Rights and Duties after a change in Firm\nThe nature of the existing relationship between partners will be affected whenever there is a change in the firm\u2019s constitution. Such changes occur in the following situations:\n\nChange in constitution of the firm due to incoming or outgoing or partner(s);\nExpiry of the pre-determined term of the firm; and\nCarrying out of additional business undertakings than originally agreed upon.\n\nMutual rights and duties of the partners will continue to be the same as they existed prior to such changes, but partners can change this by making a fresh partnership deed.\nSolved Examples for You\nQuestion: Aman and Priya started a partnership firm for which they contributed capital of Rs. 1 lakh and Rs. 50,000 each. Aman wants interest on his capital as he has contributed more. Can he ask for such interest?\nAnswer: Interest is payable on capital only if the deed states so. Aman cannot claim an interest in the absence of a deed.\nQuestion: A dispute arose between Aman and Priya with respect to sharing of profits. Aman demands equal profits, but Priya wants more as she works longer hours than him. Who is correct?\nAnswer: Profits must be shared in accordance with the ratio agreed upon by them in their deed. They can change this ratio with mutual acceptance. However, they are both entitled to equal share if no such deed exists."

Immovable property can be legally transferred/conveyed only by way of a deed of conveyance/sale deed which is duly stamped under the provisions of the Stamp Act applicable to the state in which such property is situated, as well as registered under the provisions of the Registration Act, 1908. Of course, a power of attorney can be granted by the party transferring the property (transferor) to the party to whom the property is to be transferred (transferee) for the purposes of granting authority to the transferee to execute the conveyance/sale deed in favour of the transferee, and registration of the conveyance/sale deed on behalf of the transferor. However, such a power of attorney itself would not grant any right, title or interest in the immovable property in favour of the transferee, and a conveyance/sale deed would be required to be executed, stamped and registered for this purpose. It may be noted that in some states, such a power of attorney itself will have to be stamped and registered. The above view takes support from the judgement of the Supreme Court of India pronounced in October 2011 in the matter of Suraj Lamp and Industries Pvt. Ltd vs the state of Haryana and others. In this judgement, the Supreme Court has reiterated that GPA transactions are not \u201ctransfers\u201d or \u201csales\u201d and that such transactions cannot be treated as completed transfers or conveyances; however, nothing prevents affected parties from getting registered deeds of conveyance to complete their title. The Supreme Court has further held that GPA transactions may also be used to obtain specific performance or to defend possession under section 53A of Transfer of Property Act, 1882."

If the use or enjoyment of property is granted to a person for life or other limited period such person cannot be said to be an \u201cowner\u201d during that period.\nThe Transfer of Property Act, 1882 under Chapter VII talks about gifts and the procedure for making the same. Yet as per section 129 of the Act, the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 does not apply to the Muslims making gift.\n It has been widely construed that the term mal has to apply to the object so gifted for the laws of Hiba to apply.\nSurprisingly enough, all gifts are revocable before the actual transfer of property is made (i.e.) any person can unilaterally revoke his or her promise to gift before the promise is fulfilled. \nA Man may lawfully make a gift of his property to another during his lifetime; or he may give it away to someone after his death by will. The first is called a disposition inter vivos; the second, a testamentary disposition. Muhammadan law permits both kinds of transfers; but while a disposition inter vivos is unfettered as to quantum, a testamentary disposition is limited to one-third of the net estate. Muhammadan law allows a man to give away the whole of his property during his lifetime, but only one-third of it can be bequeathed by will.\nSince muslim law views the law of Gift as a part of law of contract, there must be an offer (izab), an acceptance (qabul), and transfer (qabza). In Smt Hussenabi v Husensab Hasan[vii], a grandfather made an offer of gift to his grandchildren. He also accepted the offer on behalf of minor grandchildren. However, no express of implied acceptance was made by a major grandson. Karnataka HC held that since the three elements of the gift were not present in the case of the major grandchild, the gift was not valid. It was valid in regards to the minor grandchildren.\nThe decree and judgment of the sub court may challenged in the appellate court stating that the possession was not handed over and the gift with condition is not valid hence the revocation of the gift deed by the donor is very much valid."

This could be temporary or permanent.\nThe Court may also ask the encroacher to give the damages or in other words compensation for the encroachment. This is calculated on the present value of the land and estimating the proportion of loss caused.\nIf you see an encroachment and want to proceed the legal way, you should approach the court for an order of injunction as per Order 39 (rules 1, 2 and 3) and claim the damages\n\nSeek legal assistance and get an injunction order or eviction notice from the court to do away with the illicit possession of your property. It is important to consult an experienced legal counsellor to expedite the process. Moreover, afore fetching expert assistance, reach out to the tehsildar (who has all land records registered) and get the area of your land measured.

I left my father home 15 years ago due to family differences and not on talking terms with other legal heirs. Before the death when he was very serious he called me and told that I want to execute a will and want the division of his property as out of my four storey building 2 floors will go to your mother and one floor each to both of you brothers. I informed my mother and sibblings as all were present there that he wants to get his will executed but they all resisted and finally mother told me let him die in peace and I have heard his last wish so I will do the distribution as per his wish and all family members agreed to it.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of our father the younger brother prepared a fabricated will and claimed that the entire property and bank balances belong to him only as per that will and even withdrawn the bank balances after the death by depositing his pre signed cheques in his favour without informing the bankers and claiming the whole rent of the property also.Then I informed my mother about this she told me that do not worry I will give you the share as per his wish but wait for some time.\r\nThen I filed a criminal complaint to the police that my younger brother has made a fabricated will with the collision of two witnesses who are strangers to my father and illegally withdrawn the money from the bank. When IO called him he told him that I have filed for the probate of the will in the Honble Delhi High Court and withdrawn the money with the consent of the mother who is the nominee. Police told me that you have a family dispute and there is no cause for FIR.\r\nNow I have filed a complaint u/s 156(3) and IO has filled his ATR that he has enquired the witnesses and other other family members although sisters are saying that the will is forged and witnesses are not known persons but since the matter is subjudice and money has been withdrawn with the consent of the nominee so there is no reason to register FIR. \r\nAs far as probate case is concerned he has not send any notice to any legal heirs despite several times instructed by the court and even imposing a fine on him as I attend every date and no one appears from his side so he is playing delayed practices.\r\nAs far as 156 case is concerned now we have to argue but IO didnot appear on the last date so court again issued orders for the IO to appear and I think he may give money to IO for skipping the date.\r\nNow I want to know whether I can file RTI and can\r\n(1) demand for the inspection of the file thoroughly to prepare my arguments, \r\n(2) demand the photocopies of the papers obtained by the IO in the course of investigation like other legal heirs statements, witnesses satements, bankers staements and copies of the cheques taken by the IO.\r\n(3) Can I ask who is the IO now and what was the reason for not attending the date or progress of the 156(3) from them.",

        "query-text": "Hi,\r\nI am 25 years old guy, last year I met my gf, we started having s%x after one week of knowing each other as interest was from both side. I cleared at the starting that I can't marry her. She was ok with it at the starting, but slowly slowly I felt she was trying to put me in a condition where I 'll have no point of return than marrying her. So I used to tell her not to keep any attachment.By the way she used to give me suicidal threat all the time from the starting that her ex spoiled her life she don't want to live. Later one day (after 3/4 months after meeting her), I told her I'm gonna break up. She started crying and pleaded to be with her till she get a good job as she wanted to earn more, I was fool started helping her thinking she 'll leave me once her career is settled. Well one day finally she got a good offer. After she got offer I was little bit attached to her. One day I told her, \"How long will it work like this, we need to think\". I was pointing to break up but she thought I was talking about marrying her, later I clarified that it is not what she is thinking. But she was not ready to listen to me.  Hence argument started, I was trying to break up badly. She was forcing me to stay another 3-4 months. As I was badly seeking for break up, I talked to her elder sister to ask what I can do at this moment, she told to change the current address and change the ph no, so I did that as this seemed to me a feasible solution. Then she went to police station when she saw I'm not ready for compromise at that situation, the reason she went to police station is to track my no to see where I am staying currently. Police sent her back saying that can not be done. Later again she went to police and said that I gave her hope to marry now I left and she took police to my office and to take me to police station. I was really scared thinking that she might had done or tried committing suicide. Then after going to police station I told everything to the officer and finally I was able to made them understand, they didn't take FIR or complaint. But next day the police officer called me up and started scaring that she 'll put rape charge and all , I have to give him 20k then he 'll introduce me to his lawyer to get anticipatory bail(I was really shocked why he wants me to take bail as there is no question of even sexual harassment ) . Still I told I 'll give the money but it will take time. That when I came office I got to know my office ID was deactivated as police came to the office , its a question of company's reputation. I need to get clearance certificate from police station. I was not able to find a way how to tackle the situation and decided better to patch up with her and I 'll ask her to help me to get the clearance certificate. She did. Even after lot of argument with police, they were not ready to give me clearance, finally she told she will withdraw the NC she had lodged, she withdrew the NC. Well, after that my office was ready to take me back after verifying the copy of the withdrawal request. \r\nI didn't know that was my biggest mistake patching up with her again. Its been 3 months since all this police saga happened. Now a days , she is doing everything forcefully, she is coming to my house without permission, she is forcefully having s$x. I am trying to find a proper way to get  out of this relation, hence thought of posting here. As per our last discussion we decided any one of us  will go away from here(I'm badly waiting for the day). But I don't have any belief on her at this point . If I dont want to have sex, either she is fighting with me or sometimes scaring me that she wont leave me so easily.\r\nI really don't know what should be my correct step to get rid of her. Staying with her(NOT live in), seems like staying with a time bomb, I don't know when it will burst out.\r\nAs an IT professional, I dont want to get into any legal trouble as that can be end of my career.\r\n\r\nCould anyone please guide me on how to tackle this situation, can;t really sleep thinking of all these.",

Neha & Anr, Hon'ble Supreme Court stated that there can be no straitjacket formula for fixing such a quantum. Stressing upon the importance of maintaining a careful and just balance between all relevant factors, the Court held that the maintenance amount awarded must be reasonable and realistic. It directed the Courts to take cognizance of the fact that maintenance awarded to the applicant should neither be so extravagant that it becomes oppressive and unbearable for the respondent, nor should it be so meagre that it drives the applicant to penury.\nIn addition to the statutory guidance, the Court laid down the following indicative factors to be considered before determining the quantum of maintenance (a) the status of the parties; (b) reasonable needs of the wife and dependent children; (c) whether the applicant is educated and professionally qualified; (d) whether the applicant has any independent source of income; (e) whether the income is sufficient to enable the applicant to maintain the same standard of living as she was accustomed to in her matrimonial home; (f) whether the applicant was employed prior to her marriage; (g) whether she was working during the subsistence of the marriage; (h) whether the wife was required to sacrifice her employment opportunities for nurturing the family, child rearing, and looking after adult members of the family; (i) reasonable costs of litigation for a non-working wife.\nApart from the aforesaid factors set out hereinabove, the Court laid down certain additional factors for determining the quantum of maintenance payable. These are inter alia as follows:\nAge and employment of parties;Duration of marriage;\nMaintenance of minor children; andSerious disability or ill health of a spouse, child /children from the marriage or dependent relative who require constant care and recurrent expenditure, would also be a relevant consideration while quantifying maintenance.\nThe aforesaid factors are not exhaustive, and the concerned Court can exercise its discretion to consider any other factor/s, which may be necessary or relevant in the facts and circumstances of a particular case.\nFurther, in case of Manokaran vs. M.Devaki where it was held that Grant of maintenance to the wife working and earning more that her husband is improper and the same cannot be said that the wife was not having sufficient independent income.\nShe can demand alimony, however, depending on the facts and circumstances you mentioned it can be denied if defended properly. It can be claimed for child as well. Maintenance amount can be reduced if passed against him in appellate Courts since she is presently working and she will have to submit an affidavit in Court about her present financial status.

        "query-text": "Palash (33) & Puja (30, MA, BED) had Friendship & love relation for last 6-7 years. But when puja & her family came to Palash & family for marriage proposal, palash denied marrying the girl due to some reason. After creating some political pressure on Palash\u2019s family, Puja lodged a FIR on 29.10.2013 against Palash with the help of some political leader. In FIR Police charged the sections 376 & 493 and started investigation. The text of the FIR was as follows:\r\n\r\n[I am Puja of -----------------------, I have love relation with Palash for last 7 years. But now he is not ready to marry me. He has physical relation with me on the basis of promise of marriage more than one occasion. His friends (X,Y & Z etc.............) know everything. Kindly accept this letter as FIR]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Puja declined herself for the medical test. \r\n\r\nOn [deleted], Palash got anticipatory bail from the division bench of Hn. High court by 1st attempt against PR Bond. After that he has gone through the medical test & surrendered himself in local PS & lower court.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time (April 2015/ before CS ) PALASH applied for quashing at HC but it was rejected by HC & advised if no CS till 3 years then apply to lower court for cancel the investigation.\r\n\r\nAfter that PALASH got married with other girl in May 2015 & the girl PUJA got married with other boy in April 2016. \r\n\r\nCS (only 1 page) submitted by the police to the lower court in May 2016. In CS police has shown that they have ceased only one material which is one joint photograph of the PALASH & PUJA in a DURGA festival (Durga Puja/ public place). Also they have examined 7-8 witnesses. Out of them 5 were relatives of the girl puja & 2 local people of PALASH but the boy PALASH didn\u2019t know them though they claimed in their statement (161) that they are the friend of PALASH & they used to see in several occasions that PUJA used to stay night at Palash\u2019s house which is totally false. Puja didn\u2019t mentioned this blame in any of her statement (FIR/164) & also she has accepted in 164 that she had CONSENT & that word is mentioned in 164 statement. But surprisingly police didn\u2019t examine the TWO witnesses about whom the girl has mentioned in her written FIR application. \r\n\r\nUnder the above circumstances in July 2016 again PALASH applied for quashing the CS at HC through a junior advocate & again this time it was rejected.\r\n\r\nNow what next?\r\n\r\nIs there any solid chance?\r\n\r\n1.\tShould Palash again apply to HC u/s 482?\r\n2.\tShould Palash challenge it to SC? What would be the rough expenses?\r\n3.\tHow to apply to SC from Kolkata? We need to move to delhi for that ?\r\n4.\tShould Palash apply to lower court for discharge u/s 227 crpc?\r\n5.\tNow in trial how to prove u/s 376 & 493 ?\r\n6.\tWhat are the other options to avoid the trial at lower court because it takes huge time in that court (5-6 years average) & so it would be very painful?\r\n7.\tIf Palash does not appear in court during trial then is there any chance of arrest?",

                "response-text": "Dear Sir,\nYes, you can buy the land but you must have to know about the rules and restrictions you must be aware of when purchasing agricultural land :-\nVarious states follow different procedures for the purchase of agricultural land. In certain states only an agriculturist can purchase such land whereas there are no restrictions in other states. All over India, NRIs and PIOs can\u2019t purchase agricultural land/plantation property/farm houses. They can, however, inherit agricultural lands.\nTamil Nadu\nThere are no restrictions for those looking at investing in agricultural land. The maximum extent of land that can be purchased is 59.95 acres and it can be converted into non-agricultural land by the orders of the district collector, provided that no agricultural activity has been carried out in the said land during the last 10 years (prior to the date of conversion).\nKarnataka\nOnly an agriculturist can purchase agricultural land. A non-agriculturist is a person whose income from any source exceeds Rs. 25 lakh per annum (earlier the limit was Rs.2 lakh per annum). Under Section 109 of Karnataka Land Revenue Act, 1964, social or industrial organisations can purchase agricultural land with Government approval.\nKerala\nSimilar to Tamil Nadu, anyone can purchase agricultural land here. The maximum ceiling limit of land area as per the Kerala Land Reforms Act, 1963 is as follows:\na) In case of an adult unmarried person or a family consisting of a sole surviving member, five standard acres and the ceiling limit shall not be less than six and more than seven-and-a-half acres.\nb) For a family consisting of two or more but no more than five members, 10 standard acres and the ceiling limit shall not be less than 12 and more than 15 acres.\nc) If it\u2019s a family consisting of more than five members, 10 standard acres increased by one standard acre for each member in excess of five, and the ceiling limit shall not be less than 12 and more than 20 acres.\nd) For any other person, other than a joint family, 10 standard acres and the ceiling limit shall not be less than 12 and more than 15 acres.\nMaharashtra\nOnly an agriculturist can purchase agricultural land and if a person holds such land anywhere else in India, he can still be deemed an agriculturist in Maharashtra. The maximum ceiling limit for such land is 54 acres.\nGujarat\nAgricultural lands can\u2019t be purchased by a non-agriculturist. Earlier, only those residing in the State could invest in agricultural land in Gujarat but in 2012 the Gujarat High Court passed a judgement that allows any agriculturist in the country to purchase such land in the State.\nMadhya Pradesh and Rajasthan\nThere are no restrictions in these states. Earlier, under Section 17 of the Imposition of Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings Act, 1973, there were certain ceiling limits on buying agricultural land from the \u2018Khatedars\u2019 in Rajasthan. The provisions of this section were amended in 2010 and people from other states can now purchase agricultural land here. One has to, however, apply for conversion within a year from acquisition and commence the proposed non-agricultural use within three years from the date of conversion in Rajasthan.\nHaryana\nCertain areas in the State have been declared \u2018controlled areas\u2019 and for those looking at purchasing agricultural land in these areas for non-agricultural purposes, they need to obtain a certificate indicating the change of land use from the Government of Haryana.\nHimachal Pradesh\nOnly an agriculturist belonging to the State can purchase agricultural land here. People from other states require prior permission of the Government of Himachal Pradesh u/s 118 of HP Tenancy and Land Reforms Act. The maximum land ceiling limit in is 160 bighas or 32 acres.\nWest Bengal\nAs per the West Bengal Land Reforms Act, private ownership of agricultural land in the State is capped at 17.5 acres for irrigated areas and 24.5 acres for areas that are only rainfed. In urban areas, private ownership is capped at 7.5\u00a0cottahs\u00a0or one-eighth of an acre. Only tea gardens, mills, workshops, livestock breeding firms, poultry farms, dairies, and townships are exempted from the restrictions of the Land Reforms Act."

However the following conditions known to you are to be satisfied. But during oral legal counseling I can suggest how you can override the difficult situation and purchase the agricultural land. As you know the word \u201cfamily\u201d includes husband and wife. We must read the provisions between the lines and get benefit out of it. The law is as follows:\n=======================================================================================\nAgricultural land can be bought in Karnataka after fulfilling certain requirements.\nThese include:\nThe annual average income of the person including agricultural income should be less than Rs 25 lakhs.\nThe person must have had an agricultural land in his name before the year 1974. The person should be an agriculturist or an agricultural worker by profession.\nAs per Section 79A of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act 1961, the non-agricultural income of a purchaser who must be an agriculturist should not exceed Rs 25 lakhs per year. Sale of land granted to members of scheduled caste and tribe is not allowed. Also, sale of land granted by the government is not allowed for a period of 15 years. Agricultural land can be used only for agricultural purposes and no other purposes. Utilising agricultural land for any other purpose is prohibited by law. Agricultural land, which does not come under the Green Belt, can be converted for non-agricultural purposes like residential, commercial, industrial etc, subject to the approval of the Special Deputy Commissioner on payment of the prescribed fees and subject to certain conditions.\nDear Sir,\nYou must satisfy the following conditions, if not then you must get a certificate showing you are agricultural labor. The later is easy because even Amithab Bachan taken such certificate to legalize his purchase of agricultural fields that is coffee estates.\n(i) That he is coming from agricultural family and holding agricultural lands as on prescribed date i.e., 01.03.1974.\n(ii) That his individual income is less than Rs. 2,00,000/- per annum and \n(iii) That he is having source of income to purchase above agricultural land.\nAgricultural land can be bought in Karnataka after fulfilling certain requirements.\nThese include:\nThe annual average income of the person including agricultural income should be less than Rs 25 lakhs.\nThe person must have had an agricultural land in his name before the year 1974. The person should be an agriculturist or an agricultural worker by profession.\nAs per Section 79A of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act 1961, the non-agricultural income of a purchaser who must be an agriculturist should not exceed Rs 25 lakhs per year. \n===================================================================\nKARNATAKA LAND REFORMS ACT 1961\nRESTRICTIONS ON 1\n[HOLDING OR]\nTRANSFER OF AGRICULTURAL LANDS\n[79A.

(Jan 01, 2011)\r\n\r\nFor the first three years we lived as a joint family with my father and mother. w.e.f. Jan 01, 2014 we move to our rented home near our old home. Since we both are working we left home at 8 am for office and come by 8 pm. (we drop our daughter at my old home to my parents which is nereby on a daily basis) After 4 months (on 2nd may, 2014) my wife (26 yrs) left our rented home with our 2 year old daughter with all her Stridhan. (only she sent one text message on my cell at 11 am in the morning that \" I'm going to my parent place permanently with our daughter\"). Hence I informed the same at our local police station on the same day via written application. I have gone once in a week to her residence for the first two months but she never talks to me and if I tried, not giving any response, don't receive my phone calls, After 3 months my parents received threatening call from her parent asking for Stridhan or else they file criminal cases against me n my parents. so again I have given 2nd written application in the same police station about the threatening call.\r\n\r\nEven her parents were not supportive and doesn't want our relation to continue with. they even not telling me the exact reason why they front want to continue. she is the only child in her family. she is stubborn and short tempered by nature and thinking too much unnecessarily which results in stress and also undergoing some psychiatric treatment about\r\nStress. She even tried for suicide in year 2008 before 3 years of message by cutting her wrist. She had communicated this to me when we are on our honeymoon after marriage.\r\n\r\nShe is frequently changing her cell no. and not even shared with me. so upon strong doubt have discovered that she is talking to one of her school male friend (27 yr) frequently in the midnight \r\n(12 to 3). having her call records as a proof via detective report.\r\n\r\nI'm having 30000 salary pm (mba in finance)/ she is also employed with 30000 salary pm (diploma civil engineer)\r\n\r\nI even had sent two general e-mails with reminders to her on Sep 2014 to come back our home thinking the future of our 2 yr old daughter. but have not received any feedback from her.\r\n\r\nShe had insisted mutual divorce orally three to four times in between this tenure. but in Dec 2014, she had made a complaint in women cell at thane. Then I received call from thane police station for further investigation. When I go there 3 women (avg 50 years of age) had a chat with me for around 30 minutes. Even my wife was present there. She even admitted there orally that i had not beaten her and our daughter was taken care by her in laws only which she wrongly put in her complaint. When asked by few questions by the ladies, she kept on crying but couldn't answered a single question. But later after 10 days she given her written statement saying that she will proceed only through court by mutual consent.\r\n\r\nNow she had filed section 12 and sec 23 under domestic violence on me few days back.\r\n\r\nkindly advise on following points.\r\n\r\n1. How can I protect myself from this domestic violence case? \r\n\r\n2. Can she file false criminal cases like 498a etc. against me later on after 1.5 years since she left? (Since it require jury's permission which I read through some references)\r\n\r\nI don't want to drag my family in this issue.\r\n\r\n3. If I will have to pay the maintainance, how much amount I will have to pay?\r\n\r\ndon't wish to give any rather would like to get the custody /responsibility of our daughter.\r\n\r\n4. Instead I want her to pay the maintainance charges to me since I have gone through tremendous mental agony and she had spoiled my life for no reason.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nNayan Thorat",

I have been asking her to agree to divorce agreement but she has been going in circles and at one time she asked for crazy obscene amount knowing very well that I cant afford that. At another instance she said that you file first then I will file. Other time she will say her family will decide. I spoke to her family and her family wants to close this matter mutually out of the court. But then she changed her mind again .I don't even want to go on the abuse etc part . I am done with her since 2011. I have provided for all the expenses to her so far. Now I am exhausted with all the options of solving the case in a mutually agreeable , dignified and respectful ways for her so have thought of going to court to seek a decision. However I am a US citizen now and she is Indian citizen. Also due to flights and issues related to Corona I am afraid I cant fly into India. The court is I go ahead would be Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh. My questions are:- 1. Can I file divorce petition online and have the hearing done via video conferencing?2. How long will it take to end a case like this. I appreciate your help . Thank you",

The transfer fee amount is decided by the members of the general body of the society.\nThere\u00a0is no legal basis on which a builder can levy transfer charges on the apartment owner.\nIt violates the Transfer of Property Act, 1882; which states that \u2018a transfer of property, passes forthwith to the transferee, all the interest which the transferor is then capable of passing in the property and in the legal incidents thereof\u2019. According to the Act,\u00a0the owner alone holds the full right to property and the builder has no right, title or interest over the property post\u00a0registration of the property\u00a0in the name of the owner.\n\u00a0It violates the Indian Contract Act, 1872. It is an extra contractual demand made by the builder on the buyer, which infringes the buyer\u2019s ownership rights.\nA builder has no rights over the ownership of the buyer\u2019s property and hence if the buyer wants to sell the property off to a third party, then no payment can be demanded on the part of the builder.\nThe builders threaten that upon non-payment of transfer charges, the buyer would not be able to sell off the flat. This is a\u00a0punishable offense under Section 384 and 385 of Indian Penal Code (IPC).\nThe undue influence exerted by the builder is prohibited by\u00a0Competition Act, 2007.\u00a0Imposition of unlawful transfer fees by builders is deemed\u00a0\u2018abuse of dominant position\u2019\u00a0as defined under section 4 of the Act."

The buyer and the builder have to conclude the property transaction, based on the terms and conditions mentioned in the builder-buyer agreement, which clearly states the nitty-gritties involved in the property sale.\nTransfer charges in builder-buyer agreements\nThis clause in agreements used to state that the buyer had to pay the developer a \u2018transfer charge\u2019, if the apartment was resold before the buyer took its possession. No disclosure was, however, made about what kind of amount the buyer would have to pay.\nSection 13 (2) of the law prescribes that the builder-buyer agreement contain each and every detail, leaving little scope for confusion in terms of the builder\u2019s responsibilities.\n\u201cThe agreement for sale shall specify the particulars of development of the project, including the construction of building and apartments, along with specifications and internal development works and external development works, the dates and the manner by which payments towards the cost are to be made and the date on which it is to be handed over, the rates of interest in case of default, and such other particulars,\u201d says the law.\nWithout registration, a buyer has no legal right over the property so, one\u00a0cannot\u00a0sell it to anyone under the Transfer of Property Rights Act.\nSection 79 of the Cooperative Societies Act says that the premium amount of transfer charge should\u00a0not exceed Rs 25,000.\nA\u00a0transfer fee\u00a0is applicable only at\u00a0transfer\u00a0of property not at first sale by\u00a0builder. Demand of\u00a0society for transfer\u00a0is illegal.\nWhile your sale deed is the proof that the property has been legally transferred in your name, a share certificate is legal proof that you are the rightful owner of the co-operative housing society\u2019s shares. It is the duty of the\u00a0managing committee\u00a0to issue share certificates after due diligence. In the case of society share certificate transfer, the share certificates should be issued to transferee within a period of one month of receipt of the instrument of transfer by such Company.\nIn case of a resale, if a person needs to transfer the share certificate, all of the paperwork and necessary requirements pertaining to the transfer of shares must be completed on time. It is the new member who needs to pay the transfer premium and ensure that all the dues are cleared by the previous homeowner.\nIn case of transfer/resale, the original share certificate has to be given to the society along with the other documents needed. If the share certificate is being transferred to a new member after resale, they have to finished all paperwork prior to handing the share certificate, including the required transfer of shares procedures.\n\u00a0\nThank You."

A person who bought the premises disagree to renew the agreement and filed eviction and fair rent at a time. His motto was resell the premises for higher price. Even-though we provided enough proof to our lawyers they didn\u2019t execute it properly. So we lost RCOP and RCA. Fair rent case was in pending stage in madras high court. But as the person was very keen in selling the premises, he got eviction order stating that he want it for his own use by producing false proofs in high court on july 2016. We filed Special leave petition in supreme court as per our lawyer\u2019s advise, but it was rejected in the first hearing on jan 2017. So we evict the premises on july 2017 as there is no other option. That person sold the premises in the same month july 2017. We were in a exhausted state so we not even claimed our rent advance given to the previous owners. But this person already filed a Orginal suit in Chennai city civil court complex in 2016 asking for difference in contractual rent and fair rent fixed by RCA judgement. As we evicted the premises we didn\u2019t follow-up this case. Now after the sales (july 2017) he is proceeding the case. Now what should be done \r\n1) Is he eligible to continue the fair rent case in high court and Orginal suit in Chennai city civil court complex as he sold the premises on 2017? \r\n2) In the eviction case he stated that he need the premises for his own use but he sold it on the same year, Is he liable for any forgery case? \r\n3) What should be done from ourside in this situation? OS status shows IA/EA pending and EVIDENCE, does it means it is going to be end soon? We are worried as this person is a criminal minded, he gives money to everyone and bend the law and earn money out of it.",

Aggrieved by the actions of the Builder, the Complainant approached the Commission, seeking refund of amounts paid along with an interest of 18% to 24% per annum. It was argued by the Builder that the quantum of compensation as mentioned under agreement should be the maximum compensation payable by the Builder in the prevailing circumstances, and not what the Complainant seeks.\nHeld:\u00a0The Commission held that compensation mentioned under the Agreement shall be payable only if the possession of the property was accepted by the Complainant, despite the delay.\nCompensation Paid:\u00a0The Builder was ordered to\u00a0refund the amount deposited by the Complainant, along with interest @ 18% per annum\u00a0from the date the deposit was made till the date on which the refund was made.

                "response-text": "Dear Sir,\nYou make use of following settled law of the land as pronounced by Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court of India, various High Courts and circulars of the State govt\nSupreme Court sets alimony benchmark: 25% of ex-husband\u2019s net salary\nThe Supreme Court has set a benchmark for maintenance to be paid by a husband to his estranged wife, stating that 25% of his net salary might constitute a \"just and proper\" amount as alimony.\nA bench of Justices R Banumathi and M M Santanagoudar made the observation while directing a resident of West Bengal's Hoogly, earning Rs 95,527 a month, to set aside Rs 20,000 as maintenance for his former wife and their son, turning down the man's plea that the amount was excessive. The court said the amount of maintenance or permanent alimony must be sufficient to ensure that a woman lived with dignity after separating from her husband.\nIts order came on the man's plea challenging a Calcutta high court order directing him to pay her Rs 23,000 per month. Though the apex court said there was nothing amiss in the high court order, it reduced the amount by Rs 3,000 on the ground that the man had remarried and hence needed to provide for his new family.\nHOW TO CALCULATE ALIMONY\n1)what is the max alimony can claim from him?\nAns: The quantum of maintence must be based of SC judgment which says 25% of salary must be maintenance. Thus it must be calculated as follows\nSalary Rs.2 lakhs per month\n25% comes to Rs.50,000 multiplied by 12 Months = Rs.6 lakhs per year.\nIf you live for another 20 years it comes to Rs.6 lakhs multiplied by 20 = Rs. 1crore 20 lakhs. \nYou get total compensation of Rs.1 Crore Rs.20 lakhs. \n2)can I ask for a property?\nAns: You have no right over property but its notional income may be added to the salary .\nHow to Reduce Alimony Payments\nWhat a judge will look at in considering a request to reduce alimony payments.\nWhen a marriage ends, it's not unusual for one spouse to pay alimony (also called \"spousal support\" or \"maintenance\") to the other after the divorce. The marital settlement agreement and/or the court's divorce judgment will contain an order that defines the terms of the alimony payments, like how much will be paid each month and when the payments are due. Some orders also say when alimony ends--this might be a specific date or be connected to an event, like the remarriage of the spouse receiving alimony.\nThe order may also describe circumstances under which alimony can be modified (changed) - for example, if the paying spouse becomes unemployed. Some agreements and orders may state that the amount of alimony can't be changed under any circumstances.\nYou will Need to Show a Change In Circumstances\nIf the settlement agreement or order doesn't address the issue of when alimony can be modified, then either spouse is free to seek a change to alimony by filing a request with the court. For example, a paying spouse who can no longer afford alimony must ask the court to make a change, and must prove why the reduction is justified. In order to convince the court to reduce (or even terminate) alimony, the paying spouse must demonstrate a significant change in the financial circumstances of one or both spouses, such as:\n\u2022\tthe involuntary loss of a job or wage reduction\n\u2022\tan illness or disability that prevents the paying spouse from working\n\u2022\tthe remarriage of the supported spouse\n\u2022\tthe supported spouse's cohabitation with a new partner, or\n\u2022\tand increase in former spouse\u2019s income.\nThe change in circumstances must be significant though - the judge won't grant a reduction based on a minor adjustment to either spouse's income or other financial resources.\nOnce a motion to modify alimony has been filed, the court will typically allow the spouses to conduct \"discovery,\" meaning each will be entitled to ask the other to produce financial documentation showing the ability to pay support and/or the need for financial support, such as paystubs, tax returns, and financial statements.\nGetting Help\nModifying alimony can be complicated; discovery and trial court procedures generally require legal expertise. If you have questions about changing alimony, you should contact an experienced family law attorney for help."

Later in mid May 2016 because of personal issues at home, I requested a cancellation (both verbally and in writing) and full refund of the booking amount - I was assured that total amount will be refunded - I have this in writing from them in my emails and text messages. \r\n\r\nAs I live in Hyderabad, they posted us the contract/agreement after I paid them 13.36 lakh. \r\n\r\nI DID NOT sign anywhere in the contract/agreement and sent it back (by post) as I had cancelled my booking just after few days of booking and again requested a full refund as I had not signed anywhere. \r\n\r\nNow it has been almost 4 months, the builder is giving different answers ... like, they will deduct 10 % of the total base price + service tax, so a total of around 6.5 lakh ! \r\n\r\nNote: I have receipts of the bank transfers & Cheque. \r\n\r\nI want to know what are my rights ? \r\n\r\n1.

I had also filed for divorce earlier to her dowry case. Divorce case is in court but she didn't attend 2 dates. Fr daowry case nothing is happening. Police has not filed charge-sheet till date i guess even after 6 months. We all got anticipatory bail. \r\nShe is living in my home with her family members. Bole to kabja kar rakha hai. My family is out of own house. she doesn't allow anyone to enter. She has locked all the rooms. She shouts n even hit my family members when they go there. Father had installed CCTV cameras in common areas fr his safety as she blames him of violence & rape attempt. but she broke all cameras. She also go to tenants and ask for rent.She is violent not us. She can fight with anyone. she can hit anyone. even i got 2-3 knife stokes frm her.\r\nwe r contacting police but they do nothing. Don't even take complaints against her. But they are ready to take complaints against us if she files. That is my ancestral property and still in the name of my late grandmother. Father is tensed and seriously thinking of selling that property. I also lost my job because of dowry case. Police had came to my office in Delhi. That time i hadn't got bail. \r\n\r\nHonorable judge of Patna high court clearly told her on her face that she is a liar as she was trying hard that i don't get bail by crying n shouting. U can imagine how she is if can shout in high court.\r\n\r\nShe says na mere sath rahegi aur na hi chhodegi. Everybody in my whole family is now pissed off. I m in Delhi and my father is not allowing me to come there as he is afraid of filing more false cases upon me. My condition is like I cud do anything now to her. She totally ruined my carreer and my life. I m also thinking to move frward as it getting difficult to live alone fr me without a partner. u know wt i mean.\r\nI want to know what options are there to control her. I know i can't ask her to leave my house but there must be some rules to take action against her.",

The court had relied on our title deed as the main piece of evidence. During the trial as well as during the appeal the appellant/petitioner's never challenged our title, the appellant/petitioner's suit also does not seek/ask any relief from the court that could grant him title, their case is for permanent injunction under Specific relief act. The appellants has since put up an appeal and have been wasting time on various pretexts. The property in question falls within a housing co-operative.\r\n\r\nNow, very strangely audit reports of the Co-operative society obtained via RTI from the Govt.'s Directorate of Co-operative Audit shows the appellant/petitioner's name in place of ours where the 'Detailed List of Land Cost' (the document that shows who all have paid sums to the Co-operative as cost of land bought from the co-operative) appears in the audit report. We have original title deeds as mentioned above, we have never sold/transferred our property, we have been paying land tax to the govt. without fail every year. Not only that, a part of the property(1 floor out of a 2 storied building) in question is also in our possession, the place is our hometown while we stay in Kolkata.\r\n\r\nAm i understanding it correctly if i say this has been an act of criminal nature. If yes, what remedies are available, i believe getting the police to act won't be easy as there is civil suit ongoing and pending. I have put this question under the heading Civil Law as well as i am not sure.\r\n\r\nThanks.",

The filing of a mutual divorce by both the husband and the wife is termed as \u0091the first motion\u0092. A couple can file for a second motion after a gap of six months. This time span is provided to the couple so that they get time to reconsider their marriage. A divorce decree can be passed before the completion of the six months term if all the mandatory requirements are sufficed. If the divorce file is not withdrawn within 18 months, the court passes a divorce decree. In case one of the sides withdraws the petition, the court initiates to make an enquiry. If the concerned side disagrees to give the consent, the court holds no right to pass the judgment."

What precaution I can take.?\nOpinion: - It will be better for you to file a civil suit for Permanent injunction against them before Civil Court of your area along with an application under Order XXXIX Rule 1 & 2 of CPC, if after the Civil Court order for temporary injunction, they visit your home or office and create any problem then they may be prosecuted for the offence of contempt of court under Order XXXIX Rule 2A of CPC.Apart from this, you may file a complaint against them before the commissioner of Police/SSP of your area and also may file a criminal complaint against them under section 190(1)(a) of Cr.P.C. read with section 200 of Cr.P.C. for criminal intimidation and threatening. \n3. currently a mutual divorce petition with MOU was filed in civil court on July/2020, I did not attend the court date scheduled on dec/2020, next date is jan 2021 and I want to delay it by not attending the court proceedings, My ultimate aim is to get some time so that my wife thinks of reunion and saving the marriage.\nAlso, I paid 3 lakhs out of 6 lakhs(Final Settlement) at the time of signing the petition. payment done through Online transaction and remaining payment through Demand Draft.

Even\u00a0if\u00a0the complaint is\u00a0false, the accused is presumed to be guilty until he or she\u00a0proves\u00a0innocence in the court. The maximum punishment\u00a0if proven\u00a0guilty is imprisonment for three years.\nA counter lawsuit can be filed by the man under Section 500 (Defamation) of\u00a0the Indian Penal Code, 1860 for defamation. A\u00a0case\u00a0under this section can be filed in\u00a0case\u00a0a woman tries to malign the image of her husband and his parents by falsely accusing them under this section and dragging them to court or jail.\nRecently, the Supreme Court had ruled that even a single false dowry complaint against the husband and in-laws was sufficient ground for courts to grant decree of divorce to annul the marriage.\n\u00a0\nWhat to do if a False Domestic Violence and Dowry case is registered against you\nIf a false complaint is registered against you by your wife, you have two options \u2013 either to defend your case and wait for the judgement or to file a counter case against your wife and prove her wrong. Both are detailed below.\n\u00a0\nDefensive\nYou can defend yourself and your family from being sent to jail because of the false complaint. You have following options to defend your family and yourself-\nCollect as many pieces of evidence as possible\n\nRecord all conversations (voice, chat, email, letters, etc.) with those threatening and keep the originals in a safe place. It is advised not to produce the original evidence before anyone.\nCollect evidence to prove that you have neither demanded dowry nor have taken it anytime.\nCollect evidence to prove that she moved out of the bond of marriage for no valid reason.\nThis evidence will be fruitful in the time of getting anticipatory bail or notice bail from the court.\n\nSafeguard your Family\nThere are hundred of cases where the whole family is put behind the bars just because of one false complaint. Section 498A has a very wide jurisdiction under which the women can complain against anyone in the family. Even the mother and the father of the husband are not immune. In such a situation the husband can do the following to safeguard his parents and other family members \u2013\n\nOnce the FIR is lodged, the man can apply for anticipatory bail or notice bail so as to ensure that the innocent family members are not going behind bars without any just cause.\n\nHow the case turns out would totally depend on which state the case is lodged. Different states have different mechanisms to deal with the problems of false cases.\n\nFor example, in Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan the complaint would first be referred to CAW Cell (Crime Against Women Cell)/ Mahila Thana). Where attempts would be made for Settlement between husband and wife. And if no settlement is reached, the case would be converted into FIR. At this stage or even before, you can seek Anticipatory Bail or Notice Bail for all your family members to protect them from arrest.\nIn Uttar Pradesh/ Uttranchal, the FIR would be promptly registered but you would get 30 days to settle the case in mediation centre. By which time most people obtain stay on the arrest from High Court.\n\nComplaint about blackmailing, false allegations\nLodge a complaint to your nearest police station, detailing about blackmailing, her false allegations, and her unbearable behaviour. Request in your complaint that police should take necessary actions to stop her from making threats and abuses immediately, also tell the police verbally and in writing along with available evidence that you are facing blackmailing and threats and mental torture from your wife and/or her family, as the case maybe. Filing such a complaint early on can save you from a lot of trouble later on if you are the first one to file this.\nDrawback of this move\n\nPolice don\u2019t easily write down the complaints of men. Also, how the complaint is drafted is critical. This is why consulting a good criminal lawyer with experience in such matters before approaching the police is a good idea. Get your complaint drafted by a trial lawyer if possible. If police the\u00a0refuse\u00a0to register the complaint, seek the help of a lawyer again. They will be able to make the police register the complaint.\nPolice itself sometimes provoke the wife to register a false complaint against the husband, the reason being the greed of taking bribe later.\n\nDo not enter into a Settlement with your wife\n\nIf you have to compromise, do it without paying any money. By paying her money you will indirectly accept the blackmailing and guilt. Your act will encourage fraudulent women to do more blackmailing.\nDespite all this, if you decide to pay and compromise then do not pay all the money till High court or Supreme court have given the final order of compounding the IPC 498A and all offence including the divorce decree. This is where your lawyer\u2019s role in negotiations will be critical. You should get the settlement conditions agreed by both parties in writing (in the same agreement) including her and her family members. Also get them to file A court statement under IPC-156 that they will not challenge this order in higher courts and that they will take back all the cases filed against you and all your relatives in all the courts. They should get the final instalment of money after all cases and proceedings are withdrawn and closed.\n\nRaise the issue of false complaint\nStart writing letters to the media, human rights organizations, etc, telling them about the misuse of Section 498A. Use social media platform for reaching the mass. This will not give you legal relief but bring the attention of the society toward the misuses of the law.\n\u00a0\nHow much maintenance allotted to woman under 498a?\nIPC 498a is section 498a of Indian Penal Code (IPC) dealing with cruelty to wives by husband or relatives.\u00a0 The kind of cruelty should be of such nature that it would drive a woman to suicide.\u00a0 It\u00a0DOES NOT say anything about maintenance\u00a0of wives by husbands.\u00a0 Criminal law is NOT meant to give compensation or ongoing payments to victim(s), that\u00a0would be illegal under Indian law because it would be in the nature of blood money.\u00a0 So if she wants to file 498a and expect to get Rs 50,000 per month for the rest of life from husband, forget it! but in case she gets the divorce, she can claim maintenance but not the share of your property.\n\u201cGenerally, it's 1/3rd to 1/5th gross earnings of the\u00a0spouse\u00a0who has to pay when it's a lump sum\u00a0alimony and\u00a0not more than 25% of husband's salary as monthly\u00a0maintenance\u00a0as per a Supreme Court judgement.\nThe\u00a0spouse\u00a0with less income or no income can get a\u00a0maintenance\u00a0amount which is equal to 20% to 30% of the total monthly income of the other. As per the judgment passed by the Supreme Court,\u00a0alimony\u00a0amount should not exceed 25% of the husband's income. The aforesaid limit is applicable in case of monthly payout.\n\u00a0\nAfter divorce, the lady is\u00a0entitled\u00a0to receive the\u00a0maintenance\u00a0till she marries again\u201d,"

Unless she has conclusive proof with her in terms of documents, letters, emails, witnesses which can prove that you have been cruel to her during the term of your marriage. \nIn case she is wily she may opt to file a police complaint under Section 498A of Indian Penal Code (IPC) to put pressure on you to comply. \nAs regards a charge of Adultery, that you propose to file or initiate charges of adultery is time consuming and hard to prove on the basis of a Hotel Bill in the name of the man or any messages. They can claim to be colleagues.\nUltimately if there is no love, trust and faith in the relationship, your marriage will continue to flounder and hence it would be less emotionally stressful if you file a Divorce by Mutual Consent and move on in life."

After an year she conceived. When she was 3 months pregnant, she went to Coimbatore where her mother is living to attend her brother's marriage engagement. She stayed with them saying that doctor advised not to travel to chennai .Later she revealed that it was not the doctor but her mother retained her. After birth of my grandson, we aked her to come. She was silent, only her parents and her brother spoke to us and refusing to send her. When my grand son was 5 years old, after counciling with relatives she send her. It all took 12 months.\r\nMeanwhile, during this period, my son went to Malaysia on office project work. He took his wife and infant son along with him. She stayed with him for 3 months.My son along with wife and son came back to India for some festival. He went back leaving her for 15 days. All those 15 days she stayed with her parents.He came back and took her again to Malaysia. He took his mother also to Malaysia to take care of our grandson..After 1 month she started quarelling with him saying that she want to see her mother and want to go back to India.She did all kind of tactics to go back to her mother.My wife advised but in vain.During that period she went to the extent of fasting for 2 days. My son did everything to bring normalcy. He took a knife and told her he will cut his hands if she continues her fasting, then only she ends her fasting. Seeing all these my wife came back to India. After a week she again started allover again. My sun could not tolerate all this and send her back to India. She went to her mother's house and stayed there for more than a month now.\r\n Knowing her mother's nature, myself my wife and 2 of our relatives went to their home to ask when she is going to come.She told she wants to stop breast feeding. It needs some time.Her mother still saying it is not her daughter to decide, it is she to decide simply saying she will not send her to Malaysia and she will send her to her marital home only when her husband stays with her and will not send to live with us i.e father in-law and mother in-law. During counciling her brother used unrespectful words against me. I replied for which he tried to beat me which was prevented by our relatives.\r\n Now she stopped breast feeding.My son told her, he will come to India to take her back to Malaysia and asked for a date. She told she is ready and asked to book flight tickets. He came to India on 4th oct'2019. He asked her to be ready on 8th to go back for which she simply says her parents only will decide on what date she can go. She says \" I am willing to come with you\" but her parents say we are not sending her. We are ready to go for divorce\" Our daughter in-law herself said there is no dowry harassment or anything else for divorce. What can possibly we do now. We want to live with grandson",

As per the latest Supreme Court judgment which had held that a decree of divorce granted by a foreign court is not valid in India if the ground is not recognized by Indian law.The key rule laid by the Supreme Court as follows: If a couple is married under Hindu law, (a) the foreign court that grants divorce must be acceptable under Hindu law; and (b) the foreign court should grant divorce only on the grounds which are permissible under Hindu Law. The two conditions make it almost impossible for a Hindu couple married in India to get a legally valid divorce from a foreign court since no foreign court is an acceptable one under Hindu Marriage Act and also because no foreign court is likely to consider the provisions of Hindu Marriage Act before granting divorce.It is not unusual for one of the partners to obtain a decree of divorce from a foreign court while the other partner is either in India or in some other part of the world. The partner who has obtained divorce may feel comfortable in the thought that the other partner has neither protested not contested the decree of divorce. However this comfort may be a false one.Hiring a UK lawyer is very expenseive \nA foreign judgment shall be conclusive as to any matter thereby directly adjudicated upon between the same parties or between parties under whom they or any of them claim litigating under the same title except-\n(a) where it has not been pronounced by a Court of competent jurisdiction;\n(b) where it has not been given on the merits of the case;\n(c) where it appears on the face of the proceedings to be founded on an incorrect view of international law or a refusal to recognise the law of India in cases in which such law is applicable;\n(d) where the proceedings in which the judgment was obtained are opposed to natural justice;\n(e) where it has been obtained by fraud;\n(f) where it sustains a claim founded on a breach of any law in force in India.\nSo these six conditions are fulfilled by such foreign judgment/decree of divorce then it will be valid for dissolving such Indian marriage as has been held by the Supreme Court of India in several of its judgments.\nWho wish to take benefit of Indian laws and legal system to avoid facing up to any foreign judicial system.If you are not attend the UK court, the court will pass an exparty divorce. Ex-parte decree of Divorce granted by foreign Court will not be recognized by Indian Court.\nWhen either the husband or the wife has, without reasonable excuse, withdrawn from the society of the other, the aggrieved party may apply, by petition to the district court, for restitution of conjugal rights and the court, on being satisfied of the truth of the statements made in such petition and that there is no legal ground why the application should not be granted, may decree restitution of conjugal rights accordingly.\nIn other aspects if you file a case in India for restitution of conjugal rights the execution also difficult due to her citizenship of UK ."

My father-in-law initially told my brother (Father expired) he is t against dowry but wished marriage ceremony to be done according to their standard. After both family met, and agreed for the matrimonial alliance, Roka of the boy was done. After Roka, ladke-wale started demanding some Cash and jewellaries on several ceremonies giving reasons of their reputation. On the day of marriage just before phere they demanded cash Rs 2 Lacs, saying that they will avail me of fridge, TV, washing machine and furniture from this cash. My brother was surprised when they suddenly demanded cash. \r\nAfter a week of marriage, in my matrimonial home, my mother-in-law told me to cook food as per their scheduled time saying that they are Radha-Soami followers and followed a rigid time schedule for several tasks. I was forced to follow the same. I being a working woman could not follow such rigid schedules. Before marriage they didn't tell me about such their rigid schedules. \r\nMy husband didn't cooperate me. He taunted me with my mother-in-law on my way of cooking and household tasks. He got severely irritated when I attended phone calls of my siblings, friends or relatives. He demanded sex beyond a reasonable limit. His such untimely and prolonged sex desire did not let me cook food and do household tasks on the rigid time schedule of in-laws. \r\nAfter a month of marriage, my brother and relatives visited my matrimonial home to take me following a custom. My in-laws happily permitted me to go. \r\nAfter I came to my maternal home, the very next day my husband started coercing me for mutual divorce. I asked him why he wanted divorce. He said he thinks \"ki hamari shadi aage tk chal nahi payegi, isliye divorce le lo\". He further said \" I want you to quit job and sit home and don't visit/call your friends, siblings and relatives. I said him I couldn't do so. Living in society, we have to visit friends, relatives and siblings. He argued and intimidated me of divorce if I did not agree to do so. My brother talked to him and father-in-law to resolve the issue but they abused him a lot and blamed him of taking all my earnings into his account. They demanded us to do all what they wanted and if we could not satisfy them, then they intimidated me and my brother saying \"Teri Behen ko ghar bitha dunga hamesha ke liye\". Neither he came to take me nor he let me come in my matrimonial home giving certain reasons. He didn't call me nor attended my calls as if I had done some sin visiting and helping my parents. I was served with divorce petition just after it got a year of marriage. In court I have filed Written statement. In second hearing, Judge suggested me to divorce him.I too hurtfully said it's okay I want divorce. In counselling I didn't say anything. My lawyer is a nice woman but lack experience. She forced me to say something in counselling but I was sad and denied to say anything. I didn't want divorce. What I should do now. Next hearing 20May",

Mutual consent means that both the parties agree for peaceful separation.\nMutual Consent Divorce\u00a0is a simple way of coming out of the marriage and dissolve it legally. Important requirement is the mutual consent of the husband & wife. There are two aspects on which\u00a0Husband & Wife have to reach to\u00a0consensus. One is the alimony or maintenance issues. As per Law there is no minimum or maximum limit of maintenance. It could be any figure or no figure. Next important consideration is the Child Custody. This can also be worked out effectively between the parties.\u00a0Child Custody in Mutual Consent Divorce\u00a0can be shared or joint or exclusive depending upon the understanding of the spouses.\nWhen can the divorce by mutual consent be filed?\nThe parties intending to dissolve marriage are required to wait for at least one year from the date of marriage.\nThey have to show that they have been living separately for a period of one year or more before the presentation of the petition for divorce and that during this period of separation they have not been able to live together as husband and wife.\nWhere to file the divorce petition?\nIn the family court of the city / district where both the partners lived together for the last time, which was their matrimonial home.\nAre there\u00a0different laws of divorce for different religion in India?\nThere are different laws of divorce for different religion. Hindus(which includes Sikh, Jain, Budh) are governed by\u00a0Hindu Marriage Act,1955.Christians\u00a0are governed by\u00a0Indian Divorce Act-1869\u00a0&\u00a0The Indian Christian Marriage Act,1872. Muslims are governed\u00a0by Personnel laws of Divorce\u00a0and also the\u00a0Dissolution of Marriage Act,1939\u00a0&\u00a0The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act,1986.\u00a0Similarly, Parsis are governed by The\u00a0Parsi Marriage & Divorce Act-1936. And there is also a secular law called\u00a0Special Marriage Act,1954.\nHow to file divorce petition by mutual consent? What happens in the court?\nThe\u00a0divorce petition\u00a0is in the form of affidavit, which is to be submitted to the family court. After the filing of the petition and recording the statement of both the parties, the court generally adjourns the matter for a period of 6 months.\nAfter six months the parties have to present themselves again in the court for making a second motion confirming the mutual consent filed earlier. It is only after this second motion that a decree of the divorce is granted by the court.\nCan any one party withdraw the mutual consent petition after filing in the court? What will happen by that?\nDuring this period of 6 months when the petition is pending in the court, any of the partner is fully entitled to withdraw the mutual consent by filing an application before the court stating that he/she does not wish to seek divorce by mutual consent.\nIn such circumstances, the court grants no divorce decree.\nWhat can the other partner do under such circumstances?\nThere is no option available to the other party to such circumstances except to file a normal petition for divorce under the provisions of the Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1950.\nIn such a situation divorce can be granted only on certain specified grounds like cruelty; desertion; voluntary sexual inter-course with another person; the other spouse being of unsound mind; conversion of religion by the other spouse; Leprosy; venereal disease; a spouse having renounced the world or being missing for a period of more than 7 years.\n\u00a0\nCan the spouse consent for remarriage without getting divorce from existing partner?\nRemarriage without getting divorce is a punishable offence with seven years imprisonment.\n\u00a0\nIf either of the spouses is not heard for a long time, should the divorce be applied?\nIf there is proof of the absence of spouse without any information to the other spouse about his whereabouts for a continuous seven years period, a petition should be filed in this regard in the court.\n\u00a0\nWhen the divorced persons can remarry?\nDepending on the nature of decree, after the expiry of three months from the date of decree if no notice of appeal is received by the person remarrying from the other person.\nWhat are the costs involved in getting divorce by mutual consent?\nIf you hire an advocate, it will be somewhere from Rs 25,000 to Rs 75,000.\nBut if you get the documentation done by us and file on your own without a lawyer, the cost will be very very low. You will not have any problem in filing your petition with our guidance, and you will save a lot of money.\nHow much time does the whole process take from filing the mutual consent petition in the court till the passing of the decree (judgment) by the court?\nIt takes from six months to one year from the date of filing of the petition. It varies from case to case & place to place."

Motherhood is such great status but she is not understanding. Your decision is very reasonable.. You may chose any of the following modes of divorce.\n================================================================\nDivorce Laws in India\nDivorce is the legal dissolution of marriage. A divorce is among the most traumatic misfortunes for any couple. The entire process of divorce that starts from coping up with emotional ups and downs to contesting for the long awaited divorce decree for several months is definitely a tough affair to get through. Before opting for a divorce one should be aware of the fact that a divorce procedure in India extents for almost a year and in some special cases of disputes the procedure may continue for years.\nSince India is a land of varied religious communities having their own marriage laws, the divorce procedure too varies, according to the community of the couple seeking divorce. All Hindus as well as Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains can seek divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act 1955. The Muslim, Christian and Parsi communities, on the other hand, have their own laws governing marriage and divorce. Spouses belonging to different communities and castes can seek divorce under the Special Marriage Act, 1956. There is also the Foreign Marriage Act 1969, governing divorce laws in marriages where either partner belongs to another nationality.\nWith the advancement of time and social awareness, several acts have been passed by the government to make the present day divorce procedure in India more progressive with respect to gender affairs and related sensitive issues.\nDivorce laws in India are broadly categorized into \u2018Divorce by Mutual Consent\u2019, \u2018Contested Divorce\u2019, \u2018Void Marriages\u2019, here is a detailed overview about each of them.\n\n DIVORCE WITH MUTUAL CONSENT\n\nUnder Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, the parties can seek divorce by mutual consent by filing a petition before the court. Mutual consent means that both the parties agree for peaceful separation. Mutual Consent Divorce is a simple way of coming out of the marriage and dissolve it legally. Important requirement is the mutual consent of the husband & wife. There are two aspects on which Husband & Wife have to reach to consensus. One is the alimony or maintenance issues. As per Law there is no minimum or maximum limit of maintenance. It could be any figure or no figure. Next important consideration is the Child Custody. This can also be worked out effectively between the parties. Child Custody in Mutual Consent Divorce can be shared or joint or exclusive depending upon the understanding of the spouses.\nCertain common questions about divorce with mutual consent have been answered below:\nWhen can the divorce by mutual consent be filed?\nThe parties intending to dissolve marriage are required to wait for at least one year from the date of marriage.\nThey have to show that they have been living separately for a period of one year or more before the presentation of the petition for divorce and that during this period of separation they have not been able to live together as husband and wife.\nWhere to file the divorce petition?\nIn the family court of the city / district where both the partners lived together for the last time, which was their matrimonial home.\nHow to file divorce petition by mutual consent? What happens in the court?\nThe\u00a0divorce petition\u00a0is in the form of affidavit, which is to be submitted to the family court. After the filing of the petition and recording the statement of both the parties, the court generally adjourns the matter for a period of 6 months.\nAfter six months the parties have to present themselves again in the court for making a second motion confirming the mutual consent filed earlier. It is only after this second motion that a decree of the divorce is granted by the court.\nCan any one party withdraw the mutual consent petition after filing in the court? What will happen by that?\nDuring this period of 6 months when the petition is pending in the court, any of the partner is fully entitled to withdraw the mutual consent by filing an application before the court stating that he/she does not wish to seek divorce by mutual consent.In such circumstances, the court grants no divorce decree.\nWhat can the other partner do under such circumstances?\nThere is no option available to the other party to such circumstances except to file a normal petition for divorce under the provisions of the Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1950.\nIn such a situation divorce can be granted only on certain specified grounds like cruelty; desertion; voluntary sexual inter-course with another person; the other spouse being of unsound mind; conversion of religion by the other spouse; Leprosy; venereal disease; a spouse having renounced the world or being missing for a period of more than 7 years.\nCan the spouse consent for remarriage without getting divorce from existing partner?\nRemarriage without getting divorce is a punishable offence with seven years\u2019 imprisonment.\nIf either of the spouses is not heard for a long time, should the divorce be applied?\nIf there is proof of the absence of spouse without any information to the other spouse about his whereabouts for a continuous seven years period, a petition should be filed in this regard in the court.\nWhen the divorced persons can remarry?\nDepending on the nature of decree, after the expiry of three months from the date of decree if no notice of appeal is received by the person remarrying from the other person.\nWhat are the costs involved in getting divorce by mutual consent?\nIf you hire an advocate, it will be somewhere from Rs25, 000 to Rs75, 000.\nBut if you get the documentation done by us and file on your own without a lawyer, the cost will be very very low. You will not have any problem in filing your petition with our guidance, and you will save a lot of money.\nHow much time does the whole process take from filing the mutual consent petition in the court till the passing of the decree (judgment) by the court?\nIt takes from six months to one year from the date of filing of the petition. It varies from case to case & place to place.\n\n CONTESTED DIVORCE\n\nIn case of a contested divorce, there are specific grounds on which the petition can be made. It isn\u2019t as if a husband or wife can simply ask for a divorce without stating a reason. The reasons for divorce are as follows, though some are not applicable to all religions.\nCruelty\nCruelty may be physical or mental cruelty. According to the Hindu Divorce Laws in India, if one spouse has a reasonable apprehension in the mind that the other spouse\u2019s conduct is likely to be injurious or harmful, then there is sufficient ground for obtaining divorce due to cruelty by the spouse.\nAdultery\nIn India, a man that commits adultery (i.e. has consensual sexual intercourse outside of marriage) can be charged with a criminal offence. The wife may, of course, file for divorce as a civil remedy. If, on the other hand, a wife commits adultery, she cannot be charged with a criminal offence, though the husband can seek prosecution of the adulterer male for adultery.\nDesertion\nOne spouse deserting the other without reasonable cause (cruelty, for example) is reason for divorce. However, the spouse who abandons the other should intend to desert and there should be proof of it. As per Hindu laws, the desertion should have lasted at least two continuous years. Christians, however, will not be able to file a divorce petition solely for this reason.\nConversion\nDivorce can be sought by a spouse if the other spouse converts to another religion. This reason does not require any time to have passed before divorce can be filed.\nMental Disorder\nIf the spouse is incapable of performing the normal duties required in a marriage on account of mental illness, divorce can be sought. If the mental illness is to such an extent that the normal duties of married life cannot be performed.\nCommunicable Disease\nIf the spouse suffers from a communicable disease, such as HIV/AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea or a virulent and incurable form of leprosy, the Hindu Divorce Laws in India say that the other party can obtain a divorce.\nRenunciation of the World\nif the spouse renounces his/her married life and opts for sanyasa, the aggrieved spouse may obtain a divorce.\nPresumption of Death\nIf the spouse has not been heard of as being alive for a period of at least seven years, by such individuals who would have heard about such spouse, if he or she were alive, then the spouse who is alive can obtain a judicial decree of divorce.\nA few common questions about divorce without mutual consent have been answered:\nWhat are the various steps involved in seeking a contested divorce?\nWith a contested divorce, spouses will have to go through numerous steps before the divorce is finalized, including:\n\nprepare, file and serve (deliver) the divorce petition (legal paperwork asking for the divorce and stating the grounds for the breakdown of the marriage)\nrespond to the petition\ninterview and hire an attorney\nengage in \u201cdivorce discovery\u201d \u2013 the information gathering process, which involves various legal procedures to get information from your spouse and third-party witnesses (e.g., written questions, subpoenas, and depositions)\npre-trial legal motions and hearings\nsettlement proposals and negotiations between attorneys\nif settlement fails, prepare for trial\ncomplete a court trial\nAppeal, if you dispute the trial judge\u2019s decision(s).\n\nDuring the settlement phase, spouses are often unable to resolve issues. Although the divorce judge may encourage spouses to work things out, when that doesn\u2019t happen the next step is divorce court.\nDuring trial, both spouses present witnesses, and their lawyers cross-examine the witnesses and present closing arguments. After trial is over, the court will issue a final order memorializing all of the judge\u2019s decisions, and finalize the divorce.\nWhat are the various documents required to file petition for a contested divorce?\n\nAddress proof of husband2. Address proof of wife3. Marriage certificate4. Four passport size photographs of marriage of husband and wife5. Evidence proving spouses are living separately since more than a year6. Evidence relating to the failed attempts of reconciliation7. Income tax statements for the last 2-3 years8. Details of profession and present remuneration9. Information relating to family background10. Details of properties and other assets owned by the petitioner\n\nWhat is the cost involved in getting a contested divorce?\nLawyers tend to charge fees for appearing in court and doing any other work. Depending on how intensely it is fought, therefore, a divorce may cost anywhere from the low ten thousands to lakhs of rupees.\nWhat are different constraints regarding the alimony?\nThe right of maintenance extends to any person economically dependent on the marriage. This will include, therefore, either spouse, dependent children or even indigent parents.\nThe claim of either spouse (though, in the vast majority of cases, it is the wife), however, depends on the husband having sufficient means. When deciding how much alimony is to be paid, the courts will take into account the earning potential of the husband, his ability to regenerate his fortune (in case, say, the property is given to the wife) and his liabilities. In case either spouse is unable to pay for the divorce, these expenses would also be paid by the spouse that does have an income.\nVarious constraints determining the alimony are:\n\nThe age of the person entitled to receive the alimony.\nThe earnings and current financial status of the spouse entitled to pay the alimony.\nThe failing health or a medical condition of one of the spouses who is going to receive the alimony may act in favor of him or her. They can claim a larger alimony on the basis of their failing health.\nThe spouse that retains custody of the child would be entitled to either pay lesser alimony or be entitled to a greater amount while the child is a minor.\n\nWhat are the provisions relating to child custody?\nCourts usually agree to the decision of the parents in a mutual consent divorce, the courts are expected to see to the best interest of the child. In a contested divorce, the courts will examine the ability of the mother or father to be a parent to the child, for example. Money is not usually a matter that is considered. Non-working mothers are regularly given custody of their children, but fathers are expected to provide financial support.\n\n VOID MARRIAGES\n\nFollowing are the grounds which shall render a marriage void or the court shall deem it to be illegal are:\nBigamy\nNone of the parties to the marriage shall have a spouse living in the time of their marriage. If either of them has a spouse alive from an earlier marriage, their subsequent marriage is no marriage in the eyes of law. It is void ab initio and non-existent.\nPersons falling within degrees of prohibited relationships\nLineal ascendants are to be seen from both sides, i.e. from the father\u2019s side as well as from the mother\u2019s side. So both the father and mother are lineal ascendants fall in degrees of prohibited relationships.\nSapinda relations\nSapinda relations can be illustrated as under:Suppose A is a boy. Now if he is considered as one generation, relatives falling in four more generations upwards from him from the side of his father shall be his Sapinda relations. Therefore, A\u2019s father, A\u2019s grand-father, A\u2019s great grand-father and the father of A\u2019s great grand-father shall all be A\u2019s Sapinda relations. But on the mother\u2019s side, this chain is to extend to only three generations which include A. Therefore, A\u2019s mother and A\u2019s maternal grand-mother only shall be A\u2019s Sapinda relations from the mother\u2019 side, A himself being one generation. Marriages made up of such relationships are void.\nA few common questions about void marriages have been answered below:\nWhat are the provisions relating to maintenance of the wife?\nAnother significant question that now arises is whether the wife whose marriage is void under section 11 of the Act can claim maintenance from her husband of that void marriage. The Supreme Court has held that where a marriage is void, wife cannot claim maintenance under sec. 488 .However it is a generally accepted rule that even in such cases, the wife is entitled to maintenance under sec. 18 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act and also under section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act.\nAre the children born from void marriages legitimate?\nHindu Marriage Act 1955 confers legitimacy upon the children born out of void marriages. It provides as under:Hence the clear effect of section 16 is that if a child is born out of a wedlock which is subsequently declared to be null and void, that child will not be considered illegitimate but he shall be considered legitimate despite the marriage being illegal from its inception. The section provides a cushion to the children of void marriages and prevents them from being penalized."

                "response-text": "Dear Sir,\nIt is the highest ever considered ground to allow your divorce application. Such crocked people not entitled to be adored the status of mother also. Motherhood is such great status but she is not understanding. Your decision is very reasonable.. You may chose any of the following modes of divorce.\n================================================================\nDivorce Laws in India\nDivorce is the legal dissolution of marriage. A divorce is among the most traumatic misfortunes for any couple. The entire process of divorce that starts from coping up with emotional ups and downs to contesting for the long awaited divorce decree for several months is definitely a tough affair to get through. Before opting for a divorce one should be aware of the fact that a divorce procedure in India extents for almost a year and in some special cases of disputes the procedure may continue for years.\nSince India is a land of varied religious communities having their own marriage laws, the divorce procedure too varies, according to the community of the couple seeking divorce. All Hindus as well as Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains can seek divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act 1955. The Muslim, Christian and Parsi communities, on the other hand, have their own laws governing marriage and divorce. Spouses belonging to different communities and castes can seek divorce under the Special Marriage Act, 1956. There is also the Foreign Marriage Act 1969, governing divorce laws in marriages where either partner belongs to another nationality.\nWith the advancement of time and social awareness, several acts have been passed by the government to make the present day divorce procedure in India more progressive with respect to gender affairs and related sensitive issues.\nDivorce laws in India are broadly categorized into \u2018Divorce by Mutual Consent\u2019, \u2018Contested Divorce\u2019, \u2018Void Marriages\u2019, here is a detailed overview about each of them.\n\n DIVORCE WITH MUTUAL CONSENT\n\nUnder Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, the parties can seek divorce by mutual consent by filing a petition before the court. Mutual consent means that both the parties agree for peaceful separation. Mutual Consent Divorce is a simple way of coming out of the marriage and dissolve it legally. Important requirement is the mutual consent of the husband & wife. There are two aspects on which Husband & Wife have to reach to consensus. One is the alimony or maintenance issues. As per Law there is no minimum or maximum limit of maintenance. It could be any figure or no figure. Next important consideration is the Child Custody. This can also be worked out effectively between the parties. Child Custody in Mutual Consent Divorce can be shared or joint or exclusive depending upon the understanding of the spouses.\nCertain common questions about divorce with mutual consent have been answered below:\nWhen can the divorce by mutual consent be filed?\nThe parties intending to dissolve marriage are required to wait for at least one year from the date of marriage.\nThey have to show that they have been living separately for a period of one year or more before the presentation of the petition for divorce and that during this period of separation they have not been able to live together as husband and wife.\nWhere to file the divorce petition?\nIn the family court of the city / district where both the partners lived together for the last time, which was their matrimonial home.\nHow to file divorce petition by mutual consent? What happens in the court?\nThe\u00a0divorce petition\u00a0is in the form of affidavit, which is to be submitted to the family court. After the filing of the petition and recording the statement of both the parties, the court generally adjourns the matter for a period of 6 months.\nAfter six months the parties have to present themselves again in the court for making a second motion confirming the mutual consent filed earlier. It is only after this second motion that a decree of the divorce is granted by the court.\nCan any one party withdraw the mutual consent petition after filing in the court? What will happen by that?\nDuring this period of 6 months when the petition is pending in the court, any of the partner is fully entitled to withdraw the mutual consent by filing an application before the court stating that he/she does not wish to seek divorce by mutual consent.In such circumstances, the court grants no divorce decree.\nWhat can the other partner do under such circumstances?\nThere is no option available to the other party to such circumstances except to file a normal petition for divorce under the provisions of the Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1950.\nIn such a situation divorce can be granted only on certain specified grounds like cruelty; desertion; voluntary sexual inter-course with another person; the other spouse being of unsound mind; conversion of religion by the other spouse; Leprosy; venereal disease; a spouse having renounced the world or being missing for a period of more than 7 years.\nCan the spouse consent for remarriage without getting divorce from existing partner?\nRemarriage without getting divorce is a punishable offence with seven years\u2019 imprisonment.\nIf either of the spouses is not heard for a long time, should the divorce be applied?\nIf there is proof of the absence of spouse without any information to the other spouse about his whereabouts for a continuous seven years period, a petition should be filed in this regard in the court.\nWhen the divorced persons can remarry?\nDepending on the nature of decree, after the expiry of three months from the date of decree if no notice of appeal is received by the person remarrying from the other person.\nWhat are the costs involved in getting divorce by mutual consent?\nIf you hire an advocate, it will be somewhere from Rs25, 000 to Rs75, 000.\nBut if you get the documentation done by us and file on your own without a lawyer, the cost will be very very low. You will not have any problem in filing your petition with our guidance, and you will save a lot of money.\nHow much time does the whole process take from filing the mutual consent petition in the court till the passing of the decree (judgment) by the court?\nIt takes from six months to one year from the date of filing of the petition. It varies from case to case & place to place.\n\n CONTESTED DIVORCE\n\nIn case of a contested divorce, there are specific grounds on which the petition can be made. It isn\u2019t as if a husband or wife can simply ask for a divorce without stating a reason. The reasons for divorce are as follows, though some are not applicable to all religions.\nCruelty\nCruelty may be physical or mental cruelty. According to the Hindu Divorce Laws in India, if one spouse has a reasonable apprehension in the mind that the other spouse\u2019s conduct is likely to be injurious or harmful, then there is sufficient ground for obtaining divorce due to cruelty by the spouse.\nAdultery\nIn India, a man that commits adultery (i.e. has consensual sexual intercourse outside of marriage) can be charged with a criminal offence. The wife may, of course, file for divorce as a civil remedy. If, on the other hand, a wife commits adultery, she cannot be charged with a criminal offence, though the husband can seek prosecution of the adulterer male for adultery.\nDesertion\nOne spouse deserting the other without reasonable cause (cruelty, for example) is reason for divorce. However, the spouse who abandons the other should intend to desert and there should be proof of it. As per Hindu laws, the desertion should have lasted at least two continuous years. Christians, however, will not be able to file a divorce petition solely for this reason.\nConversion\nDivorce can be sought by a spouse if the other spouse converts to another religion. This reason does not require any time to have passed before divorce can be filed.\nMental Disorder\nIf the spouse is incapable of performing the normal duties required in a marriage on account of mental illness, divorce can be sought. If the mental illness is to such an extent that the normal duties of married life cannot be performed.\nCommunicable Disease\nIf the spouse suffers from a communicable disease, such as HIV/AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea or a virulent and incurable form of leprosy, the Hindu Divorce Laws in India say that the other party can obtain a divorce.\nRenunciation of the World\nif the spouse renounces his/her married life and opts for sanyasa, the aggrieved spouse may obtain a divorce.\nPresumption of Death\nIf the spouse has not been heard of as being alive for a period of at least seven years, by such individuals who would have heard about such spouse, if he or she were alive, then the spouse who is alive can obtain a judicial decree of divorce.\nA few common questions about divorce without mutual consent have been answered:\nWhat are the various steps involved in seeking a contested divorce?\nWith a contested divorce, spouses will have to go through numerous steps before the divorce is finalized, including:\n\nprepare, file and serve (deliver) the divorce petition (legal paperwork asking for the divorce and stating the grounds for the breakdown of the marriage)\nrespond to the petition\ninterview and hire an attorney\nengage in \u201cdivorce discovery\u201d \u2013 the information gathering process, which involves various legal procedures to get information from your spouse and third-party witnesses (e.g., written questions, subpoenas, and depositions)\npre-trial legal motions and hearings\nsettlement proposals and negotiations between attorneys\nif settlement fails, prepare for trial\ncomplete a court trial\nAppeal, if you dispute the trial judge\u2019s decision(s).\n\nDuring the settlement phase, spouses are often unable to resolve issues. Although the divorce judge may encourage spouses to work things out, when that doesn\u2019t happen the next step is divorce court.\nDuring trial, both spouses present witnesses, and their lawyers cross-examine the witnesses and present closing arguments. After trial is over, the court will issue a final order memorializing all of the judge\u2019s decisions, and finalize the divorce.\nWhat are the various documents required to file petition for a contested divorce?\n\nAddress proof of husband2. Address proof of wife3. Marriage certificate4. Four passport size photographs of marriage of husband and wife5. Evidence proving spouses are living separately since more than a year6. Evidence relating to the failed attempts of reconciliation7. Income tax statements for the last 2-3 years8. Details of profession and present remuneration9. Information relating to family background10. Details of properties and other assets owned by the petitioner\n\nWhat is the cost involved in getting a contested divorce?\nLawyers tend to charge fees for appearing in court and doing any other work. Depending on how intensely it is fought, therefore, a divorce may cost anywhere from the low ten thousands to lakhs of rupees.\nWhat are different constraints regarding the alimony?\nThe right of maintenance extends to any person economically dependent on the marriage. This will include, therefore, either spouse, dependent children or even indigent parents.\nThe claim of either spouse (though, in the vast majority of cases, it is the wife), however, depends on the husband having sufficient means. When deciding how much alimony is to be paid, the courts will take into account the earning potential of the husband, his ability to regenerate his fortune (in case, say, the property is given to the wife) and his liabilities. In case either spouse is unable to pay for the divorce, these expenses would also be paid by the spouse that does have an income.\nVarious constraints determining the alimony are:\n\nThe age of the person entitled to receive the alimony.\nThe earnings and current financial status of the spouse entitled to pay the alimony.\nThe failing health or a medical condition of one of the spouses who is going to receive the alimony may act in favor of him or her. They can claim a larger alimony on the basis of their failing health.\nThe spouse that retains custody of the child would be entitled to either pay lesser alimony or be entitled to a greater amount while the child is a minor.\n\nWhat are the provisions relating to child custody?\nCourts usually agree to the decision of the parents in a mutual consent divorce, the courts are expected to see to the best interest of the child. In a contested divorce, the courts will examine the ability of the mother or father to be a parent to the child, for example. Money is not usually a matter that is considered. Non-working mothers are regularly given custody of their children, but fathers are expected to provide financial support.\n\n VOID MARRIAGES\n\nFollowing are the grounds which shall render a marriage void or the court shall deem it to be illegal are:\nBigamy\nNone of the parties to the marriage shall have a spouse living in the time of their marriage. If either of them has a spouse alive from an earlier marriage, their subsequent marriage is no marriage in the eyes of law. It is void ab initio and non-existent.\nPersons falling within degrees of prohibited relationships\nLineal ascendants are to be seen from both sides, i.e. from the father\u2019s side as well as from the mother\u2019s side. So both the father and mother are lineal ascendants fall in degrees of prohibited relationships.\nSapinda relations\nSapinda relations can be illustrated as under:Suppose A is a boy. Now if he is considered as one generation, relatives falling in four more generations upwards from him from the side of his father shall be his Sapinda relations. Therefore, A\u2019s father, A\u2019s grand-father, A\u2019s great grand-father and the father of A\u2019s great grand-father shall all be A\u2019s Sapinda relations. But on the mother\u2019s side, this chain is to extend to only three generations which include A. Therefore, A\u2019s mother and A\u2019s maternal grand-mother only shall be A\u2019s Sapinda relations from the mother\u2019 side, A himself being one generation. Marriages made up of such relationships are void.\nA few common questions about void marriages have been answered below:\nWhat are the provisions relating to maintenance of the wife?\nAnother significant question that now arises is whether the wife whose marriage is void under section 11 of the Act can claim maintenance from her husband of that void marriage. The Supreme Court has held that where a marriage is void, wife cannot claim maintenance under sec. 488 .However it is a generally accepted rule that even in such cases, the wife is entitled to maintenance under sec. 18 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act and also under section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act.\nAre the children born from void marriages legitimate?\nHindu Marriage Act 1955 confers legitimacy upon the children born out of void marriages. It provides as under:Hence the clear effect of section 16 is that if a child is born out of a wedlock which is subsequently declared to be null and void, that child will not be considered illegitimate but he shall be considered legitimate despite the marriage being illegal from its inception. The section provides a cushion to the children of void marriages and prevents them from being penalized."

Speak to the parents of the girl and educate them about the law and also tell them that your daughter will be imprisoned since she will be treated as Major and Boy as Minor.\n2.

The high court had restored the women to her father.\nBut the Supreme Court ruled that it was sufficient to note that Thushara and Nandakumar were adults.\n\"Even if they were not competent to enter into wedlock (which position itself is disputed), they have right to live together even outside wedlock,\" a bench of Justices AK Sikri and Ashok Bhushan said.\nThe top court noted that the legislature had also recognised \"live-in relationship\" which has been covered under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005.\n\"It needs no special emphasis to state that attaining the age of majority in an individual's life has its own significance,\" the court ruled, elaborating that adults were entitled to make their choices.\n\"The courts cannot, as long as the choice remains, assume the role of parens patriae (a Latin term that literally translates to parent of the nation),\" the judges said. In legalese, it is the doctrine that grants the state its power to protect people who are legally unable to act on their own behalf. Like minors.\nIt also cited the Hadiya verdict that concluded the court could not assume the \"role of a super guardian\" for adults.\nHadiya's marriage to a Muslim man, Shafin Jahan, was annulled by the Kerala High Court last year after her father alleged that she had been brainwashed and forced to convert. The father's version was cited by right wing groups to label it as \"love jihad\", a term used by them to accuse Muslim men of trapping and marrying Hindu women to recruit them for terror.\n==========================================================================\nhttp://www.wcd.nic.in/policies/child-marriage-restraint-act1929\n==========================================================================\nThe Child Marriage Restraint Act,1929\nThe Child Marriage Restraint Act,1929\n(19 of 1929)\nAn Act to restrain the solemnisation of child marriage. \nSection 1 : Short title extent and commencement --\nThis Act may be called the Child Marriage Restraint Act, (1929).\nIt extends to the whole of India (except the State of Jammu and Kashmir) and it applies also to all citizen of India without and beyond India.\nIt shall come into force on the 1st day of April, 1930.\nSection 2: Definitions -- In this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context:\n\"Child\" means a person who, if a male, has not completed twenty one year of age, and if a female, has not completed eighteen years of age;\n\"child marriage\" means a marriage to which either of the contracting parties is a child;\n\"contracting party\" to a marriage means either of the parties whose marriage is (or is about to be) thereby solemnised and\n\"minor\" means a person of either sex who is under eighteen years of age.\nSection 3: Punishment for male adult below twenty one years of age marrying a child -- Whoever, being a male above eighteen years of age and below twenty one, contracts a child marriage shall be punishable with simple imprisonment which may extend to fifteen days, or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with both.\nSection 4: Punishment for male adult above twenty one years of age marrying a child -- Whoever, being a male above twenty one years of age, contracts a child marriage shall be punishable with simple imprisonment which may extend to three months and shall also be liable to fine.\nSection 5: Punishment for solemnising a child marriage -- (1) Whoever performs, conducts or directs any child marriage shall be punishable with simple imprisonment which may extend to three months and shall also be liable to fine unless he proves that he had reason to believe that the marriage was not a child -marriage.\nSection 6: Punishment for parent or guardian concerned in a child marriage --\nWhere a minor contracts a child marriage, any person having charge of the minor, whether as parent or guardian or in any other capacity, lawful or unlawful, who does any act to promote the marriage or permits it to be solemnised, or negligently fails to prevent it from being solemnised, shall be punishable with simple imprisonment which may extend to three months and shall also be liable to fine.\nProvided no woman shall be punishable with imprisonment.\nFor the purpose of this section, it shall be presumed unless and until the contrary is proved, that where a minor has contracted a child marriage, the person having charge of such minor has negligently failed to prevent marriage from being solemnised.\nSection 7: Offences to be cognizable for certain purposes.

                "response-text": "Dear Sir,\nThe following information may kindly be read. It will helpful to you.\nWhen A Boy And Girl Elope, Girl\u2019s Family Often Files Complaints Of Rape And Kidnapping. What Can The Boy Do In Such Circumstances?\nWhat is Elopement?\n\u2022\tElopement is nothing but an act of running away for the purpose of getting married which could be for various reasons. However, elopement could also be viewed as a marriage concluded in a very secretive, unexpected and sudden manner. It generally involves a very fast and expeditious running away from one\u2019s place cooperatively with one\u2019s loved one with an aim or plan of getting married.\n\u2022\tIn India, it is usually witnessed that an act of elopement takes place for the reason that the people who intend to get married want to avoid different kinds of objection from parents and relatives or religious barriers. In India, for an elopement to be valid and legal, it is necessary that both the parties involved must be major according to law (Minimum age of 21 years for a boy and 18 years for a girl) and the elopement must be consensual. There must not be the presence of any kind of force or threat in order to get the elopement accomplished. An act of elopement is often followed by immense actions and attempts by the parents and relatives of the parties involved in the elopement for threatening, grievously hurting or even killing the boy and the girl involved (mostly boy).\n\u2022\tIt is not very rare to come across some grave and disturbing consequences of elopement. The outcome of elopement can sometimes be really profound. However, if the elopement is valid and lawful then the law and legal system of our country certainly ensure the best for the concerned couple.\nAn Outlook\nIn the cases where a boy and a girl elope for the purpose of getting married, two elements play the most important role in determining whether there is a commission of any criminal offense from the end of the boy or not. Those two elements are:\n\u2022\tConsent, and\n\u2022\tAge of the girl\nThere are various legal perspectives with reference to the instances where a boy and a girl elope for the purpose of marriage under varied circumstances. Further, in this article, different situations under which a boy and a girl can elope in order to get married are discussed with its legal lookout which would, in the final analysis, help us determine whether the boy involved can be charged for any criminal offense or not.\nCases where the girl is a major and elopes with her consent\n\u2022\tIn the instances where the boy and girl elope for the reason of getting married and both boy and girl are major (boy must be more than 21 and girl must be more than 18) and have eloped with mutual consent (where the girl has also given her valid consent), such act would not be considered as any legal offence. In such cases, the boy and the girl would be free to get married in accordance with the legal provisions of our country. No charges of rape, kidnapping or abduction can be filed against the boy in such instances.\n\u2022\tIn accordance with the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, which is the most vital Act regulating the marriage of minors, states that in order to get married lawfully the minimum age of a girl must be 18 years and the same of a boy must be 21 years. Therefore, in the instances where a boy and a girl who are major, elope for the purpose of getting married consensually, no legal action can follow against the boy as the boy as well as the girl qualify the minimum requirement set by the aforesaid Act.\n\u2022\tAccording to the 2013 Criminal Law (Amendment) Act and the Protection of Children against Sexual Offences (POSCO), the minimum age for giving consent of sex in India is 18 years. Therefore, no charges of rape can be framed against the boy in the cases where a boy and a girl who are major according to the law, elope with consent.\n\u2022\tHowever, as a matter of fact, it is witnessed very usually in India that whenever any act where a girl and a boy elope for the purpose of getting married takes place, regardless of the fact whether that act is a criminal offence or not, the parents or the concerned relatives of the girl go on to file the case of rape, kidnapping, and abduction against the boy. In such a case, if the elopement is not unlawful, the boy can ask for police protection or can go to the concerned High Court for seeking protection. The boy and girl can also get married under the Special Marriage Act.\n\u2022\tIt is also advisable in such cases that as soon as the marriage takes place lawfully, the girl should go on to file a complaint against the concerned people who are willing to hurt the boy in order to ensure the safety and well being of both of them.\n\u2022\tAs long as the consent given by the girl involved is valid and she is a major, no legal actions can be taken against the involved boy. In such a case, even if the relatives of the concerned girl file the cases of the kidnapping, rape or abduction against the boy, he would be safe.\n\u2022\tThere is nothing one can do in order to stop someone from lodging a complaint against an act of elopement irrespective of its validity, but if the elopement is valid and lawful then it becomes much uncomplicated to deal with the complaint or the issue. Doing away with such a matter would not be difficult for the boy and the girl involved if the elopement is not against the legal provisions. The girl or the wife involved in the elopement can go on to register a report with the local police station conveying that she has eloped with the boy with her own consent and volition and no undue force or threat has been used by the boy against her in order to conclude the elopement, and she also realises that her parents or other relatives may take threatening and hurting steps against her husband. This would ensure the safety of both of them.\nCases where the girl is a major but elopes without her consent\n\u2022\tIn the cases where a boy and a girl run away for the purpose of getting married and the girl is a major but her consent is absent, the boy involved can be charged for kidnapping, abduction and even rape.\n\u2022\tConsent is one of the most important elements for the determination of the fact whether any act of elopement is against law or not. If there is an absence of the consent of the girl involved in an elopement, such an act would be considered as a criminal offense and the boy involved in such an act would be punished.\n\u2022\tIn such cases, a complaint under Section 366 of the Indian Penal Code will be filed against the boy involved in the elopement. This section has provisions against a person who kidnaps or abducts any girl in order to compel her marriage without her consent. This section clearly states that any person who kidnaps or abducts a girl with an intention of compelling her to get married without her consent would be charged and punished.\n\u2022\tInstances, where a boy compels a girl to run away with him for the purpose of marriage without her valid consent, would be considered as a criminal offense. Such acts are certainly unlawful.\n\u2022\tCharges under section 362 which provides for abduction can also be filed in such cases, at the same time charges for rape can as well be imposed on the boy involved.\n\u2022\tThe boy involved in such a case might be entitled to an imprisonment for up to ten years along with fine as a punishment.\nCases where the girl is a minor and elopes with her consent\n\u2022\tConsent becomes immaterial if the elopement involves a minor girl. In the instances where a girl and a boy run away in order to get married and the girl involved is a minor, the boy would be held liable for the commission of criminal offense regardless of the consent given by the girl.\n\u2022\tThe law says that a minor is not competent enough for giving consent. Therefore, any consent given by a girl in order to conclude an elopement would be invalid and the boy involved in such elopement could be charged for the commission of kidnapping, abduction or rape in accordance with the provisions of sections 362, 366 and 375 of the Indian Penal Code.\n\u2022\tThe boy involved in such an elopement would be entitled to punishments as specified by the Indian Penal Code for the commission of offenses like rape, kidnapping, and abduction.\nCases where the girl is a minor and elopes without her consent\n\u2022\tInstances of elopement in which a minor girl elopes with a boy without her consent are very serious criminal offense. It could lead to destruct and devastate the lives of many innocent little girls. This offense also has a huge potentiality of contributing to the other serious offenses such as human trafficking and forced prostitution.\n\u2022\tAny boy involved in the act of making or compelling a minor girl to elope with him without her consent would be liable for punishment under the provisions against kidnapping, abduction, and rape as specified by the Indian Penal Code.\nPreventive and Safety Measures\nIn order to tackle and confront all the actions and attempts made by the concerned relatives for threatening, harming or killing the boy or the girl involved in the elopement, following steps can be taken:\n\u2022\tThe couple can approach the respective High Court of their state demanding protection against the actions or attempts which might be committed against them in order to hurt or kill them.\n\u2022\tThe wife or the girl involved in the elopement can go on to file a complaint in the concerned police station confessing that she had eloped with the boy or her husband with her own will and consent and there was no force or threat used by the boy or her husband against her in order to accomplish the elopement, and she anticipates that her parents and relatives may take hurt, threaten or even kill her husband."

She was a central government official working as an accountant in Postal department at the time of her death.  The following properties are her self-earned properties: \r\n\u2022\tA house which is constructed on a site of 30/40 dimension in Bangalore.\r\n\u2022\tA site of 30/40 dimension in Bangalore. \r\n\u2022\tAlong with this, her movables like her death benefits, retairals, jewels, deposits, investments which are in the custody of my father.\r\n\r\n3.\t My mother died because of Cancer. She had a tumor in her uterus which was cancerous and had metastated into secondary tumors, spreading into her brain. The doctors had concluded that no treatment could save her. She was not in conscious for a few days but on 10th of October 2010, she regained her conscious and declared an oral will in front of the family members namely her husband (my  father),  Son (my brother) Her mother (my Grandmother) and her sister (my aunt) in my absence. She pronounced that the property needs to be shared equally between her son and daughter i.e. between me and my brother in the ratio of 50:50. There is no will that was made for this oral declaration of hers. Later my aunt and grandmother informed me the same about my mother\u2019s will.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Questions:\r\n1.\tWhat is my share in the above said Ancestral Property? Can I claim my share through partition suite now, even when my father is still alive?\r\n2.\tWhat is my share in my mother\u2019s said property?\r\n3.\tCan the witnesses be summoned by the court, for the oral will made by my mother? Will it stand as a witness in the court?\r\n4.\tCan I get share of 50% of the property in accordance of the oral will of my mother?\r\n5.\tIn addition to this, since my mother was a Central Government Employee, her pension is been taken by my father post her death. My father also gets his pension as he was a State Bank \r\nEmployee. Do I have a share in my mother\u2019s pension? If so, what is my share?\r\nKindly request you to do the needful.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nThejaswini.",

In view of Section 57 read with Schedule III of the Act, requirements of Section 63 must be complied with and are mandatory for a Will executed by a Hindu. A Will which does not comply with the requirement of Section 63 of the Act is null and void. Clause (a) to Section 63 requires a Will should be in writing because it is to be signed or marked by the testator himself or signed by some other person in the presence of the Testator or on his direction. A Will, as per Section 63, is also required to be attested by two or more witnesses. Thus Section 63 of the Act requires a Will to be in writing."

It can be created in such towns , by deposit of title-deeds, even though the property is situated outside those towns.\n (ii) It is effected by deposit of material title-deeds. It is not necessary that all the deeds should be deposited. It is sufficient if material documents are deposited.\n(iii) Delivery of possession of property does not take place.\n(iv) This mortgage is made to secure a debt or advances made, or to cover future advances.\n(v) Registration is not necessary, even if there is a writing recording the deposit under section 59.\n(vi) This mortgage prevails against a subsequent transferee who takes under a registered instrument.\n(vii) This mortgage prevails against all who are not bona fide purchasers for value without notice.\n3) So in essence during the subsistence of mortgage, you should not transfer the title of the property without No objection certificate issued by the bank and \n4) In absence of transfer of property without intimation to bank and banks are at liberty to frame criminal charges against you and your father as the transfer by you in favour of your father is a fraudulent transfer u/s 53.of Transfer of property act which reads as follows\n Fraudulent transfer. - (1) Every transfer of immovable property made with intent to defeat or delay the creditors of the transferor shall be voidable at the option of any creditor so defeated or delayed.\n5) Any transfer of immovable property made with intent to defeat or delay the creditors of the transferors and transfer made without consideration with intent to defraud a subsequent transferee are void and at the option of the subsequent transferee is voidable\n6) So the settlement deed is actually VOID in the eyes of the bank as the loan agreement still exists and as per bank records, you are the owner of the property. \n7) Now the options available to you are \na) either you foreclose the loan and make your father the owner of the property\n OR\nb) Cancel the settlement deed(you and your father can jointly cancel the settlement deed) \nAlso ensure that your loan account does not become NPA till such time you rectify the issue."

Even whilst removing the said interior/infrastructure, the tenant is liable to pay for damages/refurbishing to owners.\n8) You can write to Registrar of about the fraud and forgery of the tenant in submitting the fabricated NOC and the certificate of incorporation will be cancelled by ROC. \n9) You can also prosecute the tenant as well the newly registered private limited company under section 415 (Fraud), section 406(criminal breach of trust), Section 441(Trespass) read with section 120 of IPC by filing a complaint with the police station or a private complaint under section 200 Cr.P.C in the criminal court. \n10) A photocopy of rental agreement of 11 months duration is valid in eyes of law. So no need to worry on this front. If the tenant denies the photocopy of rental agreement, it will actually be to your advantage and you can sue him and claim enhanced rentals, compensation and damages etc. \nHope this information is useful."

Father has son and daughter. Father has registered gift deed in favor of his son in 2021. Now I am planning to buy the property from his son. Son has one elder sister. Father is still alive. Only son is available to sign the sale deed. \r\n\r\nSon is hesitant and not willing to call his sister for witness signature. He is ready to drop the deal than to call her. They claim that Father has bought the property with his own income. They also say that father has shared similar properties to his daughter. So there will be no issues with her in any means. \r\n\r\nI liked the property very much. Is it safe to go ahead and buy the property without consent witness of his sister or father? Gift deed is clear without any special conditions. Please suggest.",

The consent of the sister is not necessary and if she challenges then u can just contest the case and her suit will be dismissed. The law is as follows:\n\u00a0\nCancelling a Gift:\nSection 126 provides two modes of revocation of Gift:-\n\nRevocation by mutual agreement:- A gift may be revoked upon the happening of an event which is not dependent on the donor where the donor and donee may agree. The revocation must be in express form and not of a wish or desire.Revocation by rescission:- The gift is a transfer of ownership without any exchange of money or any consideration which is made voluntarily. So, where there is no free consent of the parties, the gift can be revoked or if it is obtained by coercion, undue influence or fraud then the gift is voidable.\n\nCASE\n\u201cS. Sarojini Amma v. Velayudhan Pillai Sreekumar\u00a02018 SCC OnLine SC 2200\u201d\n\u201cIn this case, the Supreme Court observed that there was no completed gift of the property which is in question to the respondent by the appellant and the appellant had right in cancelling the deed.\u201d\nConclusion:\nThe Transfer of Property Act, 1882 lays down provisions relating to gift deed and cancellation of the gift deed. Any person who is the real owner of the property can transfer his or her property to anyone by way of gift. A gift deed actually says that any person who is the owner of the property can transfer the property to another person without any consideration. Similarly, there are provisions for cancellation of the gift deed as well."

The standard of proof in \"proceedings under the Act being initially of a civil nature is by preponderance of, probabilities and not by proving it beyond reasonable doubt\n\u00a0\nA Hindu woman's right to maintenance is a personal obligation so far as the husband is concerned, and it is his duty to maintain her even if he has no property. It is well settled that under the Hindu Law, the husband has got a personal obligation to maintain his wife and if he is possessed of properties then his wife is entitled to a right to be maintained out of such properties.A minor child is entitled to get maintenance from the father if during the divorce preceding the custody of child has been awarded to the mother or otherwise also.They can claim maintenance in future for their education and marriage expenses under the Hindu Adoption and\u00a0Maintenance Act, 1956.\n\u00a0\nThe Supreme Court of India has held that no fixed formula can be laid for fixing the amount of maintenance. It has to be in the nature of things which depend on various facts and circumstances of each case. The court has to consider the status of the parties, their respective needs, the capacity of the husband to pay, having regard to reasonable expenses for his own maintenance and others whom he is obliged to maintain under the law and statute."

Then she operated our joint locker without my consent and took away all her gold and my family gold as well.\r\nThen in March,2015 filed for mutual consent under 13B-HMA and took Rs.7 lacs out of the settled 30 lacs and handed over the daughter's custody to me in front of the hon'ble judge and we jointly suffered statement for the same. Then in August,2015 illegally took away my daughter from my home when she was playing in vicinity and kidnapped her with help of her parents and maternal uncle. And the second motion which was in Septembe,2015, just out of the court she demanded more money to which i denied and she suffered statement that she doesnt want to divorce me. The hon'ble judge told her to return money to me which she had taken at first motion. she took date but never came back. Then i filed police complaint for kidnapping and fraud but she refused to settle with me and police officials made reports in my favour and reports were forwarded to Commissioner of police for proceedings to file FIR. this episode happened in month of january,2016. and the 13B-HMA was still on as i requested dates. While the 13B case was still pending, she moved a complaint for dowry and harrassment against me n my parents and other family members in the WomenCell police station. But in the meantime when she came to know that report of filing FIR against her for kidnapping and fraud has been made and was sent to CP office for approval, then in February,2016 he returned me my money in 13B-HMA case and said she doesnt want to divorce, so finally the case was dismissed as unfructuous. After 07 days of this, Police filed FIR against her and her parents and maternal uncle under section [deleted]B IPC. She filed for enquiry on FIR and police made reports for cancellation of FIR somehow. Now a complaint against me and parents in pending in WomenCell PS. Though no such dowry was demanded and taken and no harassment and watsoever was done, but still Police says that they may file FIR against me. and also She was put up application in High Court Punjab for Quashing of the FIR. My question is Number 1- Is there any way out of the womencell complaint. and Number 2 - would High Court quash the FIR. Because she is a woman and a mother, means the law is all in her favour.

My brother married someone he chose (love marriage) around 5 years ago. Ever since his wedding, he has been facing some issues in his family (all related to spending money). Every small issue was blown out of proportions by his in-law's family (his wife lost her father a couple of years before marriage and is supported by her mother and elder brother, who is also married with 2 kids). Both my brother and his wife had a personal agreement and chose to live a child-free life until any one or both of them change their minds. The issues were not only about spending their own money, but there also seems to be some jealousy involved. Things blew up when both myself and my brother's elder sibling bought a new car. Brother's in-law claimed that my brother's parents bought a car for their elder son but not the younger one (the one we're discussing about now). My brother continued to tolerate everything until now.\r\n\r\nRecently, when the usual issues kept building up, both the families agreed to sit and talk it out. But, as soon as the talks started, his wife's mother went on to hit both of my brother's parents. After they left, he informed us about this and we also came to know that his brother-in-law threatened him with an iron rod hidden inside his bag. Talking about my brother's past, he informed us that his in-laws family had been threatening him for the past years that they won't hesitate to proceed legally or illegally since they (claim to) have influence. \r\n\r\nAfter knowing all this, with the advice of a local lawyer, we complained in the nearby police station. The girl's placed some allegations such as no kid for 5 years and some false ones too like harrasment from my brother's dad and dowry. The sub-inspector gave councelling for a day or two and closed this issue. He also pointed out the fact that, his mother-in-law was wrong to hit someone when everyone had agreed to just talk the issues out. Even after this, his wife assaulted him in their home at night and also blackmailed of committing suicide. This was handled by my brother by immediately calling \"100\" for police and a patrol troop was sent to calm everything down.\r\n\r\nMy brother has had enough and wants to get out of this relationship. We were adviced by another lawyer that giving a divorce notice so soon after the counselling might be turned against us and to wait for a month or two and then decide. Please let us know if now would be a good time to proceed for the divorce. Whenever we are proceeding, what are the actions/allegations we can expect from the girl's side?",

Section 13 contemplates further revision to the Revenue Divisional Officer either on the application of a party or in his own motion.\n4) In view of the proviso to section 14, if any person is aggrieved over the entry made in the patta pass book in respect of any property over which he claims title and also possession, he can only file a suit for declaration of his right and thereafter, the entry in the patta pass book can be amended in accordance with any such declaration made by the competent civil court. \n5) your option is to move competent civil court and file a civil suit for declaration.\n6) Only when a decree is granted, the Revenue Authority can act according to the decree and make necessary changes in the patta pass book."

Out of the total extent of 2.02 Acres, an extent of 82 cents was acquired by the Government for formation of a bye pass road and the balance extent of 1.20 Acre was reclassified as ward 'F' Block 10, T.S.No.5/4c1 and ward 'F' Block 10, T.S.No.5/4c2. The said property is in possession and enjoyment of the petitioner for more than 40 years and patta also stands in the name of the petitioner under patta No.949. When 82 cents of land was acquired, the first respondent herein paid compensation to the petitioner and therefore, the title over the said property under Survey No.205/4 measuring 1 Acre 20 cents is accepted by the first respondent and therefore he is estopped from denying it. Likewise an extent of 86 cents at Survey No.205/5 was also acquired for the formation of bye pass road from the husband of the 5th respondent and the father of the respondents 6 to 9. The petitioner and the father of the respondents 6 to 9, namely, Late. T.R.Subbaraj are brothers. His brother, namely, one late.T.R.Subbaraj never objected to the payment of compensation to the petitioner in respect of Survey No.205/4. It is further stated by the petitioner that the 4th respondent approached the petitioner for the lease of a portion of land at Survey No.205/4 and accordingly, a lease deed was executed on 02.08.1993. The said lease is for 15 years and the 4th respondent was running a Petrol Bunk, as tenant of the petitioner. However, the 4th respondent got a sale deed executed in respect of the said property from the respondents 6 to 8 as if they are the owners of the said property. Therefore, the petitioner filed a suit in O.S.No.63 of 2006 on the file of the District Munsif Court, Aruppukottai for declaration and mandatory injunction. However, the respondents 4, 6 to 8 approached the respondents 1 and 2 and sought for cancellation of patta as well as mutation of the records. The second respondent rightly refused to effect any mutation on the ground that the civil suit is pending with regard to the title. On the other hand, the first respondent by way of the impugned order dated 24.07.2006 cancelled the patta which stood in the name of the petitioner and consequently, granted the patta in favour of the respondents 4, 6, 7 and 8 for survey No.205/4 measuring an extent of 1.20 Acre. Hence, the writ petition is filed by the petitioner. It is also stated by the petitioner that the 3rd respondent has acted illegally and therefore, an enquiry has to be ordered against him to be conducted by the Vigilance and Anti Corruption Department, namely, the 10th respondent herein.\n3.Notice of motion was ordered by this Court on 16.11.2006 and after notice, the respondents entered appearance. The first respondent was arrayed in his personal capacity as 3rd respondent. The first respondent has not filed any counter. However, when this Court has directed the first respondent to produce the file relating to this case, he filed an affidavit and stated that the file was destroyed in the year 2011, after obtaining the approval of the Revenue Divisional Officer through his proceedings dated 13.06.2004 as it is the practice to destroy three years old files.\n4.The third respondent filed a counter affidavit and stated that he had discharged his function and co-operated with the authorities and absolutely there are no motives. In respect of survey Nos.205/4 and 205/5 the petition was filed on 22.08.2005 and 06.03.2006 seeking transfer of patta. After issuing notice and after considering the objection filed by the parties, the third respondent passed final order on 24.07.2006. It is also contended by the third respondent that the suit filed by the petitioner in O.S.No.63 of 2006 is in respect of an extend of 36 cents in survey No.205/4c, whereas, the transfer of patta proceedings relates to total extent of 3.31 Acre Survey No.205/4 and 5 and therefore, the petitioner cannot claim that the civil suit covered the entire property. He has rendered more than 20 years of service without any adverse orders. Accordingly, the third respondent is totally an unnecessary party to be impleaded in his individual capacity.\n5.The 4th respondent has filed a counter affidavit and stated that an extent of 2 Acres and 2 cents at survey No.205/4C belonged to late T.S.Subbaraj, the father of respondents 5 to 9 and the petitioner never owned the said land at any point of time . The original patta stood in the name of Late T.R.Subbaraj from 1958. The 4th respondent believed that the petitioner was the owner and consequently, entered into lease agreement on 02.08.1993 and after coming to know that the property does not belong to the petitioner, the 4th respondent purchased an extent of 59 cents from the respondents 5 to 7 for valuable consideration on 21.06.2001. It is also contended by the 4th respondent that the Petitioner had already filed a suit in O.S.No.63 of 2006 for declaration and other relief, and the same is pending. It is further contended by the 4th respondent that the order of the first respondent impugned in this writ petition has not been challenged by way of an appeal. Moreover, the said order passed by the first respondent was only in pursuant to full fledged enquiry and after affording opportunity to all the parties concerned. The petitioner having appeared before the first respondent cannot say that he was deprived of an opportunity before passing of the impugned order.\n6.The respondents 5 to 9 filed a counter affidavit and contended that as against the order passed by the first respondent there is an appeal remedy and without exhausting the same the writ petition filed by the petitioner is not maintainable. It is further contended by the respondents 6 to 9 that the petitioner never owned property in Survey Nos.205/4, 205/5 and though the patta No.949 stood in the name of the petitioner for quite some time, the original patta stood only in the name of the father of the respondents 6 to 9, namely, T.R.Subbaraj way back in the year 1958. The petitioner having invoked jurisdiction of civil court and filed a declaration suit, it is not open to the petitioner to maintain the above writ petition. It is further contended by the respondents 5 to 9 that the first respondent had conducted a full-fledged enquiry and after analysing the documents filed by both the parties had rightly passed the order thereby cancelling the patta in the name of the petitioner and granted patta in the name of the respondents 4, 5 to 9.\n7.The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner argued that the petitioner is the owner of survey No.204 measuring an extent of 2 Acre 2 cents, out of which, 82 cents of land was acquired under the Land Acquisition Act for formation of the bye pass road and the first respondent himself had given the compensation to the petitioner in respect of survey No.204. Therefore, according to the learned counsel for the petitioner, the title over the survey No.204 in favour of the petitioner had been accepted by the first respondent and consequently, he is estopped from denying the title of the petitioner and thereby cancelling the patta. The learned Counsel further argued that the first respondent has got no jurisdiction to decide the title over the property, especially while dealing with patta proceedings. It is further contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the first respondent has got no jurisdiction to transfer the patta or cancel the patta and it is only the Tashildar, who is empowered under the Patta Pass Book Act to do the same. The learned counsel further argued that as the order passed by the first respondent himself is without jurisdiction, there is no question of filing any appeal under the Patta Pass Book Act against the order of first respondent. The learned counsel also further argued that the 3rd respondent was arrayed in his individual capacity, who was the Revenue Divisional Officer at the time of passing the present impugned order and he had acted with malice and passed the impugned order on the eve of his transfer. Therefore, an enquiry has to be conducted by the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Department against the 3rd respondent. The learned Counsel also prayed for exemplary cost against the 3rd respondent. In support of his contention, the learned counsel relied on the following decisions:-\n1. AIR 1954 SC 340 (Kiran Singh vs. Chaman Paswan) 2.2011(2) CWC 242 (Vishwas Footwear Company Ltd., v. The District Collector and others).\n3.AIR 1994 SC 787 (Lucknow Development Authority v. M.K.Gupta). 4.2000(2) SCC 465 (Chairman, Railway Board v. Chandrima Das) 5.2010 CIJ 245 (1) (Tamil Sakthi vs. State of Tamil Nadu and others)\n8.Per contra, the learned Special Government Pleader appearing for the first respondent argued that the impugned order was made pursuant to the direction issued by the District Collector, based on the representation made by the parties. The learned Special Government Pleader further argued that the first respondent has got jurisdiction to pass the impugned order under the Patta Pass Book Act.\n9.The learned Counsel appearing for the respondents 5 to 9 argued that the order passed by the first respondent has to be treated only an order passed in appeal because as against the order passed by the Tashildar an appeal lies to the Revenue Divisional Officer. Therefore, the first respondent has got every jurisdiction to pass the order impugned in this writ petition. The power to cancel the patta lies with the Revenue Divisional Officer and therefore, the order passed is presently valid. In support of his contention, the learned counsel relied on a decision reported in 2011(2) CWC 242 in the matter of Vishwas Footwear Company Ltd., v. The District Collector and others.\n10.The learned counsel appearing for the 3rd respondent argued that there are no averments in the affidavit filed in support of the writ petition with regard to any corruption or malice against the 3rd respondent. The learned counsel has also argued that the petitioner had not questioned the jurisdiction of the first respondent, but, on the other hand, he filed objection before him and thereafter, only the impugned order came to be passed. Therefore, according to the 3rd respondent, the petitioner having filed objection before the first respondent is estopped from questioning the jurisdiction. In support of his contention, the learned counsel for the 3rd respondent relied on the judgment reported in 2011(2) CWC 242 in the matter of Vishwas Footwear Company Ltd., v. The District Collector and others. 2011(5) CTC 241 in the matter of C.Sabesan Chettiar vs. The District Revenue Officer, Coimbatore District.\n11.Heard the learned Counsels appearing for the respective parties.\n12.In this case, the petitioner has challenged the order of the first respondent dated 24.07.2006. In the said order, the first respondent has cancelled the patta standing in the name of the petitioner in respect of Survey No.205/4 and consequently, transferred the patta in the name of the respondents 4 to 9. While passing the said order, the first respondent has found that the petitioner has not produced any document of title in support of his claim over the said property. In this case, admittedly, a patta was standing in the name of the petitioner under Patta No.949 in respect of survey No.205/4. The said patta was cancelled by the first respondent by the impugned proceedings and consequently, the respondents 4 to 9 were granted patta in respect of the said property. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has argued that the first respondent has got no jurisdiction to pass the present impugned order. Therefore, the point for consideration in this writ petition is as to whether the first respondent as the Revenue Divisional Officer has jurisdiction to cancel the patta granted in favour of the petitioner and consequently, to grant the patta in favour of the respondents 4 to 9?\n13.For proper appreciation of the power conferred on various authorities under the Tamil Nadu Patta Pass-Book Act, 1983, it is relevant to refer Sections 10, 12 and 13 which are as follows:-\n\"10.Modification of entries in the patta pass-book.- (1) Where any person claims that any modification is required in respect of any entry in the patta pass-book already issued under section 3 either by reason of the death of any person or by reason of the transfer of interest in the land or by reason of any other subsequent change in circumstances, he shall make an application to the Tahsildar for the modification of the relevant entries in the patta pass-book. (2) An application under sub-section (1) shall contain such particulars as may be prescribed and shall be accompanied by the documents, if any, relied on by the applicant as evidence in support of his claim.\n(3) (a) Before passing an order on an application under sub-section (1), the Tahsildar shall follow such procedure as may be prescribed and shall also give a reasonable opportunity to the parties concerned to make their representations either orally or in writing. If the Tahsildar decides that any modification should be made in respect of entries in the patta pass-book, he shall pass an order accordingly and shall make such consequential changes in the patta pass-book, as appear to him to be necessary, for giving effect to his order.\n(b) If the Tahsildar decides that there is no case for effecting any modification in the entries in the patta pass-book, he shall reject the application.\n(c) An order under clause (a) or clause (b) shall contain the reason for such order and shall be communicated to the parties concerned in such manner as may be prescribed.\"\n12.Appeal.- Any person aggrieved by an order made by the Tahsildar under this Act may, within such period as may be prescribed, appeal to such authority as may be prescribed and the decision of such authority on such appeal shall subject to the provisions of section 13, be final.\n13.Revision.- Any officer of the Revenue Department not below the rank of District Revenue Officer authorised by the Government, by notification in this behalf for such area as may be specified in the notification, may of his own motion or on the application of a party call for and examine the records of any Tahsildar or appellant authority within his jurisdiction in respect of any proceeding under this Act and pass such orders as he may think fit: Provided that no such order prejudicial to any person shall be made unless he has been given a reasonable opportunity of making his representation.\"\n14.Likewise the relevant Rules under the Tamil Nadu Patta Pass Book Rules, 1987, namely, Rules 12, 14 and 15 are reproduced hereunder:-\n\"12.Application for modification of entries in Patta Pass-Book.- (1) Application for modification of entries in the Patta Pass-Book under Section 10 of the Act shall be in Form - VI and shall be made within ninety days from the date of acquisition of right:-\nProvided that the Tahsildar may for just and sufficient reasons allow a further period of not exceeding ninety days for making an application for this purpose.\n(2) The application under sub-rule (1) shall be affixed with court fee labels of Rs.3 towards fee for this purpose.\n14.Appeal. - An appeal against any order of the Tahsildar passed under the Act shall be filed before the officer in charge of Revenue Division in whose jurisdiction the property lies within a period of thirty days from the date of the receipt of the order.\n15.Revision on application.- (1) An application under section 13 to the District Revenue Officer or such officer as may be authorised by the Government in this behalf by Notification for revision of an order passed by the Tahsildar or the appellate authority shall be filed within ninety days from the date of receipt of the order.\n(2) The District Revenue Officer or such officer as may be authorised by the Government may admit an application for revision presented after expiry of the period mentioned in sub-rule (1), if he is satisfied that the party had just and sufficient cause for not presenting it within the said period.\"\n15.From the reading of the above said provisions under the Tamil Nadu Patta Pass Book Act, 1993 and the Rules made thereunder, it could be seen that the Tashildar is the competent authority under Section 10 for modifications of the relevant entries in the Patta Pass Book and such modifications are also possible only under the following circumstances, namely, (i) by reason of the death of any person; or (ii) by reason of the transfer of interest in the land; or (3) by reason of any other subsequent change in circumstances. Therefore, the Tashildar is empowered to make modification of entry in the Patta Pass Book only under those three circumstances as referred above. Even for making such modification based on application filed by the person, the Tashildar is bound to give reasonable opportunity to the parties concerned to make their representations either orally or in writing. Thereafter, the Tashildar shall pass an order accordingly, and also make such consequential changes in the Patta Pass Book as appears to be necessary for giving effect to his order. If the Tashildar decides that there is no necessity for effecting any modification, he shall reject the application seeking for modification.\n16.Section 12 of the said Act contemplates an appeal against an order made by the Tashildar under the said Act. Rule 14 of the Tamil Nadu Patta Pass Book Rules, 1997, states that the Revenue Divisional Officer is the appellate authority to hear the appeal to be preferred under Section 12. Section 13 contemplates further revision to the Revenue Divisional Officer either on the application of a party or in his own motion.\n17.From the discussion of the above provisions relating to the powers conferred on the Revenue Authorities, it could be seen that the Revenue Divisional Officer, namely, the first respondent herein can exercise the power only as an appellate authority under Section 12 that too as against an order passed by the Tashildar either under section 10 or any other provision under the said Act. From the perusal of the impugned order passed by the first respondent dated 24.07.2006, it is seen that the first respondent has not passed the order as an appellate authority by exercising his power under Section 12. On the other hand, he has passed the order only as an original authority pursuant to a representation given before District Collector by the respondents. It is needless to say that neither District Collector nor the respondents herein can confer the power on the first respondent, which is otherwise not available to him under the Tamil Nadu Patta Pass Book Act, 1983. Though the learned counsel appearing for the 4th respondent has argued that the order passed by the first respondent has to be treated only as an appellate order, a very reading of the order passed by the first respondent would show that the same was not passed against any order passed by the Tashildar and on the other hand, the first respondent had exercised the power as the original authority by taking the role of the Tashildar while such power was not conferred by statute. Therefore, it could be seen that the power exercised by the first respondent in passing the impugned order is not conferred under the Act and consequently, the same is the one passed without jurisdiction.\n18.Even in respect of the power for cancellation of Patta is concerned, section 10 contemplates only modification of entries in the Patta Pass Book Act under three circumstances as referred supra. In my considered view cancellation of Patta cannot be termed as modification of an entry. That is why section 10 deals with only under three circumstances, namely, death of any person, transfer of interest in the land and any other subsequent change in the circumstances. Section 10 does not contemplate any eventuality in respect of rival claim over the title to the property. Section 14 of the said Tamil Nadu Patta Pass Book Act, 1983 takes care of such circumstances where the proviso to section 14 contemplates filing a civil suit by any person if he is aggrieved against any entry made in the Patta Pass Book with regard to any right of which he is in possession. Section 14 is reproduced hereunder for easy reference:-\n\"14.Bar of suits.- No suit shall lie against the Government or any officer of the Government in respect of a claim to have an entry made in any patta pass- book that is maintained under this Act or to have any such entry omitted or amended :\nProvided that if any person is aggrieved as to any right of which he is in possession, by an entry made in the patta pass-book under this Act, he may institute a suit against any person denying or interested to deny his title to such right, for a declaration of his rights under Chapter VI of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 (Central Act 47 of 1963); and the entry in the patta pass-book shall be amended in accordance with any such declaration.\"\n19.In view of the proviso to section 14, if any person is aggrieved over the entry made in the patta pass book in respect of any property over which he claims title and also possession, he can only file a suit for declaration of his right and thereafter, the entry in the patta pass book can be amended in accordance with any such declaration made by the competent civil court. In this case, admittedly, the patta was standing in the name of the petitioner under patta No.949. The petitioner claims title over the property and equally, the respondents 4 to 9 also claim the same. If that is the position, the proper course for the respondents 4 to 9 is to go before the competent civil court and file a civil suit for declaration. Without doing so they cannot agitate the matter before the first respondent straight away seeking for cancellation of patta standing in the name of the petitioner and consequently, seeking for grant of patta in their name. In any event, the petitioner herein has already filed a suit in O.S.No.63 of 2006 before the District Munsif Court, Aruppukkottai and same is pending. It is also an admitted fact that all these respondents are party respondents in the said suit. Therefore, in respect of the dispute over the title to the property, already a civil suit is filed before the competent civil court. Only when a decree is granted, the Revenue Authority can act according to the decree and make necessary changes in the patta pass book. While that being the position, the first respondent is not justified in passing the impugned order. It is needless to say that neither the first respondent nor any other Revenue Authority has got any power or jurisdiction to confer the title of the properties on any person while considering an application for grant of patta or for cancellation of patta. In this connection, it is useful to refer the decision of the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court reported in 2011(2) CWC 242 cited supra at paragraphs 9, 10, 11 and 12 are as follows:- \"9. The Patta Pass Book scheme was introduced in order to ensure that all pattadars of land get pass books, giving up to date details of their holdings and that the patta pass book serves as an effective instrument for revenue administration. For obtaining such patta, an applicant has to prima facie satisfy with the documents or any other information relating to the land to the Tahsildar for his determination and on such determination, the Tahsildar not only makes necessary entries in respect of the land concerned in the Register of Patta Pass Book maintained in the office of the Tahsildar, but also for the purpose of issuing patta pass book to the owner or the person concerned. The entries in the patta pass book shall be presumed to be true and correct until the contrary is proved or a new entry is lawfully substituted.\n10. The patta pass book relating to a particular land shall be produced before the registering authority as defined under sub-section (9) of Section 2 of the Act for the purpose of sale, gift, mortgage, exchange, settlement or otherwise. Unless the patta pass book is produced, the registering authority shall refuse to register the land in terms of Section 5 of the Act. In the event a document is registered after the patta pass book is produced and a certified extract of entries relating to such transfer is produced before the Tahsildar concerned in terms of sub-section (3) of Section 5, the Tahsildar shall cause necessary changes to be carried out in the patta pass book already issued under Section 3 and issue a new patta pass book after sub-division is necessary.\n11. A reading of the above provisions show that an owner or person who has been issued with the patta, if transfers the land by way of sale, gift, etc., and for that purpose registers the same before the registering authority, the person who is the beneficiary of that document can approach the Tahsildar for necessary entries relating to transfer in the patta pass book. In order to find out as to the jurisdiction of the Tahsildar under sub-section (3) of Section 5, we must read Rule 9 of the Tamil Nadu Patta Pass Book Rules, 1987 That rule contemplates that the Tahsildar shall carry out necessary changes in the Register of Patta Pass Books maintained by him within fifteen days from the date of receipt of the certified extracts or the entries of transfers under section 5(2) from the registering authority or a report under section 7 after satisfying himself as to the correctness of the particulars contained therein. Hence, the necessary changes would be only in respect of the registration of alienation or transfer in the patta pass book as enumerated in section 5, which does not contemplate making necessary entries by cancelling the patta without there being any transfer of sale, gift, mortgage etc., of the land in question by the parties in whose name the patta pass book stands registered. This provision does not empower the Tahsildar to cancel the patta pass book granted in favour of person/persons on an application by any other third party.\n12. The only provision available for modification of the entries in the patta pass book is Section 10, which reads as under:-\n\"10. Modification of entries in the patta pass-book.(1) Where any person claims that any modification is required in respect of any entry in the patta pass-book already issued under section 3 either by reason of the death of any person or by reason of the transfer of interest in the land or by reason of any other subsequent change in circumstances, he shall make an application to the Tahsildar for the modification of the relevant entries in the patta pass-book. (2) An application under sub-section (1) shall contain such particulars as may be prescribed and shall be accompanied by the documents, if any, relied on by the applicant as evidence in support of his claim.\n(3)(a) Before passing an order on an application under sub-section (1), the Tahsildar shall follow such procedure as may be prescribed and shall also give a reasonable opportunity to the parties concerned to make their representations either orally or in writing. If the Tahsildar decides that any modification should be made in respect of entries in the patta pass-book, he shall pass an order accordingly and shall make such consequential changes in the patta pass-book, as appear to him to be necessary, for giving effect to his order.\n(b) If the Tahsildar decides that there is no case for effecting any modification in the entries in the patta pass-book, he shall reject the application.\n(c) An order under clause (a) or clause (b) shall contain the reasons for such order and shall be communicated to the parties concerned in such manner as may be prescribed.\"\nBy that provision, in the event any modification is required on an application by any person, it can be made either by reason of the death of any person or by reason of transfer of interest in the land or by reason of any subsequent change in the circumstances. This section also does not empower the Tahsildar to cancel the patta already granted, as the power of the Tahsildar to modify the entries in the patta pass book is limited only in case of death of the person who was holding the patta pass book or by reason of the transfer of interest in the land or by reason of any other subsequent change in the circumstances. In the event an application is made that the patta pass book has been wrongly issued in favour of any person and consequently claiming title over the land entitling such person to grant of patta, that person can only file a suit for declaration that the entries made in the patta pass book should be cancelled and consequently for a mandatory injunction for grant of patta.\"\n20.Likewise, another decision of the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court reported in 2011(5) CTC 241, at paragraphs 30 and 36 are as follows:- \"30.From a reading of Rule 4(4) of the Tamil Nadu Patta Pass Book Rules, it is clear that if the Tahsildar is satisfied that a dispute concerning ownership of patta is already pending in a Court or issues are raised before him which impinge on personal laws or laws of succession and all the parties interested do not agree on the ownership in writing, he shall direct the concerned parties to obtain a ruling on ownership from a competent Civil Court having jurisdiction before changing the entries already recorded and existing in the various Revenue Records. The Learned Single Judge, in paragraph No.19 of the order, had specifically held that in terms of Sub-Rule (4) of Rule 4, the First Respondent / District Revenue Officer ought to have directed the parties to go before the competent Civil Forum for adjudication of dispute with regard to the ownership, as the Fourth Respondent/Writ Petitioner and the Deceased Appellant / Fourth Respondent disputes the version projected by each one of them.\n36.On a careful consideration of the factual position presented in the instant case and in the light of the qualitative and quantitative discussions mentioned supra, we have no hesitation to hold that the dispute between the parties relates to title of the lands measuring an extent of 7.18 acres in S.F.Nos.547 and 548, Kalapatti Village, Coimbatore District and the proper forum for the parties to agitate and ventilate their grievances in respect of their title to the said property is only before the competent Civil Forum. As such, we come to an inevitable conclusion that the Learned Single Judge had rightly held that it is open to the Fourth Respondent/Writ Petitioner and the Deceased Appellant/Fourth Respondent to work out their remedies before the competent Civil Forum in accordance with law. We are also of the considered view that the dispute between the Fourth Respondent/Writ Petitioner and the Deceased Appellant/Fourth Respondent is one of both mixed question of fact and law, which needs to be gone into in detail by means of adducing oral and documentary evidence by examining witnesses as the case may be and the only course open to the parties is to approach the competent Civil Court. \"\n21.The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner also referred to the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in AIR 1954 SC 340 in the matter of Kiran Singh v. Chaman Paswan to substantiate his contention that if an order is passed without jurisdiction, it is nullity. The relevant paragraph 6 of the said judgment is extracted hereunder:-\n6. The answer to these contentions must depend on what the position in law is when a court entertains a suit or an appeal over which it has no jurisdiction, and what the effect of Section 11 of the Suits Valuation Act is on that position. It is a fundamental principle well established that a decree passed by a court without jurisdiction is a nullity, and that its invalidity could be set up whenever and wherever it is sought to be enforced or relied upon, even at the stage of execution and even in collateral proceedings. A defect of jurisdiction, whether it is pecuniary or territorial, or whether it is in respect of the subject-matter of the action, strikes at the very authority of the court to pass any decree, and such a defect cannot be cured even by consent of parties. If the question now under consideration fell to be determined only on the application of general principles governing the matter, there can be no doubt that the District Court of Monghyr was coram non judice, and that its judgment and decree would be nullities. The question is what is the effect of Section 11 of the Suits Valuation Act on this position.\n22.In view of the categorical pronouncements made by the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court as cited supra, the impugned order passed by the first respondent is unsustainable as the same was passed without jurisdiction and consequently, the same is set aside and the parties are directed to get their dispute adjudicated upon by the competent civil Court. Once their title to property is decided and declared by the competent Civil Court, thereafter, it is open to the parties to approach the competent authority under the Patta Pass Book Act for effecting necessary entries in the patta as contemplated under the said Act.\n23.Since I have decided the matter on the question of jurisdiction alone, I need not refer the other citation relied on by the learned counsel appearing for the respective parties. Insofar as the prayer made by the petitioner for ordering an enquiry against the 3rd respondent by the Vigilance and Anti- Corruption Department is concerned, there is absolutely no averments made against the 3rd respondent except by saying that he has acted illegally and passed the impugned order on the eve of transfer.\n24.The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner though relied on the decision reported in AIR 1994 SC 787, 2000(2) SCC 465, 2010 CIJ 245, (cited supra) in support of his contention that the petitioner is entitled to get heavy compensation as against the act of the 3rd respondent by passing the impugned order, in the absence of any specific and material averments made by the petitioner in his affidavit supported by any other documents to substantiate that the 3rd respondent had acted with malice, the above decisions relied on by the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner are not supporting his case for compensation. Therefore, in my considered view, the petitioner has not made out any case for ordering such enquiry. At any event that is not the prayer made in this writ petition. Consequently, the writ petition is allowed and the impugned order is set aside. Connected miscellaneous petitions are closed. No costs.\nskn To\n1.The Revenue Divisional Officer, Aruppukottai.\n2.The Commissioner, Aruppukottai Municipality, Aruppukottai, Virudhunagar District.\n3.Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Win"

Voidable marriages. \u2013 (1) Any marriage solemnized,\nwhether before or after the commencement of this Act, shall be\nvoidable and may be annulled by a decree of nullity on any of the\nfollowing grounds, namely:-\n(a) that the marriage has not been consummated owing to the\nimpotence of the respondent; or\n(b) \u2026...\n(c) \u2026...\n(d) \u2026...\u201d\n2) In the case of V. v. S. (supra), the Division Bench of this\nCourt has observed on the aspect of impotency and sterility by quoting\nthe passage from Modi\u2019s Textbook on Medical Jurisprudence and\nToxicology, Twenty-first Edition. The said observations are as under :\n\"Impotence is defined as physical incapacity of\naccomplishing the sexual act, while sterility means inability\nfor procreation of children. Impotence in males is the\npersistent inability to develop or maintain a penile creation\nsufficient to conclude coitus to orgasm and ejaculation. It\nshould be remembered that the term impotence or sexual\nincapacity in forensic medicine connotes physical incapacity\nto accomplish the sex act.\nImpotence has been described in Halsbury's Laws of England\nto be such a state of mental or physical condition which\nmakes consummation of the marriage a practical\nimpossibility.\nAn impotent individual need not necessarily be sterile, nor a\nsterile individual impotent, though both conditions may\nsometimes be combined in the same individual.\"\n3) While dealing with cases of impotency the predominant\nconsideration is not physical incapacity which courts are\noften guided by, but another all important angle, namely, the\nfact that non consummation of marriage, could be due to\nseveral circumstances which contribute to a situation\nwhereby both the spouses, though physically and mentally\npotent in the normal sense, find it impossible to achieve a\nsatisfactory sexual relationship. The concept of relative\nimpotency which prescribes that a person suffering from no\nhandicap whatever still feels inhibited or incompetent vis\u00adavis\nthe particular sexual partner is now an accepted ground\nfor a decree in a matrimonial Court.\u201d"

Due to relationship, I did not seek any other guarantee instruments or Promissory note.  Now it is nearing 3 years and that he has no intention to repay.  After some months of my lending, he had answered my phone calls in 2 occasions to seek more time to refund. As of now, he completely avoid my phone calls and does not even reply to SMS messages to return my money.  Recently I sent a registered letter demanding immediate refund of my money failing which I will seek legal action to recover my money.

Later in 2013, the land owner revoked the power of attorney from the real estate dealer. Now while we are constructing a house on the land, the land owner is demanding money from us claiming he did not receive any money from the real estate dealer and hence we need to pay money for the land to him. As per the land owner, although POA was given to the real estate dealer, he did not have any rights to sell the land it seems. \r\nAs per as I know once a POA is provided, the POA holder has the rights to sell the land and once done and paid and registered in full, the land belongs to the buyer. Please correct me if I am wrong. As a layman, we have few questions. \r\n\r\nQ1. Can the land owner demand money from us, although we purchased the land when POA was active as well as registered the same with full payment. \r\n\r\nQ2.

Section 50 of the Motor Vehicles Act deals with the transfer of ownership. If the transfer is an another city then a No objection Certificate will be required too.\u00a0\nAnd if you want to do it through another way then you need a two declarations that is buyers and sellers and the declaration will include all the information about the vehicle, date of transfer, details of the seller and buyer and copies of all the other documents of the car i.e. insurance PUC etc. There will be a nominal fee too charged for making the changes in registration.\u00a0\nIf the transfer in Maharashtra you can visit the Maharashtra RTO website too get the copies of the declaration and other forms and make the submissions online personally or through an agent. Thank you.\u00a0\nIf you find our answer helpful please give us a good rating and review."

Further, since the shareholders do not directly participate in the management of the company, there is a clear distinction in a private limited company between the owners of share and the management.

        "query-text": "I have given a complain letter to my local area police station concerning forgery done by my brother and mother by using a duplicate but same looking signature like mine for creating documents like POA , Affidavits and opening demat and bank accounts with various banks.  Also, at the present moment I am demanding a partition to them of my share in my father\u2019s property but have not filed a civil suit yet.\r\n\r\nI met the sub-inspector through my connection with the idea to file a FIR to move things forward quickly and told him that my intention to come to him was to get my brother to do a settlement easily in fear of a criminal case. While he did not register my complain saying he will \u201cMANAGE\u201d the situation, he called my brother in two days ago  and made him accept that it was his/mom\u2019s sign. \r\n\r\nLater when I went to him to get his feedback on what transpired between him and brother he said that my brother has agreed to do the settlement talks between him 15 days later with both our lawyers in the picture at the police station itself. I get a feeling that my brother had shaken hands with him for the same as when I insisted the second time to file an FIR he said that in spite of me giving him 10 forged documents like POA, Affidavits, Bank account opening statement, PPF withdrawal statement etc my case wasn\u2019t fit for a criminal matter and he can not file a FIR.\r\n\r\nI need advice on the following matter.\r\n\r\n1.Just because I do not have any document which talks about money withdrawal from my account or usage of the forged POA and Affidavits,  it isn\u2019t a cognizant case for an FIR.  Is that true? Also because my original documents  copy like PAN card, Adhaar Card, Passport etc have been used in support of this document and they are my blood relation, he said it can be true that I could have told them to make all these documents. Can that be right and proved?\r\n\r\n2.I talked to my appointed lawyer to send a notice to them stating about giving all info about usage of these docs but my lawyer advised not to do so stating that they can apply to for a anticipatory bail and get away.\r\n\r\n3.Should I go meet the  DCP or the Commissioner of my city and ask his advice and request him  to call  the local police station and tell them to file an FIR.\r\n\r\n4.While my intention is not to put my folks behind bars, I DO want to put some pressure and shake them a bit. My appointed advocate said I should not look at FIR option as Forgery is considered to be a very high offence and can not be revoked with an affidavit request. Is that right? He also said all of us would have to go through the entire trial process with hand writing scrutiny and all with an FIR registration before I appear to the court and request them that I would like to withdraw my case against .\r\n\r\n5.Do you think I should file a civil suit parallel with this? How would it help?\r\n\r\n6.Can my brother do  create issues or  arrangements with grace period  of 15 days till the settlement date? How can I get this date pre-poned?",

The notice was sent on 07/10/2021 but the defendant failed to respond within 60 days with the outstanding payments of Rs.60,00,000 towards this loan. \r\nAnother notice was received on the failure to respond back with the owed money to the bank on 28/12/2021. This notice was based on section 13(4) of the securitization and reconstruction of financial assets and enforcement of security interest act. The bank now claims to have submitted the paperwork to the magistrate and is seeking legal auctioning permission from them. \r\n\r\nIn order to deal with this situation with the bank, the defendant closed down on a deal with the purchaser who would like to buy his asset for approximately Rs. 2,20,00,000. This would cover the money owed to the bank. The deal was secured very recently and a Rs 10,00,000 deposit was received towards it. The second installment is scheduled after the property is listed publicly for buyers satisfaction to ensure it has no legal issues or debt associated with it (background screening of the owner). Once posted in the newspaper this could become a red flag as the bank may object especially because the bank has taken aggressive steps on proceeding with security possession already which raises concerns of losing this deal made by the defendant with the purchaser. \r\n\r\nThe issue is that the bank already has paperwork submitted to the magistrate and claims to have no way of revoking this request. The only way the bank suggests can help the defendant is by paying the outstanding and getting the registry of the property immediately. \r\n\r\n1). What are the defense options available for the defendant at this point?\r\n2). Is hiring a lawyer going to help in this situation?\r\n3). Can this situation be delayed?\r\n4). The defendant defaulted on the notices given to him, any way this can be cured?\r\n5). Can the bank revoke their request to pursue possession of the security assets?\r\n6). Can the bank pursue this without going legal? How does this work?\r\n7). Can the bank pursue even when we have the deal made with the buyer for the property invovlved? Can an affidavit be submitted confirming the deal and schedule of values to delay this act allowing the bank to get possession of out property??",

Bank can easily demolish this defense if it can show that notices were duly served and received by borrower. Another defense is that npa was wrongfully declared. Again that won't stop the public auction. If u succeed then the auction sale can be reversed. But auction won't stop unless full dues of the bank are paid with auction expenses incurred so far\n2. Completely your wish. Lawyer is not a magician that somehow magically he will get the auction stopped. He can only submit your legal defenses against the auction which the DRT will decide\u00a0\n3. If you can somehow manage the bank then may be\u00a0\n4. Obviously by making payments to the bank of the demanded amount\u00a0\n5. Yes if you pay up their dues\u00a0\n6. You can give a OTS or a one time settlement and request for debt restructuring. But giving an ots offer means acknowledging the dues of the bank and accepting that as correct\u00a0\n7. Try and approach the bank. The bank can in place of auction go for a private treaty where from the sale price agreed with the buyer the bank will require that its dues be directly paid by buyer to the bank and balance can be paid to borrower by buyer\u00a0\n8. Once magistrate passes an order for possession then the bank will move immediately and take possession with help of police assistance. The bank will then issue a sale notice by auction of 30 days. So you still have 30 more days to pay the dues of the bank. If you pay them then the bank will not conduct the public auction. So it would be in your interest if you tell your buyer to pay the sale price fast so that the property does not go to any third party in public auction\u00a0\nBest way to approach - it's common sense! PAY THE DUES OF THE BANK AND REDEEM YOUR PROPERTY! I DONT THINK THAT IS SO DIFFICULT TO COMPREHEND\u00a0\nOther questions asked are similar questions though in different ways. You are just running round the Bush and wasting time. It would be prudent to expedite the completion of sale with your buyer and from sale proceeds pay the 60 lacs plus other charges of the bank and claim back your property. Approach the bank and inform that you have found a buyer for Rs 2.2 crore and from that he can directly pay the dues of the bank and balance will come to you. The bank will willingly agree for private treaty as its auction expenses would be saved and it also gets it money back. What the bank ultimately wants is its money. Whether its through public auction or private treaty just doesn't matter. Think practically and rationally. It's not your case that the bank is wrongfully demanding the money from you. You seem to have acknowledged the bank's dues.\u00a0\nHope this helps"

These two principles are the sine qua non for a contract which is in restraint of trade.\nSection 27 of Indian contract Act, 1972 states that, \"Agreement in restraint of trade, void \u2013 Every agreement by which any one is restrained from exercising a lawful profession, trade or business of any kind, is to that extent void.\nIn Niranjan Shankar Golikari v. Century Spinning and Manufacturing Company Ltd.,(1967 AIR 1098), the Supreme Court of India considered a case of an employee who hadaccepted the employment offer and signed a contract for a period of five years. The saidcontract contained a stipulation that during the period of employment, the employee shallnot engage in any other business. The Contract also contained a stipulation that during thecontinuation of employment as well as thereafter the employee shall keep confidential, theinformation, instruments and documents of the employer that might come to hisknowledge. In the said case the employee after receiving training and acquiring certainconfidential information, initially remained absent and then tendered resignation, as he hadobtained another employment. The employer did not accept the resignation and tookrecourse against the employee by seeking injunctive relief and damages. The employeechallenged the validity of non-compete and confidentiality clauses, contending that thesame constituted a restraint on trade. Dealing with the said contention, the Supreme Courtheld as under: \u201cThe rule now is that restraints whether general or partial may be good ifthey are reasonable. A restraint upon freedom of contract must be shown to be reasonablynecessary for the purpose of freedom of trade. A restraint reasonably necessary for theprotection of the covenantee must prevail unless some specific ground of public policy canbe clearly established against it\nTherefore you may take proper legal action in case your employer is initiating any legal action on you tendering the resignation."

He heard me and said that he'll talk to the Secretary and rest of the association committee members. In a couple of days I met and spoke to the Secretary also. He too said that he will talk to the rest of the committee members and asked me to give a written letter. I wrote a letter and shared the same with the Secretary. I wrote that my family would ensure that the dog doesn't disturb other apartment residents. I did it to be a good apartment resident and neighbor.\r\nI moved out of India afterwards but my wife, daughter and father-in-law still live in the same apartment. After about 2 months in Jul 2017 my daughter bought a 2 month old puppy and brought it home. My wife and daughter ensured that it is vaccinated. They have ensured that the pup doesn't bark or disturb others or bite or scare any other members of our apartment. They also made sure that the dog doesn't soil any part of the apartment.\r\nAbout a month later in Aug 2017 the Secretary of our Apartment association called and spoke to my wife and daughter asking to discontinue keeping the dog.\r\nI believe that my apartment association has no veto power over my decision to keep a dog in my home so long as I ensure that the dog doesn't bite or bark at other residents or doesn't soil any part of the apartment complex.

                "response-text": "Dear Sir,\nDivorce Laws in India\nDivorce is the legal dissolution of marriage. A divorce is among the most traumatic misfortunes for any couple. The entire process of divorce that starts from coping up with emotional ups and downs to contesting for the long awaited divorce decree for several months is definitely a tough affair to get through. Before opting for a divorce one should be aware of the fact that a divorce procedure in India extents for almost a year and in some special cases of disputes the procedure may continue for years.\nSince India is a land of varied religious communities having their own marriage laws, the divorce procedure too varies, according to the community of the couple seeking divorce. All Hindus as well as Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains can seek divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act 1955. The Muslim, Christian and Parsi communities, on the other hand, have their own laws governing marriage and divorce. Spouses belonging to different communities and castes can seek divorce under the Special Marriage Act, 1956. There is also the Foreign Marriage Act 1969, governing divorce laws in marriages where either partner belongs to another nationality.\nWith the advancement of time and social awareness, several acts have been passed by the government to make the present day divorce procedure in India more progressive with respect to gender affairs and related sensitive issues.\nDivorce laws in India are broadly categorized into \u2018Divorce by Mutual Consent\u2019, \u2018Contested Divorce\u2019, \u2018Void Marriages\u2019, here is a detailed overview about each of them.\n\nDIVORCE WITH MUTUAL CONSENT\n\nUnder Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, the parties can seek divorce by mutual consent by filing a petition before the court. Mutual consent means that both the parties agree for peaceful separation. Mutual Consent Divorce is a simple way of coming out of the marriage and dissolve it legally. Important requirement is the mutual consent of the husband & wife. There are two aspects on which Husband & Wife have to reach to consensus. One is the alimony or maintenance issues. As per Law there is no minimum or maximum limit of maintenance. It could be any figure or no figure. Next important consideration is the Child Custody. This can also be worked out effectively between the parties. Child Custody in Mutual Consent Divorce can be shared or joint or exclusive depending upon the understanding of the spouses.\nCertain common questions about divorce with mutual consent have been answered below:\nWhen can the divorce by mutual consent be filed?\nThe parties intending to dissolve marriage are required to wait for at least one year from the date of marriage.\nThey have to show that they have been living separately for a period of one year or more before the presentation of the petition for divorce and that during this period of separation they have not been able to live together as husband and wife.\nWhere to file the divorce petition?\nIn the family court of the city / district where both the partners lived together for the last time, which was their matrimonial home.\nHow to file divorce petition by mutual consent? What happens in the court?\nThe\u00a0divorce petition\u00a0is in the form of affidavit, which is to be submitted to the family court. After the filing of the petition and recording the statement of both the parties, the court generally adjourns the matter for a period of 6 months.\nAfter six months the parties have to present themselves again in the court for making a second motion confirming the mutual consent filed earlier. It is only after this second motion that a decree of the divorce is granted by the court.\nCan any one party withdraw the mutual consent petition after filing in the court? What will happen by that?\nDuring this period of 6 months when the petition is pending in the court, any of the partner is fully entitled to withdraw the mutual consent by filing an application before the court stating that he/she does not wish to seek divorce by mutual consent.In such circumstances, the court grants no divorce decree.\nWhat can the other partner do under such circumstances?\nThere is no option available to the other party to such circumstances except to file a normal petition for divorce under the provisions of the Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1950.\nIn such a situation divorce can be granted only on certain specified grounds like cruelty; desertion; voluntary sexual inter-course with another person; the other spouse being of unsound mind; conversion of religion by the other spouse; Leprosy; venereal disease; a spouse having renounced the world or being missing for a period of more than 7 years.\nCan the spouse consent for remarriage without getting divorce from existing partner?\nRemarriage without getting divorce is a punishable offence with seven years\u2019 imprisonment.\nIf either of the spouses is not heard for a long time, should the divorce be applied?\nIf there is proof of the absence of spouse without any information to the other spouse about his whereabouts for a continuous seven years period, a petition should be filed in this regard in the court.\nWhen the divorced persons can remarry?\nDepending on the nature of decree, after the expiry of three months from the date of decree if no notice of appeal is received by the person remarrying from the other person.\nWhat are the costs involved in getting divorce by mutual consent?\nIf you hire an advocate, it will be somewhere from Rs25, 000 to Rs75, 000.\nBut if you get the documentation done by us and file on your own without a lawyer, the cost will be very very low. You will not have any problem in filing your petition with our guidance, and you will save a lot of money.\nHow much time does the whole process take from filing the mutual consent petition in the court till the passing of the decree (judgment) by the court?\nIt takes from six months to one year from the date of filing of the petition. It varies from case to case & place to place.\n\nCONTESTED DIVORCE\n\nIn case of a contested divorce, there are specific grounds on which the petition can be made. It isn\u2019t as if a husband or wife can simply ask for a divorce without stating a reason. The reasons for divorce are as follows, though some are not applicable to all religions.\nCruelty\nCruelty may be physical or mental cruelty. According to the Hindu Divorce Laws in India, if one spouse has a reasonable apprehension in the mind that the other spouse\u2019s conduct is likely to be injurious or harmful, then there is sufficient ground for obtaining divorce due to cruelty by the spouse.\nAdultery\nIn India, a man that commits adultery (i.e. has consensual sexual intercourse outside of marriage) can be charged with a criminal offence. The wife may, of course, file for divorce as a civil remedy. If, on the other hand, a wife commits adultery, she cannot be charged with a criminal offence, though the husband can seek prosecution of the adulterer male for adultery.\nDesertion\nOne spouse deserting the other without reasonable cause (cruelty, for example) is reason for divorce. However, the spouse who abandons the other should intend to desert and there should be proof of it. As per Hindu laws, the desertion should have lasted at least two continuous years. Christians, however, will not be able to file a divorce petition solely for this reason.\nConversion\nDivorce can be sought by a spouse if the other spouse converts to another religion. This reason does not require any time to have passed before divorce can be filed.\nMental Disorder\nIf the spouse is incapable of performing the normal duties required in a marriage on account of mental illness, divorce can be sought. If the mental illness is to such an extent that the normal duties of married life cannot be performed.\nCommunicable Disease\nIf the spouse suffers from a communicable disease, such as HIV/AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea or a virulent and incurable form of leprosy, the Hindu Divorce Laws in India say that the other party can obtain a divorce.\nRenunciation of the World\nif the spouse renounces his/her married life and opts for sanyasa, the aggrieved spouse may obtain a divorce.\nPresumption of Death\nIf the spouse has not been heard of as being alive for a period of at least seven years, by such individuals who would have heard about such spouse, if he or she were alive, then the spouse who is alive can obtain a judicial decree of divorce.\nA few common questions about divorce without mutual consent have been answered:\nWhat are the various steps involved in seeking a contested divorce?\nWith a contested divorce, spouses will have to go through numerous steps before the divorce is finalized, including:\n\nprepare, file and serve (deliver) the divorce petition (legal paperwork asking for the divorce and stating the grounds for the breakdown of the marriage)\nrespond to the petition\ninterview and hire an attorney\nengage in \u201cdivorce discovery\u201d \u2013 the information gathering process, which involves various legal procedures to get information from your spouse and third-party witnesses (e.g., written questions, subpoenas, and depositions)\npre-trial legal motions and hearings\nsettlement proposals and negotiations between attorneys\nif settlement fails, prepare for trial\ncomplete a court trial\nAppeal, if you dispute the trial judge\u2019s decision(s).\n\nDuring the settlement phase, spouses are often unable to resolve issues. Although the divorce judge may encourage spouses to work things out, when that doesn\u2019t happen the next step is divorce court.\nDuring trial, both spouses present witnesses, and their lawyers cross-examine the witnesses and present closing arguments. After trial is over, the court will issue a final order memorializing all of the judge\u2019s decisions, and finalize the divorce.\nWhat are the various documents required to file petition for a contested divorce?\n\nAddress proof of husband2. Address proof of wife3. Marriage certificate4. Four passport size photographs of marriage of husband and wife5. Evidence proving spouses are living separately since more than a year6. Evidence relating to the failed attempts of reconciliation7. Income tax statements for the last 2-3 years8. Details of profession and present remuneration9. Information relating to family background10. Details of properties and other assets owned by the petitioner\n\nWhat is the cost involved in getting a contested divorce?\nLawyers tend to charge fees for appearing in court and doing any other work. Depending on how intensely it is fought, therefore, a divorce may cost anywhere from the low ten thousands to lakhs of rupees.\nWhat are different constraints regarding the alimony?\nThe right of maintenance extends to any person economically dependent on the marriage. This will include, therefore, either spouse, dependent children or even indigent parents.\nThe claim of either spouse (though, in the vast majority of cases, it is the wife), however, depends on the husband having sufficient means. When deciding how much alimony is to be paid, the courts will take into account the earning potential of the husband, his ability to regenerate his fortune (in case, say, the property is given to the wife) and his liabilities. In case either spouse is unable to pay for the divorce, these expenses would also be paid by the spouse that does have an income.\nVarious constraints determining the alimony are:\n\nThe age of the person entitled to receive the alimony.\nThe earnings and current financial status of the spouse entitled to pay the alimony.\nThe failing health or a medical condition of one of the spouses who is going to receive the alimony may act in favor of him or her. They can claim a larger alimony on the basis of their failing health.\nThe spouse that retains custody of the child would be entitled to either pay lesser alimony or be entitled to a greater amount while the child is a minor.\n\nWhat are the provisions relating to child custody?\nCourts usually agree to the decision of the parents in a mutual consent divorce, the courts are expected to see to the best interest of the child. In a contested divorce, the courts will examine the ability of the mother or father to be a parent to the child, for example. Money is not usually a matter that is considered. Non-working mothers are regularly given custody of their children, but fathers are expected to provide financial support.\n\nVOID MARRIAGES\n\nFollowing are the grounds which shall render a marriage void or the court shall deem it to be illegal are:\nBigamy\nNone of the parties to the marriage shall have a spouse living in the time of their marriage. If either of them has a spouse alive from an earlier marriage, their subsequent marriage is no marriage in the eyes of law. It is void ab initio and non-existent.\nPersons falling within degrees of prohibited relationships\nLineal ascendants are to be seen from both sides, i.e. from the father\u2019s side as well as from the mother\u2019s side. So both the father and mother are lineal ascendants fall in degrees of prohibited relationships.\nSapinda relations\nSapinda relations can be illustrated as under:Suppose A is a boy. Now if he is considered as one generation, relatives falling in four more generations upwards from him from the side of his father shall be his Sapinda relations. Therefore, A\u2019s father, A\u2019s grand-father, A\u2019s great grand-father and the father of A\u2019s great grand-father shall all be A\u2019s Sapinda relations. But on the mother\u2019s side, this chain is to extend to only three generations which include A. Therefore, A\u2019s mother and A\u2019s maternal grand-mother only shall be A\u2019s Sapinda relations from the mother\u2019 side, A himself being one generation. Marriages made up of such relationships are void.\nA few common questions about void marriages have been answered below:\nWhat are the provisions relating to maintenance of the wife?\nAnother significant question that now arises is whether the wife whose marriage is void under section 11 of the Act can claim maintenance from her husband of that void marriage. The Supreme Court has held that where a marriage is void, wife cannot claim maintenance under sec. 488 .However it is a generally accepted rule that even in such cases, the wife is entitled to maintenance under sec. 18 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act and also under section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act.\nAre the children born from void marriages legitimate?\nHindu Marriage Act 1955 confers legitimacy upon the children born out of void marriages. It provides as under:Hence the clear effect of section 16 is that if a child is born out of a wedlock which is subsequently declared to be null and void, that child will not be considered illegitimate but he shall be considered legitimate despite the marriage being illegal from its inception. The section provides a cushion to the children of void marriages and prevents them from being penalized."

                "response-text": "Dear Sir,\nRERA: Homebuyers to get 10% penalty for delay in projects, but is that enough?\nThere are a number of clauses in the Act that aims toward protecting the buyer\u2019s interest and envisage a transparent system in the real estate sector.\nIn a bid to protect the interest of homebuyers as well as weed out non-serious and unscrupulous players from the market, the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA) has proposed heavy penalties on builders who will henceforth either delay their projects or won\u2019t comply with RERA norms.\nFor instance, RERA recommends imprisonment for a term which may extend up to three years, or fine which may extend up to 10% of the estimated cost of the real estate project, or both, in case of non-compliance with the Act. Moreover, in case of any structural defects arising within five years of handing over the possession of project to buyers, developers will be liable to rectify such defects without further charge.\nIf a project is delayed, which has become the sector norm today, developers are required to pay 10% interest to the buyers on the invested amount as against the Rs 5 to Rs 10 per sq feet penalty contracted in the sales agreement. It may be noted that a majority of developers are currently charging 12% to 18% \u2013 going up to 36% in some cases \u2013 interest from buyers for any delay in payment, while they themselves usually pay in the range of Rs 5 to Rs 10 per sq ft even in case of a luxurious project, which is not a fair deal to buyers.\nHowever, after coming into force, RERA has raised the expectations of buyers multifold. In fact, the buyers who suffered from the delay in delivery of the projects or the delivered product not being as promised at the time of booking in terms of quality, specification, and carpet area etc. are looking towards this Act with high hopes.\nUP has included compounding of offence clause to avoid imprisonment and even the compounding has been limited to \u2018maximum 10% of the estimated cost of the real estate project\u2019, which means it may even be zero in some cases. Please read following link:\nBig relief to UP builders, Yogi Adityanath government redefines ongoing projects\nThe Uttar Pradesh government\u2019s real estate rules have amended the definition of an \u201congoing project\u201d, allowing a builder to be exempt from the purview of Real Estate Regulation Act (RERA) even if he has just applied for a licence or received a part-completion certificate before the Act was notified.This effectively means that those builders who do not complete projects and leave home buyers in the lurch cannot be penalised as per RERA guidelines.\nClauses related to penalties for non-compliance by developers have also been diluted. While Central RERA recommends imprisonment for a term which may extend up to three years, or fine which may extend up to 10% of the estimated cost of the real estate project, or both, UP has included compounding of offence clause to avoid imprisonment and even the compounding has been limited to \u2018maximum 10% of the estimated cost of the real estate project\u2019, which means it may even be zero in some cases.\nThis is likely to encourage corruption as quantum of money to be paid will be at the discretion of the authority. As was given in the central draft rules and also provided in the final rules, this should be rolled back to match the Centre\u2019s rule on \u2018compounding\u2019,\u201d says Abhay Upadhyay national convener of Fight for RERA. As on date, around 834 developers have registered with the portal.\n\u201cUP has decided to keep all those projects outside the purview of RERA which have been either issued, or have applied for occupancy certificates. The main problem here is that of delayed possession. Projects that were launched 7-10 years back are still not completed. And because of this clause they will get an escape route. Home buyers who are battling these builders will find no redressal under RERA,\u201d said Indresh Gupta, co-founder, Noida Extension Flat Owners\u2019 Association.\nAccording to industry officials, in Noida alone, around 50 under-construction group housing projects have been delayed by three to four years due to the slowdown in the realty sector. This has affected around one lakh buyers who had invested in projects that were to be delivered by 2012.\nIn Greater Noida, around 3 lakh home buyers in 63 delayed realty projects are yet to get possession of flats that were to be delivered from 2012. Similarly, 13 realty projects in the Yamuna Expressway industrial area, along the 165-km Yamuna Expressway connecting Greater Noida with Agra, are yet to be delivered.\n\u201cBy exempting projects for which an application for completion or occupation certificate (CC/OC) has been made on or before the rules are notified, UP has taken a lenient attitude towards builders. A CC is a certificate given by the competent authority that the real estate project has been developed according to the sanctioned plan, layout and specifications as approved by the authority. An OC is a certificate issued by the competent authority to the developer permitting buyers to move into their apartments.\nThe Uttar Pradesh government\u2019s decision to continue with the watered-down version of RERA rules that were notified by the Samajwadi Party government in October last year, has come as a major setback to home buyers in the state. These diluted rules are far more lenient to builders than those in the central RERA or Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 and therefore make it easier for them to evade the regulator.\nUpadhyay of Fight for RERA said the UP real estate rules are a huge let down. \u201cThe state rules have redefined \u2018ongoing projects\u2019 in direct contradiction to central Act provisions and it excludes many ongoing projects from the RERA ambit as a favour to the builders. If not withdrawn, it will ensure the failure of RERA in providing justice to home buyers of any ongoing project,\u201d he said.\nhttp://www.financialexpress.com/economy/big-relief-to-up-builders-yogi-adityanath-government-redefines-ongoing-projects/787305/\nhttp://www.financialexpress.com/money/rera-homebuyers-to-get-10-penalty-for-delay-in-projects-but-is-that-enough/659011/"

During the course of 1.5 years of marriage she has spent most of her time at her parents home. Recently we found out that she had been married before, on some further investigation we were able to trace her previous husband and he confirmed that the marriage ended mutual consent but not through Court, it was done via a notary. In the meantime she has filed a false court case citing DV seeking compensation and maintenance from my brother-in-law. My question is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Can my brother-in-law file a police compliant under Sections 420 (cheating), 494 (marrying again during lifetime of husband) and 495 (offence with concealment of former marriage from person with whom subsequent marriage is contracted).\r\n\r\n2. As the case against my brother-in-law is built on false grounds, in our response we want to declare the marriage null and void under IPC section 494, section 5(1), 11 under Hindu marriage act both declaring 2nd marriage illegal (null and void) and therefore seek dismissal of the case from the court. \r\n\r\n3. Can we file a divorce case against them for bigamy and seek compensation for the amount spend on marriage, harassment, cheating and fraud under IPC Section 415 and Section 420. \r\n\r\nYour views in the above matter will be greatly appreciated.",

Even his staff members are no more staying in there office. The flat is locked so far. Once or twice I could find one of his staff. Asked him to convey the msg. But no one tried to pay the rent or electricity bill. \r\nIf we consider the advance paid by him and adjust it over the arrears, then advance are completely absorbed and electricity bill is still left to be paid.\r\nThere was never a written agreement. But recently a month bank we received a call from one of the local banks. Where they enquired about the tenant's whereabouts regarding non payment of loan overdues. He said that they have received a rent agreement. We were socked to here this as there has never been any agreement. The signatures were fordged. The tenant has even managed to get GST number and adhaar on our address using forged rent agreement.\r\nShould we paste a notice on the door of their office for clearing the premises and vacating the same. Or seal the office? Please suggest a way out.",

Since most definitely there will be no one to receive the notice and the post man delivering will even make the observation if some neighbour (or you) informs him that they have not been here from past 6 months. Such observation will come in handy. Preserve the receipt of notice. Now thereafter you can paste the notice on any conspicuous place in the property and take a photograph of it preferably from a camera with a reel(negative to file in court with photograph for proof). All this will be conclusive proof of service of notice in compliance with section 106 transfer of property act. It is important to follow the procedure since service of notice is integral part of eviction suit.\nNow I suggest in the notice you mention that you have adjusted the security towards electricity. It will be easier otherwise you have to claim electricity seperate from rent and it becomes a bit complicated.\nImmediately file an FIR against them for fraud and cheating and forgery under relavent sections of IPC. If police doesn't register engage a lawyer and file application under section 156(3) before court."

As I had no options at that time, I asked for more time from B. They gave me a three weeks. However, even within that time frame A could not complete its procedures because of the large number of applications. So I had to informally accept the offer from B. Now B has sent me an employment agreement letter, and asked me sign and send it back to them. The employment effective date is quoted as 1st January 2023. However, it is likely that I will get some update from A by October (the outcome could be positive or negative).
